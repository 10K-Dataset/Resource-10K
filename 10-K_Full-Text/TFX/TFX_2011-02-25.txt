PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Teleflex Incorporated is referred to herein as “we,”
    “us,” “our,” “Teleflex” and the
    “Company.”

THE
    COMPANY

Teleflex is principally a global provider of medical technology
    products that enable healthcare providers to improve patient
    outcomes and enhance patient and provider safety. We primarily
    develop, manufacture and supply single-use medical devices used
    to provide access to the body for common diagnostic and
    therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgery. Our focus
    is on medical technology solutions that provide

cost-effective

clinical benefits and enable healthcare providers to reduce
    infection, provide less invasive access and improve patient
    safety. We serve hospitals and healthcare providers in more than
    130 countries.

While we are committed to becoming exclusively a medical
    technology company, we continue to operate businesses that serve
    non-medical niche segments of the aerospace and commercial
    markets with specialty engineered products. We expect to
    strategically divest these businesses over time. Our aerospace
    products include cargo-handling systems, containers and pallets
    for commercial air cargo. Our commercial products include driver
    controls, engine assemblies and drive parts for the marine
    industry.

We are focused on achieving consistent, sustainable, profitable
    growth. We believe that we will achieve revenue growth by
    introducing new products and product line extensions, expanding
    our geographic reach, leveraging our existing distribution
    channels, and further investing in global sales channels. We may
    also achieve revenue growth through select acquisitions that
    enhance or expedite our development initiatives and our ability
    to increase our market share.

We anticipate that margin expansion will be achieved by
    increasing our focus on sales of higher margin product lines and
    through initiatives intended to improve operational
    effectiveness. Our margin expansion initiatives may include
    consolidation and improvements in the efficiency of our
    distribution and supply chain, consolidation and productivity
    improvements of manufacturing locations, and further initiatives
    to reduce general and administrative expenses. We expect that
    some of these cost savings will be offset by increases in
    spending in research and development designed to support new
    product activity.

We believe our research and development capabilities,
    established global sales channels, and lean low cost
    manufacturing allow us to bring cost-effective innovative
    products to market that help clinicians to improve the safety,
    efficacy and quality of patient care.

Teleflex provides a broad-based platform of medical technology
    products, which we categorize into four groups: Critical Care,
    Surgical Care, Cardiac Care and OEM and Development Services.

Critical

    medical device manufacturers, which include our Beere Medical,
    KMedic, Specialized Medical Devices, Deknatel and TFXOEM
    customized medical instruments, implants and components.

HISTORY AND
    RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Teleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision
    mechanical push/pull controls for military aircraft. From this
    original single market, single product orientation, we have
    grown through an active program of development of new products,
    introduction of products into new geographic or end-markets and
    through acquisitions of companies with related market,
    technology or industry expertise. Throughout our history, we
    have continually focused on providing innovative,
    technology-driven, specialty-engineered products that help our
    customers meet their business requirements.

Over the past several years, we have engaged in an extensive
    acquisition and divestiture program to improve margins, reduce
    cyclicality and focus our resources on the development of our
    healthcare business. We



have significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of
    businesses, expanding our presence in the medical device
    industry, while divesting many of our businesses serving the
    aerospace and industrial markets. The most significant of these
    transactions occurred in 2007 with our acquisition of Arrow
    International, a leading global supplier of catheter-based
    medical technology products used for vascular access and cardiac
    care, and the divestiture of our automotive and industrial
    businesses. Our acquisition of Arrow significantly expanded our
    disposable medical product offerings for critical care, enhanced
    our global footprint and added to our research and development
    capabilities.

We regularly evaluate the composition of the portfolio of our
    products and businesses to ensure alignment with our overall
    objectives. We strive to maintain a portfolio of products and
    businesses that provide consistency of performance, improved
    profitability and sustainable growth.

On January 30, 2011, Benson F. Smith was named Chairman,
    President and Chief Executive Officer replacing Jeffrey P.
    Black, who resigned by mutual agreement with our Board of
    Directors. Mr. Smith has served as a Director on our Board since
    April 2005. For more information regarding Mr. Smith’s
    background and experience, see “Executive Officers.”

OUR BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS

We operate our businesses through three segments, the largest of
    which is our Medical Segment, which represented 80 percent
    of our consolidated revenues and 87 percent of our segment
    operating profit in 2010. Our Aerospace and Commercial segments
    represented 10 percent and 10 percent of consolidated
    revenues, respectively, and 7 percent and 6 percent of
    segment operating profit, respectively, in 2010.

Additional information regarding our segments and geographic
    areas is presented in Note 17 to our consolidated financial
    statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Medical

Our Medical Segment designs, develops, manufactures and supplies
    medical devices for critical care and surgical applications. We
    categorize our medical products into four product groups:
    Critical Care, Surgical Care, Cardiac Care, and OEM and
    Development Services.

Approximately 50 percent of our segment revenues are
    derived from customers outside the United States. Our Medical
    Segment operates 30 manufacturing sites, with major
    manufacturing operations located in Czech Republic, Malaysia,
    Mexico and the United States.

The following is an overview of the four product groups within
    our Medical Segment.

Critical
    Care

Critical care, which is predominantly comprised of single use
    products, constitutes the largest product category within our
    Medical Segment, representing 66 percent of segment
    revenues in 2010. Our medical products are used in a wide range
    of critical care procedures for vascular access, respiratory
    care, anesthesia and airway management, treatment of urologic
    conditions and other specialty procedures.

We are a leading provider of specialty products for critical
    care. Our products are generally marketed under the brand names
    of Arrow, Rüsch, HudsonRCI, Gibeck and Sheridan. The large
    majority of sales for disposable medical products are made to
    the hospital/healthcare provider market, with a smaller
    percentage sold to alternate sites.

Vascular Access
    Products

Our vascular access products, which accounted for
    29 percent of Medical Segment revenues in 2010, are
    generally catheter-based products used in a variety of clinical
    procedures to facilitate multiple critical care



therapies including the administration of intravenous
    medications and other therapies, and the measurement of blood
    pressure and taking of blood samples through a single puncture
    site.

Our vascular access catheters and related devices consist
    principally of central venous access catheters such as the
    following:

•

the Arrow-Howe’s Multi-Lumen Catheter, a catheter equipped
    with three or four channels, or lumens;

•

double-and single-lumen catheters, which are designed for use in
    a variety of clinical procedures;

•

the Arrow Pressure Injectable CVC, which gives clinicians who
    perform contrast-enhanced CT scans the option of using an
    indwelling pressure injectable Arrow CVC without having to
    insert another catheter for their scan; and

•

percutaneous sheath introducers, which are used as a means for
    inserting cardiovascular and other catheterization devices into
    the vascular system during critical care procedures.

Many of our vascular access catheters are treated with the
    ARROWg+ard or ARROWg+ard Blue Plus antimicrobial surface
    treatments to reduce the risk of catheter related bloodstream
    infections. ARROWg+ard Blue Plus provides antimicrobial
    treatment of the interior lumens and hubs of each catheter.

We also provide a range of peripherally inserted central
    catheters, or PICCs, which are soft, flexible catheters inserted
    in the upper arm and advanced into the superior vena cava and
    are accessed for administration of various types of intravenous
    medications and therapies, Our offerings include a pressure
    injectable peripherally inserted catheter which addresses the
    therapeutic need for a catheter that can withstand the higher
    pressures required by the injection of contrast media for CT
    scans. The three newest additions to the PICC portfolio in the
    United States include:

•

ArrowEVOLUTION PICC with Chlorag+ard technology, a
    pressure-injectable PICC treated with a chlorhexidine-based
    solution from tip to hub on both the inner and outer lumen
    surfaces;

•

a device utilizing Accelerated Seldinger Technique to make the
    placement of PICCs faster, safer and simpler; and

•

The VasoNova Vascular Positioning System is a central venous
    catheter tip navigation system designed to provide clinicians
    precise and consistent placement of the catheter tip,
    significantly increasing the success rate of first time
    placement, shortening hospital stays and lowering costs
    associated with catheter insertion procedures.

Introduced in 2010, Chlorag+ard is our newest coating technology
    for use on some peripherally inserted central catheters,
    providing a reduction in colonization of pathogens responsible
    for causing catheter — related bloodstream infections
    for up to 30 days.

As part of our ongoing efforts to meet physicians’ needs
    for safety and management of risk of infection in the hospital
    setting, we offer many of our vascular access catheters in a
    Maximal Barrier Precautions Tray. The tray is available for
    central venous (CVC), multi access (MAC) and peripheral venous
    access (PICC) and includes a full body drape, coated or
    non-coated catheter and other accessories.

The features of these kits were created to assist healthcare
    providers in complying with guidelines for reducing
    catheter-related bloodstream infections that have been
    established by a variety of health regulatory agencies, such as
    the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Joint
    Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.

Our newest offering is the ErgoPack system designed to support
    consistent compliance with established guidelines for infection
    prevention and safety measures during catheter insertion. The
    system provides components which are packaged in the tray in the
    order in which they will be needed during the procedure and



incorporates features intended to enhance ease of use and
    patient and provider safety. The ErgoPack system is offered for
    CVC, PICC, MAC and Acute Hemodialysis product offerings.

Our vascular access products also include specialty catheters
    and related products used in a range of other procedures and
    include percutaneous thrombolytic devices, which are designed
    for clearance of thrombosed hemodialysis grafts in chronic
    hemodialysis patients; hemodialysis access catheters, including
    the
    Cannon

®

Catheter, which is used to facilitate dialysis treatment, and
    radial artery catheters, which are used for measuring arterial
    blood pressure and taking blood samples.

Respiratory
    Care

Our respiratory care products, which accounted for
    12 percent of Medical Segment revenues in 2010, principally
    consist of devices used in aerosol and medication delivery,
    oxygen therapy and ventilation management. We offer an extensive
    range of aerosol therapy products, including: the Micromist
    Nebulizer for small volumes; the Neb-U-Mask System, which is a
    combination device that enables concurrent delivery of
    aerosolized medications and high concentrations of oxygen or
    heliox; and the Opti-Neb Pro Compressor, which is a compact
    compressor available with both reusable and disposable
    nebulizers. We are also a global provider of oxygen supplies,
    offering a broad range of products to deliver oxygen therapy
    safely and comfortably. These include masks, cannulas, tubing
    and humidifiers. These products are used in a variety of
    clinical settings including hospitals, long-term care
    facilities, rehabilitation centers and patients’ homes to
    treat respiratory ailments such as chronic lung disease,
    pneumonia, cystic fibrosis and asthma.

Our ventilation management products are designed to promote
    patient safety and maximize clinician efficiency. These products
    include ventilator circuits with an extended life to support
    clinical practice guidelines, high efficiency particulate air
    (HEPA) filters that provide protection against the transmission
    of bacteria and viruses, heat and moisture exchangers that
    reduce circuit manipulation and cross-contamination risk and
    heated humidifiers that promote patient compliance to
    non-invasive respiratory strategies, such as non-invasive
    ventilation and high flow oxygen therapy. Recently introduced
    products include the Gibeck HumidFlo heat and moisture
    exchanger, which enables medication to be delivered without
    breaking the breathing circuit or interrupting ventilation, and
    OSMO, a product that enables maintenance free water removal from
    the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit during mechanical
    ventilation (breathing systems used to deliver medical gases
    from a ventilator to a patient’s lungs).

Our ConchaTherm Neptune is a heated humidification solution. It
    is designed to enable the caregiver to customize patient
    treatment to enhance patient outcomes while maintaining
    clinician efficiency.

During 2010, we launched the Gibeck Humid-Flo

72-Hour

Passive Humidification Kit, an integrated system that promotes
    best practices for Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) risk
    reduction. This unique kit includes all the components the
    caregiver needs to begin passive humidification for mechanically
    ventilated patients.

Anesthesia and
    Airway Management

Our anesthesia and airway management products, which accounted
    for 15 percent of our Medical Segment revenues in 2010,
    include endotracheal tubes, laryngeal masks, airways and face
    masks to deliver anesthetic agents and oxygen. To assist in the
    placement of endotracheal tubes, we provide a comprehensive and
    unique line of laryngoscope blades and handles, including
    standard halogen and fiber optic light sources. In 2010, we
    expanded our endotracheal tube offerings with the introduction,
    in both the United States and Europe, of the Teleflex ISIS HVT,
    which features an integrated suction port and separate suction
    line allowing for subglottic secretion suctioning on demand.
    When needed, the suction tube attaches to the ISIS HVT via a
    secure locking connection. We also extended our tracheostomy
    product line offered in the EMEA region (Europe, the Middle



East and Africa) with the introduction of Crystal Clear Trach
    and TracFlex Plus and our laryngeal mask product offerings with
    the introduction of SureSeal laryngeal mask with Cuff Pilot.

Our regional anesthesia or acute pain management products
    include epidural, spinal and peripheral nerve block catheters.
    Nerve blocks provide pain relief during and after surgical
    procedures and help clinicians better manage each patient’s
    pain. We offer the first stimulating continuous nerve block
    catheter, the Arrow StimuCath, which confirms the positive
    placement of the catheter next to the nerve. The Arrow Flex Tip
    Plus continuous epidural catheter features a soft, flexible tip
    that helps reduce the incidence of complications, such as
    transient paresthesia (a sensation of tingling, pricking, or
    numbness of a person’s skin) and inadvertent penetration of
    blood vessels or the dura, while improving the clinician’s
    ability to thread the catheter into the epidural space. Our
    Arrow TheraCath epidural catheter, with high compression
    strength for direction-ability and enhanced radiopacity (the
    ability to stop the passage of x-rays), was designed for pain
    management procedures where increased steer-ability is
    important. Additional integral components create a range of
    standard and custom procedural kits. In 2009, we introduced a
    new line of kits designed for administration of anesthesia,
    marketed under the Arrow SureBlock Spinal Anesthesia brand name.

Urology

Our line of urology products, which accounted for
    10 percent of our Medical Segment revenues in 2010,
    provides bladder management for patients in the hospital and
    home care markets. Our product portfolio consists principally of
    a wide range of catheters (including Foley, intermittent,
    external and suprapubic), urine collectors, catheterization
    accessories and products for operative endurology marketed under
    the Rusch brand name.

Our urology business in Europe and the United States also serves
    home care markets and patient care outside of the hospital. Over
    the past few years, we have expanded our offerings for these
    markets to include a wider range of intermittent catheters,
    catheter insertion kits and accessories used by quadriplegic and
    paraplegic people. Many of these products are designed to
    support patient safety and infection prevention efforts. For
    example, we recently introduced an intermittent catheter with
    hydrophilic coating, an Ergothan tip, protective sleeve and
    saline solution in our EMEA region.

Home care markets are subject to local and regional
    reimbursement regulations that can impact volumes and pricing.
    For example, in the United States, reimbursement regulations
    were implemented in 2008 that permit reimbursement for up to 200
    catheters per month, replacing the previous limit of four
    catheters per month. The change promoted a shift from re-useable
    catheters, with their inherent risk of infections, to single use
    intermittent catheters. Sales of our intermittent catheters in
    the U.S. have benefited from this change in reimbursement
    policy.

Surgical
    Care

Surgical care, which is predominantly comprised of single use
    products, represented 18 percent of Medical Segment
    revenues in 2010. Our surgical products include: ligation and
    closure products, including appliers, clips, and sutures used in
    a variety of surgical procedures; access ports used in minimally
    invasive surgical procedures including robotic surgery; and
    fluid management products used for chest drainage. Our surgical
    products also include hand-held instruments for general and
    specialty surgical procedures. We market surgical products under
    the Deknatel, Pleur-evac, Pilling, Taut and Weck brand names.

Hem-o-lok, a significant part of the Weck portfolio, is a unique
    locking polymer ligation clip that combines the security of a
    suture with the speed of a metal clip for open and laparoscopic
    surgery. Hem-o-lok clips have special applications in robotic,
    laparoscopic and cardiovascular surgery.

Recently introduced products include the Taut Universal Seal
    designed for use with the ADAPt line of bladeless laparoscopic
    access devices, a rotating head stapler and a new long
    endoscopic clip applier. In 2010, we extended our line of
    cardiovascular sutures with the introduction of Deklene Maxx.



Cardiac
    Care

Cardiac care products accounted for approximately 5 percent
    of Medical Segment revenues in fiscal 2010. Products in this
    category include diagnostic catheters and capital equipment. Our
    diagnostic catheters include thermodilution and wedge pressure
    catheters; specialized angiographic catheters, such as Berman
    and Reverse Berman catheters; therapeutic delivery catheters,
    such as temporary pacing catheters; and intra-aortic balloon, or
    IAB, catheters. Capital equipment includes our intra-aortic
    balloon pump, or IABP, consoles. IABP products are used to
    augment oxygen delivery to the cardiac muscle and reduce the
    oxygen demand after cardiac surgery, serious heart attack or
    interventional procedures.

The IAB and IABP product lines feature the AutoCAT 2 WAVE
    console and the FiberOptix catheter, which together utilize
    fiber optic technology for arterial pressure signal acquisition
    and enable the patented WAVE timing algorithm to support the
    broadest range of patient heart rhythms, including severely
    arrhythmic patients.

    in Germany, Norway, Sweden, Singapore and China.

Cargo-handling
    Systems and Equipment

Our cargo-handling systems include on-board automated
    cargo-loading systems for wide-body aircraft, baggage-handling
    systems for narrow body aircraft, aftermarket spare parts and
    repair services. Marketed under the Telair International brand
    name, our wide-body cargo-handling systems are sold to aircraft
    original equipment manufacturers or to airlines and air freight
    carriers as “seller

and/or

buyer
    furnished equipment” for original installations or as
    retrofits for existing equipment. Cargo-handling systems require
    a high degree of engineering sophistication.

Telair International is the exclusive supplier of main deck and
    lower deck cargo systems for the new Boeing

747-8

airliner. Telair is also the exclusive provider of lower deck
    systems for the Airbus A330/A340-200 and 300 aircraft. Telair
    has been selected to supply cargo systems for the Airbus A350
    XWB airframe when it enters production. Telair is also the
    exclusive supplier of sliding carpet systems for bulk-loading of
    narrow body aircraft such as 737 and A320 passenger planes. The

GOVERNMENT
    REGULATION

Government agencies in a number of countries regulate our
    products and the products sold by our customers that incorporate
    our products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and
    government agencies in other countries regulate the approval,
    manufacturing, sale and marketing of many of our healthcare
    products. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the
    European Aviation Safety Agency regulate the manufacture and
    sale of most of our aerospace products and license the operation
    of our repair stations. For more information, see Item 1A.
    “Risk Factors.”



COMPETITION

Medical
    Segment

The medical device industry is highly competitive. We compete
    with many companies, ranging from small

start-up

enterprises to companies that are larger and more established
    than us with access to significant financial resources.
    Furthermore, new product development and technological change
    characterize the market in which we compete. We must continue to
    develop and acquire new products and technologies for our
    Medical Segment businesses to remain competitive. We believe
    that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority
    and innovative features that enhance patient benefit, product
    reliability, performance, customer and sales support, and
    cost-effectiveness. Competitors of our Medical Segment include
    C. R. Bard, Inc., Covidien and CareFusion.

Aerospace and
    Commercial Segments

The businesses within our Aerospace and Commercial segments
    generally face significant competition from competitors of
    varying sizes. We believe that our competitive position depends
    on the technical competence and creative ability of our
    engineering personnel, the know-how and skill of our
    manufacturing personnel, and the strength and scope of our
    sales, service and distribution networks. Competitors of the
    businesses with our Aerospace Segment include Goodrich
    Corporation, AAR Corp and Driessen Aerospace Group. Competition
    for our Commercial business tends to be fragmented.

SALES AND
    MARKETING

Medical
    Segment

Our medical products are sold directly to hospitals, healthcare
    providers, distributors and to original equipment manufacturers
    of medical devices through our own sales forces and through
    independent representatives and independent distributor networks.

Aerospace and
    Commercial Segments

Products sold to the aerospace market are sold through our own
    field representatives and distributors. The majority of our
    Commercial Segment products are sold through a direct sales
    force of field representatives and technical specialists. Marine
    driver controls and engine and drive parts are sold directly to
    boat builders and engine manufacturers as well as through
    distributors, dealers and retail outlets to reach recreational
    boaters.

BACKLOG

Medical
    Segment

Most of our medical products are sold to hospitals or healthcare
    providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or
    weeks, with longer order times for products sold to medical
    device manufacturers. Therefore, the backlog of our Medical
    Segment orders is not indicative of probable revenues in any
    future

12-month

period.

Aerospace
    Segment

As of December 31, 2010, our backlog of firm orders for our
    Aerospace Segment was $74 million, of which we expect
    approximately 100 percent to be filled in 2011. Our backlog
    for our Aerospace Segment on December 31, 2009 was
    $35 million.



Commercial
    Segment

Standard Commercial Segment products are typically shipped
    between a few days and three months after receipt of order.
    Therefore, the backlog of such orders is not indicative of
    probable revenues in any future

12-month

period.

PATENTS AND
    TRADEMARKS

We own a portfolio of patents, patents pending and trademarks.
    We also license various patents and trademarks. Patents for
    individual products extend for varying periods according to the
    date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in
    the various countries where patent protection is obtained.
    Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of
    time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks.
    All capitalized product names throughout this document are
    trademarks owned by, or licensed to, us or our subsidiaries.
    Although these have been of value and are expected to continue
    to be of value in the future, we do not consider any single
    patent or trademark, except for the Teleflex and Arrow brands,
    to be essential to the operation of our business.

SUPPLIERS AND
    MATERIALS

Materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased
    from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic
    locations. We are not dependent on any single supplier for a
    substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied
    for our overall operations. Most of the materials and components
    we use are available from multiple sources, and where practical,
    we attempt to identify alternative suppliers. Volatility in
    commodity markets, particularly steel and plastic resins, can
    have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of
    our products. We cannot be assured of successfully passing these
    cost increases through to all of our customers, particularly
    original equipment manufacturers.

RESEARCH AND
    DEVELOPMENT

We are engaged in both internal and external research and
    development in our Medical, Aerospace and Commercial segments.
    Our research and development costs in our Medical business
    principally relate to our efforts to bring innovative new
    products to the markets we serve, and our efforts to enhance the
    clinical value, ease of use, safety and reliability of our
    existing product lines. Our research and development efforts
    support our strategic objectives to provide safe and effective
    products that reduce infections, improve patient and clinician
    safety, enhance patient outcomes and enable less invasive
    procedures.

Research and development in our Aerospace and Commercial
    businesses is focused on the development of lighter, more
    durable and more automated systems and products that facilitate
    cargo loading and containment on commercial aircraft and improve
    the performance of recreational boats.

We also acquire or license products and technologies that are
    consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability
    to provide a full range of product and service options to our
    customers.

SEASONALITY

Portions of our revenues, particularly in the Commercial and
    Medical segments, are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Revenues
    in the marine aftermarket generally increase in the second
    quarter as boat owners prepare their watercraft for the upcoming
    season. Incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as
    the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues
    related to disposable medical products.

EMPLOYEES

We employed approximately 12,500 full-time and temporary
    employees at December 31, 2010. Of these employees,
    approximately 3,600 were employed in the United States and 8,900
    in countries outside of the United States. Less than 8% percent
    of our employees in the United States were covered by union
    contracts. We



also have collective-bargaining arrangements or union contracts
    that cover employees in other countries. We believe we have good
    relationships with our employees.

We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934. Therefore, we file reports, proxy
    statements and other information with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission (SEC). Copies of such reports, proxy

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

We are subject to risks that could adversely affect our
    business, financial condition and results of operations. These
    risks include, but are not limited to the following:

Our Medical Segment is subject to extensive government
    regulation, which may require us to incur significant expenses
    to ensure compliance. Our failure to comply with those
    regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results
    of operations and financial condition.

The products within our Medical Segment are classified as
    medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the
    United States by the FDA and by comparable government agencies
    in other countries. The regulations govern the development,
    design, approval, manufacturing, labeling, importing and
    exporting and sale and marketing of many of our medical
    products. These regulations are also subject to future change.
    Failure to comply with applicable regulations and quality
    assurance guidelines could lead to manufacturing shutdowns,
    product shortages, delays in product manufacturing, product
    seizures, recalls, operating restrictions, withdrawal or
    suspension of required licenses, and prohibitions against
    exporting of products to, or importing products from, countries
    outside the United States. We could be required to expend
    significant financial and human resources to remediate failures
    to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance
    guidelines. See, for example the risk factor below titled,
    “— If we are unable to resolve issues raised in
    our FDA corporate warning letter, it could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations, our relationship with the FDA and the perception
    of our products by hospitals, clinics and physicians”. In
    addition, civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion
    under Medicaid or Medicare, could result from regulatory
    violations. Any one or more of these events could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

In the United States, before we can market a new medical device,
    or a new use of, or claim for, or significant modification to,
    an existing product, we must first receive either 510(k)
    clearance or approval of a premarket approval, or PMA,
    application from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the
    510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that our
    proposed product is “substantially equivalent” to a
    device legally on the market, known as a “predicate”
    device, with respect to intended use, technology and safety and
    effectiveness, in order to clear the proposed device for
    marketing. The PMA pathway requires us to demonstrate the safety
    and effectiveness of the device based, in part, on data obtained
    in human clinical trials. Similarly, most major markets for
    medical devices outside the United States also require
    clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before
    a product can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining
    regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device,
    particularly from the FDA and certain foreign governmental
    authorities, can be costly and time consuming, and clearances
    and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely
    basis, if at all. In addition, once a device has been cleared or
    approved, a new clearance or approval may



be required before the device may be modified or its labeling
    changed. Furthermore, the FDA is currently reviewing its 510(k)
    clearance process, and may make the process more rigorous, which
    could require us to generate additional clinical or other data,
    and expend more time and effort, in obtaining future 510(k)
    product clearance. The regulatory clearance and approval process
    may result in, among other things, delayed realization of
    product revenues, in substantial additional costs or in
    limitations on indicated uses of products, any one of which
    could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
    and results of operations.

Even after a product has received marketing approval or
    clearance, such product approval or clearance by the FDA can be
    withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device
    or integrity issues relating to the marketing application. Later
    discovery of violations of FDA requirements for medical devices
    could result in FDA enforcement actions, including warning
    letters, fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances,
    product seizures or recalls, injunctions, advisories or other
    field actions,

and/or

operating restrictions. Medical devices are cleared or approved
    for one or more specific intended uses. Promoting a device for
    an off-label use could result in FDA enforcement action.

Furthermore, our Medical Segment facilities are subject to
    periodic inspection by the FDA and other federal, state and
    foreign governmental authorities, which require manufacturers of
    medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including the
    Quality System Regulation which requires testing, complaint
    handling, periodic audits, design controls, quality control
    testing and documentation procedures. FDA may also inspect for
    compliance with Medical Device Reporting Regulation, which
    requires manufacturers to submit reports to FDA of certain
    adverse events or malfunctions, and whether the facilities have
    submitted notifications of product recalls or other corrective
    actions in accordance with FDA regulations. Issues identified
    during such periodic inspections may result in warning letters,
    manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages, product seizures or
    recalls, fines and delays in product manufacturing, and may
    require significant resources to resolve.

Customers in our Medical Segment depend on third party
    coverage and reimbursement and the failure of healthcare
    programs to provide coverage and reimbursement, or the reduction
    in levels of reimbursement, for our medical products could
    adversely affect our Medical Segment.

The ability of our customers to obtain coverage and
    reimbursements for our medical products is important to our
    Medical Segment. Demand for many of our existing and new medical
    products is, and will continue to be, affected by the extent to
    which government healthcare programs and private health insurers
    reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in
    the countries where we do business. Even when we develop or
    acquire a promising new product, we may find limited demand for
    the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from
    private and governmental third party payors. Internationally,
    healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly, with
    medical centers in some countries having fixed budgets,
    regardless of the level of patient treatment. Other countries
    require application for, and approval of, government or third
    party reimbursement. Without both favorable coverage
    determinations by, and the financial support of, government and
    third party insurers, the market for many of our medical
    products could be adversely affected.

We cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the
    current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for
    use of our existing products. Adverse coverage determinations or
    any reduction in the amount of reimbursement could harm our
    business by altering the extent to which potential customers
    select our products and the prices they are willing to pay or
    otherwise. In addition, as a result of their purchasing power
    and continually rising healthcare costs, third party payors are
    implementing cost cutting measures such as discounts, price
    reductions, limitations on coverage and reimbursement for new
    medical technologies and procedures, or other incentives from
    medical products suppliers. These trends could lead to pressure
    to reduce prices for our existing products and potential new
    products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or
    a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect
    our business, financial condition and results of operations.



We may incur material losses and costs as a result of
    product liability and warranty claims that may be brought
    against us and recalls, which may adversely affect our results
    of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, as a medical
    device company, we face an inherent risk of damage to our
    reputation if one or more of our products are, or are alleged to
    be, defective.

Our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks
    that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of
    our products. In particular, our medical device products are
    often used in surgical and intensive care settings with
    seriously ill patients. Many of these products are designed to
    be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time, and
    component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or
    inadequate disclosure of product-related risks with respect to
    these or other products we manufacture or sell could result in
    an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, the patient. As a
    result, we face an inherent risk of damage to our reputation if
    one or more of our products are, or are alleged to be,
    defective. In addition, our products for the aerospace and
    commercial industries are used in potentially hazardous
    environments. Although we carry product liability insurance, we
    may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the
    event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as
    expected or the use of our products results, or is alleged to
    result, in bodily injury

and/or

property damage. The outcome of litigation, particularly any

class-action

lawsuits, is difficult to quantify. Plaintiffs often seek
    recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, including
    punitive damages. The magnitude of the potential losses relating
    to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of
    time and the cost to defend against any such litigation may be
    significant. Accordingly, we could experience material warranty
    or product liability losses in the future and incur significant
    costs to defend these claims.

In addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be,
    defective, we may voluntarily participate, or be required by
    applicable regulators, to participate in a recall of that
    product if the defect or the alleged defect relates to safety.
    In the event of a recall, we may experience lost sales and be
    exposed to individual or

class-action

litigation claims and reputational risk. Product liability,
    warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws,
    regulation and enforcement; our failure to comply with those
    laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations and financial conditions.

We are also subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and
    enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign
    governments in which we conduct our business. The laws that may
    affect our ability to operate include:

•

the federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Law, which
    prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and
    willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying
    remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to
    induce either the referral of an individual for, or the
    purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for
    which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such
    as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;

•

federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things,
    individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to
    be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or
    other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;

•

the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
    of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created federal criminal laws
    that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare
    benefit program or making false statements relating to
    healthcare matters; and

•

state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as
    anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or
    services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including
    commercial insurers.



If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the
    laws described above or any other governmental regulations that
    apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and
    criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or
    restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from
    participation in federal and state healthcare programs and
    imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to
    operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our
    being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact
    that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the
    regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are
    open to a variety of interpretations.

Further, the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable
    Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education
    Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the
    “Healthcare Reform Act”), among other things, amends
    the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal
    health care fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs
    to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to
    violate it. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Act provides that
    the government may assert that a claim including items or
    services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback
    statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of
    the false claims statutes. Any action against us for violation
    of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could
    cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our
    management’s attention from the operation of our business.

The Healthcare Reform Act also imposes new reporting and
    disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any
    “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers
    and other healthcare providers, effective March 30, 2013.
    Such information will be made publicly available in a searchable
    format beginning September 30, 2013. In addition, device
    manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any
    investment interests held by physicians and their immediate
    family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to
    submit required information may result in civil monetary
    penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to
    an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing
    failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or
    ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual
    submission.

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal
    and state regulation of payments made to physicians for
    marketing. Some states, such as California, Massachusetts and
    Vermont, mandate implementation of commercial compliance
    programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts,
    compensation, and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting
    commercial compliance environment and the need to build and
    maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple
    jurisdictions with different compliance

and/or

reporting requirements increases the possibility that a
    healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the
    requirements.

If we are unable to resolve issues raised in our FDA
    corporate warning letter, it could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations, our relationship with the FDA and the perception of
    our products by hospitals, clinics and physicians.

On October 11, 2007, our subsidiary Arrow received a
    corporate warning letter from the FDA. The letter expressed
    concerns with Arrow’s quality systems, including complaint
    handling, corrective and preventive action, process and design
    validation, inspection and training procedures. It also advised
    that Arrow’s corporate-wide program to evaluate, correct
    and prevent quality system issues had been deficient.

Our efforts to address the issues raised in the corporate
    warning letter have required the dedication of significant
    internal and external resources. We developed and implemented a
    comprehensive plan to correct these previously-identified
    regulatory issues and further improve overall quality systems.
    From the end of 2009 to the beginning of 2010, the FDA
    reinspected the Arrow facilities covered by the corporate
    warning letter and we have responded to the observations issued
    by the FDA as a result of those inspections. Communications
    received from the FDA indicate that the FDA has classified its
    inspection observations as “voluntary action
    indicated,” or VAI. This classification signifies that the
    FDA has concluded that no further regulatory action is required,
    and that any observations made during the inspections can be
    addressed voluntarily by us. In addition, in the third quarter
    of 2010, we submitted and received FDA approval of all currently
    eligible requests



for certificates to foreign governments, or CFGs. We believe
    that the FDA’s approval of these CFG requests is a clear
    indication that we have substantially corrected the quality
    system issues identified in the corporate warning letter. We are
    continuing to work with the FDA to resolve all remaining issues
    and obtain formal closure of the corporate warning letter.

While we continue to believe we have substantially remediated
    the issues raised in the corporate warning letter through the
    corrective actions taken to date, the corporate warning letter
    remains in place pending final resolution of all outstanding
    issues. If our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the FDA,
    we may have to devote additional financial and human resources
    to our efforts, and the FDA may take further regulatory actions
    against us. These actions may include seizing our product
    inventory, assessing civil monetary penalties or seeking an
    injunction against us, which could in turn have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

Health care reform, including the recently enacted
    legislation, may have a material adverse effect on our industry
    and our results of operations.

Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the
    health care industry to fundamental changes. In March 2010, the
    Healthcare Reform Act was enacted. It substantially changes the
    way health care is financed by both governmental and private
    insurers, encourages improvements in the quality of health care
    items and services, and significantly impacts the
    U.S. pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Among
    other things, the Healthcare Reform Act:

•

establishes a 2.3% deductible excise tax on any entity that
    manufactures or imports certain medical devices offered for sale
    in the United States, beginning 2013;

•

establishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute
    to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative
    clinical effectiveness research;

•

implements payment system reforms including a national pilot
    program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians
    and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and
    efficiency of certain health care services through bundled
    payment models, beginning on or before January 1,
    2013; and

•

creates an independent payment advisory board that will submit
    recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected
    Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate.

We currently estimate the impact of the 2.3% deductible excise
    tax to be approximately $16.0 million annually, beginning
    2013. However, we cannot predict at this time the full impact of
    the Healthcare Reform Act

and/or

other
    healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on
    our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

An interruption in our manufacturing operations

and/or

our
    supply of raw materials may adversely affect our
    business.

Many of our key products across all three of our business
    segments are manufactured at single locations, with limited
    alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in damage
    to one or more of our facilities, it may not be possible to
    timely manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or
    at all. In addition, in the event of delays or cancellations in
    shipments of raw materials by our suppliers, it may not be
    possible to timely manufacture the affected products at previous
    levels or at all. Furthermore, with respect to our Medical
    Segment, in the event of a disruption in our supply of certain
    components or materials, due to the stringent regulations and
    requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities
    regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to
    quickly establish additional or replacement sources for such
    components or materials. A reduction or interruption in
    manufacturing, or an inability to secure alternative sources of
    raw materials or components that are acceptable to us, could
    have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations
    and financial condition.



We depend upon relationships with physicians and other
    health care professionals.

The research and development of some of our medical products is
    dependent on our maintaining strong working relationships with
    physicians and other health care professionals. We rely on these
    professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and
    experience regarding our medical products and the development of
    our medical products. Physicians assist us as researchers,
    product consultants, inventors and as public speakers. If we
    fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and
    receive the benefits of their knowledge, advice and input, our
    medical products may not be developed and marketed in line with
    the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and
    support our products, which could have a material adverse effect
    on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We face strong competition. Our failure to successfully
    develop and market new products could adversely affect our
    results.

The medical device industry across all of our different product
    lines, as well as in each geographic market in which our
    products are sold, is highly competitive. We compete with many
    medical device companies ranging from small

start-up

enterprises which might only sell a single or limited number of
    competitive products or which may participate only in a specific
    market segment, to companies that are larger and more
    established than us with access to significant financial and
    marketing resources.

In addition, the medical device industry is characterized by
    extensive product research and development and rapid
    technological advances. Also, while our products for the
    aerospace and commercial industries generally have longer life
    cycles, many of those products require changes in design or
    other enhancements to meet the evolving needs of our customers.
    The future success of our business will depend, in part, on our
    ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and
    to enhance existing products. Our product development efforts
    may require substantial investment by us. There can be no
    assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect
    to the development, performance or market acceptance of new
    technologies or products, such as the inability to:

•

identify viable new products;

•

obtain adequate intellectual property protection;

•

gain market acceptance of new products; or

•

successfully obtain regulatory approvals.

Moreover, we may not otherwise be able to successfully develop
    and market new products or enhance existing products. In
    addition, our competitors may currently be developing, or may
    develop and market in the future, technologies that are more
    effective than those that we develop or which may render our
    products obsolete. Our failure to successfully develop and
    market new products or enhance existing products could reduce
    our revenues and margins, which would have an adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to risks associated with our

non-U.S. operations.

We have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities,
    research and development facilities, sales personnel and
    customer support operations outside the United States in
    countries such as Canada, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France,
    Germany, Ireland, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway and Singapore. As of
    December 31, 2010, approximately 43% of our net property,
    plant and equipment was located outside the United States. In
    addition, approximately 50% of our net revenues (based on
    business unit location) were derived from operations outside the
    United States in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
    Approximately 71% of our full-time and temporary employees as of
    December 31, 2010 were employed in countries outside of the
    United States.



Our international operations are subject to varying degrees of
    risk inherent in doing business outside the United States,
    including:

•

exchange controls, currency restrictions and fluctuations in
    currency values;

•

trade protection measures;

•

potentially costly and burdensome import or export requirements;

•

laws and business practices that favor local companies;

•

changes in

non-U.S. medical

reimbursement policies and procedures;

•

subsidies or increased access to capital for firms who are
    currently or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we
    have operations;

•

scrutiny of foreign tax authorities which could result in
    significant fines, penalties and additional taxes being imposed
    on us;

•

potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;

•

restrictions and taxes related to the repatriation of foreign
    earnings;

•

differing labor regulations;

•

additional U.S. and foreign government controls or
    regulations;

•

difficulties in the protection of intellectual property; and

•

unsettled political and economic conditions and possible
    terrorist attacks against American interests.

In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the
    “FCPA”) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in

non-U.S. jurisdictions

generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from
    making improper payments to

non-U.S. officials

for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA
    also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly
    traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates,
    which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds
    to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to
    prevent the establishment of “off books” slush funds
    from which such improper payments can be made. Because of the
    predominance of government-sponsored health care systems around
    the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the
    United States are with governmental entities and are therefore
    subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate
    compliance with these anti-bribery laws. Despite our training
    and compliance programs, our internal control policies and
    procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal
    acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these
    laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our
    operations, involve significant management distraction and
    result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations. We also could suffer severe
    penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement
    and other remedial measures, including further changes or
    enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, as well
    as potential personnel changes and disciplinary actions.

Furthermore, we are subject to the export controls and economic
    embargo rules and regulations of the United States, including,
    but not limited to, the Export Administration Regulations and
    trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are
    administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the
    Department of the Treasury as well as the laws and regulations
    administered by the Department of Commerce. These regulations
    limit our ability to market, sell, distribute or otherwise
    transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or
    persons. While we train our employees and contractually obligate
    our distributors to comply with these regulations, we cannot
    assure you that there will not be a violation, whether knowingly
    or inadvertently. Failure to comply with these rules and
    regulations may result in substantial penalties, including fines
    and enforcement actions and civil

and/or

criminal sanctions, the disgorgement of profits and the



imposition of a court-appointed monitor, as well as the denial
    of export privileges, and debarment from participation in
    U.S. government contracts, and may have an adverse effect
    on our reputation.

These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on
    our international operations or on our business, results of
    operations and financial condition generally.

Further weakness in general domestic and global economic
    growth combined with a continuation of constrained global credit
    markets could adversely impact our operating results, financial
    condition and liquidity.

We are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general
    domestic and global economic conditions, including recession or
    economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets. The credit
    and capital markets experienced extreme volatility and
    disruption in recent periods, leading to recessionary conditions
    and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending. These
    recessionary conditions have caused customers to reduce, modify,
    delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services.
    While recent indicators suggest modest improvement in the United
    States and global economy, we cannot predict the duration or
    extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our
    customers will return to more normalized spending behaviors. If
    the recessionary conditions return, our customers may terminate
    existing purchase orders or reduce the volume of products or
    services they purchase from us in the future.

Adverse economic and financial market conditions may also cause
    our suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments to us or
    may cause suppliers to make changes in the credit terms they
    extend to us, such as shortening the required payment period for
    outstanding accounts receivable or reducing the maximum amount
    of trade credit available to us. These types of actions by our
    suppliers could significantly affect our liquidity and could
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
    financial condition. If we are unable to successfully anticipate
    changing economic and financial market conditions, we may be
    unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and
    our business could be negatively affected.

In addition, the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets
    on our consolidated balance sheet have increased significantly
    in recent years, primarily as a result of the acquisition of
    Arrow International in 2007. Adverse economic and financial
    market conditions may result in future charges to recognize
    impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other
    intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial results.

Foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and
    interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our
    results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the
    effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity
    prices and interest rates. We expect revenue from products
    manufactured in, and sold into,

non-U.S. markets

to continue to represent a significant portion of our net
    revenue. Our consolidated financial statements reflect
    translation of financial statements denominated in

non-U.S. currencies

to U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. When the
    U.S. dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the
    foreign currencies of the countries where we sell or manufacture
    our products, such as the euro, our U.S. dollar-reported
    revenue and income will fluctuate. Although we have entered into
    forward contracts with several major financial institutions to
    hedge a portion of projected cash flows denominated in
    non-functional currency in order to reduce the effects of
    currency rate fluctuations, changes in the relative values of
    currencies may, in some instances, have a significant effect on
    our results of operations.

Many of our products have significant plastic resin content. We
    also use quantities of other commodities, such as aluminum.
    Increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the
    costs of our products and services. We may not be able to pass
    on these costs to our customers, particularly with respect to
    those products we sell pursuant to group purchase agreements,
    and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations and cash flows.



Increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial
    health of our customers and suppliers and thus adversely affect
    their ability to buy our products and supply the components or
    raw materials we need, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

Our strategic initiatives may not produce the intended
    growth in revenue and operating income.

Our strategies include making significant investments to achieve
    revenue growth and margin improvement targets. If we do not
    achieve the expected benefits from these investments or
    otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives, we may
    not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our
    results of operations may be adversely affected.

In addition, as part of our strategy for growth, we have made,
    and may continue to make, acquisitions and divestitures and
    enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint
    development agreements. However, we may not be able to identify
    suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or
    integrate acquisitions successfully, and our strategic alliances
    may not prove to be successful. In this regard, acquisitions
    involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the
    integration of the operations, technologies, services and
    products of the acquired companies and the diversion of
    management’s attention from other business concerns.
    Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks
    inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no
    assurance that we will properly ascertain all such risks. In
    addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future
    acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial
    additional indebtedness and other expenses. Future acquisitions
    may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity
    securities. There can be no assurance that difficulties
    encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

We may not be successful in achieving expected operating
    efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense
    reductions, and may experience business disruptions associated
    with announced restructuring, realignment and cost reduction
    activities.

Over the past few years we have announced several restructuring,
    realignment and cost reduction initiatives, including
    significant realignments of our businesses, employee
    terminations and product rationalizations. While we have started
    to realize the efficiencies of these actions, these activities
    may not produce the full efficiency and cost reduction benefits
    we expect. Further, such benefits may be realized later than
    expected, and the ongoing costs of implementing these measures
    may be greater than anticipated. If these measures are not
    successful or sustainable, we may undertake additional
    realignment and cost reduction efforts, which could result in
    future charges. Moreover, our ability to achieve our other
    strategic goals and business plans may be adversely affected and
    we could experience business disruptions with customers and
    elsewhere if our restructuring and realignment efforts prove
    ineffective.

Fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax
    laws may adversely affect our results.

As a company with significant operations outside of the United
    States, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states
    and other jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is
    derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the
    various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we
    operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the
    amount of tax that will become payable in each of the countries,
    states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our
    effective tax rate may, however, be lower or higher than
    experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a
    change in the mix of our profitability from country to country,
    changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws.
    Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective
    tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our
    current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our
    business and results of operations.

In addition, unfavorable results of tax audits and changes in
    tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate, among other
    things, could adversely affect our results of operations and
    cash flows.



Our technology is important to our success, and our
    failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us
    at a competitive disadvantage.

We rely on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret
    laws of the United States and other countries to protect our
    proprietary rights. Although we own numerous U.S. and
    foreign patents and have applied for numerous patent
    applications, we cannot assure you that any pending patent
    applications will issue, or that any patents, issued or pending,
    will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be
    challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties. In
    addition, we rely on confidentiality and non-disclosure
    agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our
    know-how and trade secrets. The steps we have taken may not
    prevent unauthorized use of our technology by unauthorized
    parties or competitors who may copy or otherwise obtain and use
    these products or technology, particularly in foreign countries
    where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully
    as in the United States. There is no guarantee that current and
    former employees, contractors and other parties will not breach
    their confidentiality agreements with us, misappropriate
    proprietary information or copy or otherwise obtain and use our
    information and proprietary technology without authorization or
    otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights.
    Moreover, there can be no assurance that others will not
    independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or develop
    better technology than our own, which could reduce or eliminate
    any competitive advantage we have developed. Our inability to
    protect our proprietary technology could result in competitive
    harm that could adversely affect our business.

Our products or processes may infringe the intellectual
    property rights of others, which may cause us to pay unexpected
    litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our
    products.

We cannot be certain that our products do not and will not
    infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of
    third parties. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims
    in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of
    alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of
    third parties. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious,
    could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our
    personnel. If we are found liable for infringement, we may be
    required to enter into licensing agreements (which may not be
    available on acceptable terms or at all) or to pay damages and
    to cease making or selling certain products. We may need to
    redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future
    infringement liability. Any of the foregoing could be
    detrimental to our business.

Other pending and future litigation may lead us to incur
    significant costs and have an adverse effect on our
    business.

We also are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the
    normal course of business involving contracts, intellectual
    property, import and export regulations, employment and
    environmental matters. The defense of these lawsuits may divert
    our management’s attention, and we may incur significant
    expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be
    required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject
    to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations. While we do not believe that any litigation in
    which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse
    effect, the outcome of litigation, including regulatory matters,
    is often difficult to predict, and we cannot assure that the
    outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
    of operations.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material
    environmental liabilities, litigation and violations.

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local
    environmental protection and health and safety laws governing,
    among other things:

•

the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous
    materials;

•

emissions or discharges of substances into the
    environment; and

•

the health and safety of our employees.



These laws and government regulations are complex, change
    frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time.
    We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with
    current or future environmental protection and health and safety
    laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases
    of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our
    estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition
    and results of operations. Moreover, we may become subject to
    additional environmental claims, which may include claims for
    personal injury or cleanup, based on our past, present or future
    business activities, which could also adversely affect our
    financial condition and results of operations.

Our Aerospace Segment is subject to government regulation,
    which may require us to incur expenses to ensure compliance. Our
    failure to comply with those regulations could have adverse
    effect on our results of operations.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (the
    “FAA”) regulates the manufacture and sale of some of
    our aerospace products and licenses for the operation of our
    repair stations. Comparable agencies, such as the European
    Aviation Safety Agency in Europe (the “EASA”),
    regulate these matters in other countries. If we fail to qualify
    for or obtain a required license for one of our products or
    services or lose a qualification or license previously granted,
    the sale of the subject product or service would be prohibited
    by law until such license is obtained or renewed and our
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially adversely affected. In addition, designing new
    products to meet existing regulatory requirements and
    retrofitting installed products to comply with new regulatory
    requirements can be expensive and time consuming.

From time to time, the FAA, the EASA or comparable agencies
    propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations.
    These changes or new regulations generally increase the costs of
    compliance. To the extent the FAA, the EASA or comparable
    agencies implement regulatory changes, we may incur significant
    additional costs to achieve compliance.

If we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective
    internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial
    statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which would
    adversely affect our consolidated results, and our ability to
    operate our business and our stock price.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles in the United States.

Any failure on our part to remedy any identified control
    deficiencies, or any delays or errors in our financial
    reporting, would have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations, or financial condition.

Our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar
    agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of
    products and services.

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, approximately
    15% of our net revenues were generated by operations for which a
    significant part of our workforce is covered by collective
    bargaining agreements and similar agreements in foreign
    jurisdictions. It is likely that a portion of our workforce will
    remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements
    for the foreseeable future. Strikes or work stoppages could
    occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our
    customers and our ability to conduct our business.

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our
    business, financial condition or results of operations.

As of December 31, 2010, we had total consolidated
    indebtedness of $917.1 million.



Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we
    may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in
    respect of our indebtedness. It could also have significant
    effects on our business. For example, it could:

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and
    industry conditions;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
    from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby
    reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working
    capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts
    and other general corporate purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes
    in our business and the industries in which we operate;

•

restrict us from exploiting business opportunities;

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our
    competitors that have less indebtedness; and

•

limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working
    capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service
    requirements, execution of our business strategy or other
    general corporate purposes.

Despite current substantial indebtedness levels, we and
    our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more
    indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks associated
    with our substantial leverage.

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial
    additional indebtedness in the future, including secured
    indebtedness. For example, as of December, 31 2010, after taking
    into account the limitations under the covenants under our
    senior credit agreement and our outstanding senior notes issued
    in 2004, which we refer to as the “Senior Notes,” we
    would have had approximately $422.2 million borrowing
    capacity, consisting of $396.3 million of aggregate
    borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and
    $25.9 million of borrowing capacity under our accounts
    receivable securitization facility. Adding new indebtedness to
    current debt levels could make it more difficult for us to
    satisfy our existing debt obligations.

Our indebtedness may restrict our current and future
    operations, which could adversely affect our ability to respond
    to changes in our business and to manage our operations.

Our senior credit agreement and the Senior Notes contain
    financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability
    to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best
    interests such as incur debt, create liens, consolidate, merge
    or dispose of certain assets, make certain investments and
    engage in certain acquisitions. Our failure to comply with those
    covenants could result in an event of default which, if not
    cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our
    debts.

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service
    all of our indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash depends on
    many factors beyond our control. We may be forced to take other
    actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which
    may not be successful.

Our ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our
    indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures, research
    and development efforts, working capital, acquisitions and other
    general corporate purposes depends on our ability to generate
    cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to
    general economic, financial, competitive, legislative,
    regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our
    control. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from
    operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an
    amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund our
    liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

•

refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the
    maturity thereof;

•

sell assets;



•

reduce or delay capital expenditures; or

•

seek to raise additional capital.

In addition, we may not be able to affect any of these actions
    on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to
    refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial
    condition at the time, the restrictions in the instruments
    governing our indebtedness and other factors, including market
    conditions.

Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our
    debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our
    obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would
    have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations, as well
    as our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of the
    notes.

We are a holding company. Substantially all of our
    business is conducted through our subsidiaries. Our ability to
    repay our debt depends on the performance of our subsidiaries
    and their ability to make distributions to us.

We are a holding company. Substantially all of our business is
    conducted through our subsidiaries, which are separate and
    distinct legal entities. Therefore, our ability to service our
    indebtedness is dependent on the earnings and the distribution
    of funds (whether by dividend, distribution or loan) from our
    subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries is obligated to make
    funds available to us for payment on our existing debt. We
    cannot assure you that the agreements governing the existing and
    future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit our
    subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends,
    distributions or loans to fund payments on our existing debt. In
    addition, any payment of dividends, distributions or loans to us
    by our subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on
    dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law
    and monetary transfer restrictions in the jurisdictions in which
    our subsidiaries operate. Furthermore, payments to us by our
    subsidiaries will be contingent upon our subsidiaries’
    earnings.

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of
    any of our subsidiaries, such subsidiaries will pay the holders
    of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able
    to distribute any of their assets to us.

We may not pay dividends on our common stock in the
    future.

Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive
    dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds
    legally available for such payments. The declaration and payment
    of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at
    the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon
    many factors, including our financial condition, earnings,
    compliance with debt instruments, legal requirements and other
    factors as our board of directors deems relevant. We cannot
    assure you that our cash dividend will not be reduced, or
    eliminated, in the future.

The contingent conversion features of our convertible
    notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial
    condition.

In August 2010, we issued $400 million in aggregate
    principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due
    2017, which we refer to as the “Convertible Notes.”
    The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common
    stock beginning on May 1, 2017, or earlier upon the
    satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the Convertible
    Note terms. See “Convertible Notes” under Note 9 to
    our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

for a further discussion regarding the conversion terms of the
    Convertible Notes. If the Convertible Notes become eligible for
    conversion and one or more holders elect to convert their notes,
    unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by
    delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in
    lieu of any fractional shares), we would be required to settle a
    portion of or all of our conversion obligation through the
    payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In
    addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their
    Convertible Notes, if the method of settlement effective during
    the period reflected in the financial statements is cash
    settlement or combination settlement, we would



be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all
    of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a
    current rather than long-term liability in such financial
    statements, which would result in a material reduction of our
    net working capital.

The convertible note hedge transactions and warrant
    transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our
    Convertible Notes may affect the value of our common
    stock.

In connection with our issuance of the Convertible Notes, we
    entered into privately negotiated hedge transactions with third
    parties, which we refer to as the hedge counterparties. The
    hedge transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution
    adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock that
    underlie the Convertible Notes and are expected to reduce our
    exposure to potential dilution with respect to our common stock

and/or

reduce our exposure to potential cash payments that may be
    required to be made by us upon conversion of the Convertible
    Notes. Separately, we also entered into privately negotiated
    warrant transactions relating to the same number of shares of
    our common stock with the hedge counterparties with a strike
    price of $74.648, subject to customary anti-dilution
    adjustments, pursuant to which we may be obligated to issue
    shares of our common stock. The warrant transactions could have
    a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock or, if we so
    elect, obligate us to make cash payments to the extent that the
    market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike
    price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants.

In connection with establishing its initial hedges of the
    convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant
    transactions, the hedge counterparties (and/or their affiliates)
    entered into various cash-settled

over-the-counter

derivative transactions with respect to our common stock
    concurrently with, or shortly following, the pricing of the
    Convertible Notes. The hedge counterparties (and/or their
    affiliates) may, in their sole discretion, with or without
    notice, modify their hedge positions from time to time (and are
    likely to do so during any conversion period related to the
    conversion of the Convertible Notes) by entering into or
    unwinding various

over-the-counter

derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common
    stock,

and/or

by
    purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or Convertible
    Notes in privately negotiated transactions

and/or

open
    market transactions. The effect, if any, of these transactions
    and activities on the market price of our common stock will
    depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at
    this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect
    the value of our common stock.

We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the
    convertible note hedge transactions.

Each hedge counterparty is a financial institution or the
    affiliate of a financial institution, and we will be subject to
    the risk that one or more hedge counterparties may default under
    the Convertible Note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the
    credit risk of each hedge counterparty will not be secured by
    any collateral. Recent global economic conditions have resulted
    in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of
    many financial institutions, including a bankruptcy filing by
    Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and its various affiliates. If a
    hedge counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we
    will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a
    claim equal to our exposure at that time under the Convertible
    Note hedge transaction with that hedge counterparty. Our
    exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the
    increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in
    our stock market price and in volatility of our common stock. In
    addition, upon a default by a hedge counterparty, we may suffer
    adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common
    stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial
    stability or viability of the hedge counterparties.

We may issue additional shares of our common stock or
    instruments convertible into our common stock, including in
    connection with conversions of our Convertible Notes, which
    could lower the price of our common stock.

We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our
    common stock or other instruments convertible into our common
    stock. As of December 31, 2010, we had outstanding
    approximately 40.0 million shares of our common stock,
    options to purchase approximately 2.3 million shares of our
    common stock (of which approximately 1.5 million were
    vested as of that date), approximately 0.4 million of
    restricted stock awards



(which are expected to vest over the next three years) and
    approximately 30,000 shares of our common stock to be
    distributed from our deferred compensation plan. In addition, a
    substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for
    issuance upon the exercise of stock options, upon conversion of
    the Convertible Notes and upon the exercise of the warrants
    issued in connection with the Convertible Notes. We cannot
    predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that
    they may have on the market price for our common stock.

If we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments
    convertible into our common stock, it may materially and
    adversely affect the price of our common stock. Furthermore, the
    conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes may dilute
    the ownership interests of existing stockholders, and any sales
    in the public market of such shares of our common stock issuable
    upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes could adversely
    affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In
    addition, the anticipated issuance and sale of substantial
    amounts of common stock or conversion of the Convertible Notes
    into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our
    common stock.

Certain provisions of our corporate governing documents
    and Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or
    acquisition.

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could
    impede a merger, takeover or other business combination
    involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a
    tender offer for our common stock. For example, our certificate
    of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine
    the number of shares in a series, the consideration, dividend
    rights, liquidation preferences, terms of redemption, conversion
    or exchange rights and voting rights, if any, of unissued series
    of preferred stock, without any vote or action by our
    stockholders. Thus, our board of directors can authorize and
    issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights
    that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of
    holders of our common stock. We are also subject to
    Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which
    imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations
    between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock.
    These provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring
    a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in
    the best interest of our stockholders, and accordingly could
    reduce the market price of our common stock.

Certain provisions in our Convertible Notes could delay or
    prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of
    us.

Certain provisions in the Convertible Notes and the indenture
    governing the Convertible Notes could make it more difficult or
    more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if
    an acquisition event constitutes a fundamental change, holders
    of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to
    purchase their notes in cash. In addition, if an acquisition
    event constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, we may be
    required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert
    their notes in connection with such acquisition event. In either
    case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Convertible
    Notes and the indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us
    or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or
    removing incumbent management, and accordingly could reduce the
    market price of our common stock.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

On October 11, 2007, the Company’s subsidiary, Arrow
    International, Inc. (“Arrow”), received a corporate
    warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
    (FDA). The letter expressed concerns with Arrow’s quality
    systems, including complaint handling, corrective and preventive
    action, process and design validation, inspection and training
    procedures. It also advised that Arrow’s corporate-wide
    program to evaluate, correct and prevent quality system issues
    had been deficient.

The Company developed and implemented a comprehensive plan to
    correct the issues raised in the letter and further improve
    overall quality systems. From the end of 2009 to the beginning
    of 2010, the FDA reinspected the Arrow facilities covered by the
    corporate warning letter, and Arrow has responded to the
    observations issued by the FDA as a result of those inspections.
    Communications received from the FDA indicate



that the FDA has classified its inspection observations as
    “voluntary action indicated,” or VAI. This
    classification signifies that the FDA has concluded that no
    further regulatory action is required, and that any observations
    made during the inspections can be addressed voluntarily by the
    Company. In addition, in the third quarter of 2010, Arrow
    submitted and received FDA approval of all currently eligible
    requests for certificates to foreign governments, or CFGs. The
    Company believes that the FDA’s approval of its CFG
    requests is a clear indication that Arrow has substantially
    corrected the quality system issues identified in the corporate
    warning letter. The Company is continuing to work with the FDA
    to resolve all remaining issues and obtain formal closure of the
    corporate warning letter.

While the Company continues to believe it has substantially
    remediated the issues raised in the corporate warning letter
    through the corrective actions taken to date, the corporate
    warning letter remains in place pending final resolution of all
    outstanding issues, which the Company is actively working with
    the FDA to resolve. If the Company’s remedial actions are
    not satisfactory to the FDA, the Company may have to devote
    additional financial and human resources to its efforts, and the
    FDA may take further regulatory actions against the Company.

In addition, we are a party to various lawsuits and claims
    arising in the normal course of business. These lawsuits and
    claims include actions involving product liability, intellectual
    property, employment and environmental matters. Based on
    information currently available, advice of counsel, established
    reserves and other resources, we do not believe that any such
    actions are likely to be, individually or in the aggregate,
    material to our business, financial condition, results of
    operations or liquidity. However, in the event of unexpected
    further developments, it is possible that the ultimate
    resolution of these matters, or other similar matters, if
    unfavorable, may be materially adverse to our business,
    financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

The terms of our senior credit facility and senior notes issued
    in 2004 provide for the maintenance of specified financial
    ratios and limit the repurchase of our stock and payment of cash
    dividends. Under the most restrictive of these provisions, on an
    annual basis $285 million of retained earnings was
    available for dividends and stock repurchases at
    December 31, 2010. On February 23, 2011, the Board of
    Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share on
    our common stock, which is payable on March 15, 2011 to
    holders of record on March 4, 2011. As of February 23,
    2011, we had approximately 761 holders of record of our
    common stock.

On June 14, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $300 million of our outstanding common
    stock. Through December 31, 2010, no shares have been
    purchased under this Board authorization. See “Stock
    Repurchase Programs” contained in the Management Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations” for more information.

    MidCap 400 Index because, due to the traditionally diverse
    nature of our businesses, we did not believe that there existed
    a relevant published industry or

index, and we did not believe we could reasonably identify a
    peer group. However, as we are now principally a provider of
    medical technology products, we have decided that the S&P
    500 Healthcare Equipment & Supply Index is a more
    appropriate benchmark against which to measure our stock
    performance. In accordance with SEC regulations, the graph below
    references both the S&P MidCap 400 Index and the S&P
    500 Healthcare Equipment & Supply Index. The annual
    changes for the five-year period shown on the graph are based on
    the assumption that $100 had been invested in Teleflex common
    stock and each index on December 31, 2005 and that all
    dividends were reinvested.

Free cash flow is calculated by reducing cash provided by
    operating activities from continuing operations by capital
    expenditures. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial
    measure. We use this financial measure for internal managerial
    purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future
    results, and to evaluate

period-to-period

comparisons. This financial measure is used in addition to and
    in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP
    and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial
    measures. Management believes that free cash flow is a useful
    measure to investors because it facilitates an assessment of
    funds available to satisfy current and future obligations, pay
    dividends and fund acquisitions. Free cash flow is not a measure
    of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have
    certain non-discretionary obligations, such as debt service,
    that are not deducted from the measure. Management strongly
    encourages investors to review our financial statements and
    publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any
    single financial measure. The following is a reconciliation of
    free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure as required
    under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Overview

We are a leading global provider of medical technology products
    that enable healthcare providers to improve patient outcomes,
    reduce infections and enhance patient and provider safety. We
    primarily develop, manufacture and supply single-use medical
    devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common
    diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and
    surgical applications. We serve hospitals and healthcare
    providers in more than 130 countries and are not dependent upon
    any one end-market or procedure.

We are focused on achieving consistent, sustainable and
    profitable growth through:

•

the introduction of new products and product line extensions;

•

expanding our geographic reach;

•

leveraging our existing distribution channels;

•

further investment in global sales and marketing; and

•

select acquisitions which enhance or expedite our development
    initiatives and our ability to increase our market share.

Furthermore, we believe our research and development
    capabilities and our commitment to engineering excellence and
    lean, low-cost manufacturing allow us to consistently bring cost
    effective, innovative products to market that improve the
    safety, efficacy, and quality of healthcare. We provide a
    broad-based platform of medical products, which we categorize
    into four groups: Critical Care, Surgical Care, Cardiac Care and
    OEM and Development Services.

We have employed a disciplined portfolio management strategy to
    transform Teleflex into primarily a medical technology company.
    We expect to continue to increase the relative composition of
    our Medical Segment through a combination of portfolio
    management and organic growth initiatives. We may seek
    acquisition opportunities that augment our existing medical
    technology platform and disposition opportunities that enable us
    to further our transformation into a pure-play medical
    technology company. Furthermore, our commitment to becoming a
    pure-play global medical technology company involves investing
    in our medical research and development and sales and marketing
    initiatives to further expand and strengthen our portfolio of
    products as well as our ability to penetrate existing and new
    geographic and therapeutic markets.

While we are committed to becoming a pure-play medical
    technology company, we continue to have businesses that serve
    other non-medical niche segments of the aerospace and commercial
    markets with specialty engineered products. We expect to
    strategically divest our non-core Aerospace and Commercial
    Segments over time. Our aerospace products include
    cargo-handling systems, containers, and pallets for commercial
    air cargo. Our commercial products include driver controls,
    engine assemblies and drive parts for the marine industry.



Our leading brands include:

Over the past several years, we significantly changed the
    composition of our portfolio through acquisitions, principally
    in our Medical Segment, and divestitures in both our Aerospace
    and Commercial segments. These portfolio actions resulted in a
    significant expansion of our Medical Segment operations and a
    significant reduction in our Aerospace and Commercial Segment
    operations. As a result, our Medical Segment now accounts for
    approximately 80% of our revenues from continuing operations and
    over 85% of our segment operating profit.

Below is a listing of our more significant acquisitions and
    divestitures that have occurred since 2007. The results for the
    acquired businesses are included in their respective segments.

    $93.4 million, net of tax.

Health Care
    Reform

On March 23, 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable
    Care Act was signed into law. While providing some clarity on
    the impact of reform to our industry, this legislation will
    nevertheless have a significant impact on our business. For
    medical device companies such as Teleflex, the expansion of
    medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of
    the products we manufacture, but this legislation also contains
    provisions designed to contain the cost of healthcare, which
    could negatively affect pricing of our products. In addition,
    commencing in 2013, the legislation imposes a 2.3% excise tax on
    sales of medical devices. As this new law is implemented over
    the next 2-3 years, we will be in a better position to
    ascertain its impact on our business. We currently estimate the
    impact of the medical device excise tax will be approximately
    $16 million annually, beginning in 2013. Also in the first
    quarter of 2010, we evaluated the change in the tax regulations
    related to the Medicare Part D subsidy as currently
    outlined in the new legislation and determined that it did not
    have a significant impact on our financial position or results
    of operations.

Global Economic
    Conditions

Global recessionary conditions during 2009 and 2008 had adverse
    impacts on market activities including, among other things,
    failure of financial institutions, falling asset values,
    diminished liquidity, and reduced demand for products and
    services of the past few years. For Teleflex, these economic
    developments principally affected our Aerospace and Commercial
    Segments and in response, we adjusted production levels and
    engaged in new restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of
    2008 and in the first half of 2009. Although, on a consolidated
    basis, the economic conditions did not have a significant
    adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations
    or liquidity during 2010 and 2009, the continuation of the
    present broad economic trends of weak economic growth,
    constricted credit and public sector austerity measures in
    response to growing public budget deficits could adversely
    affect our operations in the future, as described below. The
    potential effect of these factors on our current and future
    liquidity is discussed below under “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources” in this “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

•

Medical

—

Our Medical Segment
    serves a diverse base of hospitals and healthcare providers in
    more than 130 countries. Healthcare policies and practice trends
    vary by country, and the impact of the



global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of
    our regional markets during 2010 and 2009.

Hospitals in some regions of the United States experienced a
    decline in admissions, a weaker payor mix, and a reduction in
    elective procedures. Hospitals consequently took actions to
    reduce their costs, including limiting their capital spending.
    Distributors in the supply chain reduced inventory levels during
    2009 and generally did not replenish inventories to
    pre-recession levels during 2010. The impact of these actions
    was most pronounced in capital goods markets, which affected our
    surgical instrument and cardiac assist businesses. Our
    orthopedic OEM business was impacted in 2009 by delayed new
    product launches by our OEM customers. This has improved
    somewhat during 2010, but has not returned to pre-recession
    levels. Approximately 90 percent of our Medical revenues
    come from disposable products used in critical care and surgical
    applications, and our sales volume could be negatively impacted
    if hospital admission rates or payor mix decline further as a
    result of continuing high unemployment rates (and subsequent
    loss of insurance coverage by consumers).

In Europe, some countries have taken austerity measures due to
    the current economic climate. Elective surgeries have been
    delayed and hospital budgets have been reduced. In certain
    countries (mainly Germany) we have seen changes in the local
    reimbursement to home care patients and pricing impacts on
    business awarded through the tendering process. These markets
    have introduced more buying groups and GPO’s driving
    commodity product pricing downwards. It is possible that funding
    for publically funded healthcare institutions could be affected
    in the future as governments make further spending adjustments
    and enact healthcare reform measures to lower overall healthcare
    costs. During 2010, the public healthcare systems in certain
    countries in Western Europe, most notably Greece, Spain,
    Portugal and Italy, have experienced reduced liquidity due to
    recessionary conditions, which has resulted in a slow down in
    payments to us. We believe this situation will continue unless
    and until these countries are able to find alternative funding
    sources to their respective public healthcare sectors. In 2010,
    sales into the public hospital systems in these countries were
    approximately 4% of our total sales.

In Asia, recovery from the global recession varies by country.
    China has announced plans for major healthcare investment
    targeted at second tier cities/hospitals, which may provide
    future growth opportunities for us, while slow economic growth
    and continued pursuit of reimbursement cuts by the public
    hospital sector in Japan will limit growth in that market.

•

Aerospace —

Sudden and significant
    increases in fuel costs in mid-2008 resulted in reductions in
    capacity for passenger and cargo traffic, and accelerated
    retirement of older, less fuel efficient aircraft. However, 2009
    operating results improved somewhat as the sharp drop in fuel
    costs toward the end of 2008 partially offset the recession
    related drop in revenues for both passenger and cargo traffic
    due to the economic crisis in 2009. The lower traffic reduced
    demand and made it more difficult to sell cargo containment
    equipment, but new aircraft production and weight and greenhouse
    gas reduction objectives have created some opportunities in
    these markets. In 2010, conditions in the commercial aviation
    markets improved, and we believe we are well positioned on
    certain new Airbus and Boeing airframes, and we expect
    deliveries of cargo handling systems to continue at previously
    expected levels overall, albeit over a slightly longer time
    horizon than what we initially anticipated.

•

Commercial —

The markets served by our
    Commercial Segment are largely affected by the general state of
    the economy and by consumer confidence. Factors such as housing
    starts, home values, fuel costs, environmental and other
    regulatory matters all affect the market outlook for the
    businesses in this segment. Very high fuel prices in 2008 began
    a trend of declining demand in the recreational marine market
    and the global recession that followed caused this trend to
    continue in 2009 in spite of moderating fuel costs. In 2010,
    although the recreational boating market recovered somewhat



from its depressed levels of 2009, we expect that growth will be
    limited in our Commercial Segment until there is more robust
    global economic growth, the pace of consumer deleveraging slows
    down and consumer confidence improves.

Results of
    Operations

Discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a
    purchased company for up to twelve months beyond the date of
    acquisition. Activity beyond the initial twelve months is
    considered core growth. Core growth excludes the impact of
    translating the results of international subsidiaries at
    different currency exchange rates from year to year and the
    comparable activity of divested companies within the most recent
    twelve-month period.

The following comparisons exclude the impact of the operations
    of the Actuation, Heavy Lift, SSI, ATI and Power Systems
    businesses which have been presented in our consolidated
    financial results as discontinued operations (see Note 18
    to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

and “Discontinued Operations” in this
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” for discussion of
    discontinued operations).

Revenues

Net revenues

$

Net revenues increased approximately 2% to $1.80 billion in
    2010 from $1.77 billion in 2009. Core growth was 3%, which
    was partially offset by the 1% decline in revenue attributed to
    the disposition of a product line in the Commercial Segment
    during the first quarter of 2009 and the deconsolidation of a
    variable interest entity in our Medical Segment in the first
    quarter of 2010 due to the adoption of new accounting guidance.
    Core revenues were 7% higher in the Aerospace Segment due to
    improving conditions in commercial aviation markets, and 16%
    higher in the Commercial Segment as recreational boating markets
    recover from the depressed levels of 2009. Core revenues in the
    Medical Segment were 1% higher than 2009 as the negative impact
    of a voluntary recall of a product in our critical care product
    group and lower sales of orthopedic devices sold to medical
    original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, was more than offset
    by higher sales of other critical care and surgical products.

Net revenues decreased approximately 8% to $1.77 billion in
    2009 from $1.91 billion in 2008. A reduction in core
    revenues caused 5% of the decline while foreign currency
    movements caused the other 3% of the decline. As a result of 2%
    core growth in the fourth quarter in the Medical Segment, core
    revenue in that segment was flat in 2009 compared to 2008, but
    core revenue declined in the Aerospace and Commercial segments
    by 23% and 15%, respectively in 2009 compared to 2008. Weak
    global economic conditions negatively impacted markets served by
    our Aerospace and Commercial segments throughout 2009.

Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 44.1% in
    2010 from 43.7% in 2009. Gross profit as a percentage of
    revenues increased in each of our three segments compared to the
    corresponding periods of 2009, with the most pronounced increase
    in the Aerospace Segment as a result of core growth,
    manufacturing efficiencies and a sales mix favoring higher
    margin spare components and repairs.



Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 43.7% in
    2009 from 41.9% in 2008, with all three segments experiencing
    increases in gross profit as a percentage of revenues. The
    principal factors that impact the overall increase were a higher
    percentage of Medical revenues (81% of total revenues in 2009
    compared to 77% in 2008), a $7 million fair value
    adjustment to inventory in the first quarter of 2008 related to
    inventory acquired in the Arrow acquisition, which did not recur
    in 2009, synergies from the Arrow acquisition and manufacturing
    cost reductions implemented in each of our three segments,
    partly offset by higher pension expense in 2009 because of the
    decline in the value of our pension assets at the end of 2008 as
    a result of losses experienced in the global equity markets.

Selling, general and administrative expenses (operating

    compared to 25.7% in 2009. The $21 million increase in
    costs was principally related to $23 million in higher
    costs in the Medical Segment largely due to investments in
    sales, marketing, and clinical education programs of
    approximately $16 million, approximately $10 million
    of costs associated with product recall and remediation
    activities, partially offset by approximately $4 million
    lower spending on remediation of FDA regulatory issues.
    Professional fees incurred in connection with our debt
    refinancing during the third quarter of 2010 of approximately
    $2 million was offset by reductions in the Aerospace and
    Commercial segments and Corporate costs of approximately
    $2 million.

Selling, general and administrative expenses (operating
    expenses) as a percentage of revenues were 25.7% in 2009
    compared to 26.3% in 2008. The reduction in the dollar value of
    these costs was principally the result of cost reduction
    initiatives throughout the Company, including restructuring and
    integration activities in connection with the Arrow acquisition
    and the 2008 Commercial segment restructuring program, and lower
    spending on remediation of FDA regulatory issues. These factors
    resulted in an aggregate reduction in expenses of approximately
    $48 million.

During the second quarter of 2009, we performed an interim

    result of the difficult market conditions confronting the
    reporting unit and the significant deterioration in its
    operating performance, which accelerated in the second quarter
    of 2009. Upon conclusion of this review, we determined that
    goodwill in the Cargo Container operations was impaired, and we
    recorded an impairment charge of $6.7 million in the second
    quarter of 2009.

    lower average interest rates in 2010 compared to 2009,
    reflecting the refinancing transaction that occurred in the
    third quarter of 2010.

Interest expense decreased in 2009 due to an approximate
    $350 million reduction in debt during the year, principally
    reflecting the $240 million of debt repaid in the first
    quarter of 2009 from the proceeds of the sale of the ATI
    business.

Loss on
    extinguishment of debt

In 2010, we recognized losses on the extinguishment of debt of
    $46.6 million as a result of our refinancing transactions
    in the third quarter of 2010 and prepayment of notes in the
    fourth quarter of 2010. In connection with our refinancing
    transactions in the third quarter of 2010, we prepaid our senior
    notes issued in 2007 (the “2007 Notes”) and recognized
    debt extinguishment costs of approximately $28.8 million
    comprised of a prepayment make-whole fee of $28.1 million,
    the write-off of $0.6 million of unamortized debt issuance
    costs incurred prior to the refinancing transactions and related
    legal fees. Also in connection with our refinancing transactions
    in the third quarter of 2010, we prepaid $200 million of
    our senior credit facility and recognized additional losses on
    the extinguishment of debt of $1.6 million related to the
    write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs incurred prior to
    the refinancing transactions. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we
    prepaid our senior notes issued in 2004 (the “2004
    Notes” and, together with 2007 Notes, the “Senior
    Notes”) and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of
    approximately $16.3 million comprised of a prepayment
    make-whole fee of $15.5 million, the write-off of
    $0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs incurred
    prior to the refinancing transactions and related legal fees.

The effective tax rate in 2010 was 14.8% compared to 20.6% in
    2009. Taxes on income from continuing operations in 2010 were
    $21.9 million compared to $35.1 million in 2009. The
    decrease in the effective income tax rate reflects the impact of
    beneficial discrete tax charges and a reduction in reserves for
    uncertain tax positions as audits and settlements were closed
    and fewer new reserves were established.

The effective tax rate in 2009 was 20.6% compared to 31.7% in
    2008. Taxes on income from continuing operations in 2009 were
    $35.1 million compared to $37.9 million in 2008. The
    decrease in the effective tax rate was due to (i) a
    decrease in deferred state tax liabilities resulting from
    changes to applicable state tax laws and (ii) a reduction
    in reserves for uncertain tax positions as audits and
    settlements were closed, and fewer new reserves were established
    than in the prior year.

In December 2008, we began certain restructuring initiatives
    that affect the Commercial Segment. These initiatives involved
    the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in
    workforce at three of our facilities in Europe and North
    America. We implemented these initiatives as a means to address
    expected weaknesses in the marine and industrial markets. By
    December 31, 2009, we completed the 2008 Commercial Segment
    restructuring program and all costs associated with the program
    were fully paid during 2009. Therefore, no charges were recorded
    under this program in 2010.

In connection with the acquisition of Arrow during 2007, we
    formulated a plan related to the integration of Arrow and our
    other Medical businesses. The integration plan focused on the
    closure of Arrow corporate functions and the consolidation of
    manufacturing, sales, marketing, and distribution functions in
    North America, Europe and Asia. Costs related to actions that
    affect employees and facilities of Arrow have been included in
    the allocation of the purchase price of Arrow and are not
    included in these results. Costs related to actions that affect
    employees and facilities of Teleflex are charged to earnings and
    included in restructuring and impairment charges within the
    consolidated statement of operations. These costs amounted to
    approximately $2.9 million during 2010. As of
    December 31, 2010, we expect future restructuring and
    impairment charges that we will incur in connection with the
    Arrow integration plan, if any, will be nominal.

In June 2006, we began certain restructuring initiatives that
    affected all three of our operating segments. These initiatives
    involved the consolidation of operations and a related reduction
    in workforce at several of our facilities in Europe and North
    America. We took these initiatives as a means to improving
    operating performance and to better leverage our existing
    resources and these activities are now complete.

For additional information regarding our restructuring programs,
    see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

During the second quarter of 2009, we recorded $2.3 million
    in impairment charges with respect to an intangible asset in our
    Commercial Segment. During the third quarter of 2009, based on
    continued deterioration in the California real estate market, we
    recorded $3.3 million in impairment charges to fully
    write-off an investment in a real estate venture in California.
    We initially invested in the venture in 2004 by contributing
    property and other assets that had been part of one of its
    former manufacturing sites.

Impairment charges in 2008 included $2.7 million related to
    five of our minority held investments precipitated by the
    deteriorating economic conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008,
    $5.2 million related to Medical Segment facilities that
    were reclassified to held for sale in the fourth quarter of
    2008, $1.5 million related to facilities in the Commercial
    Segment involved in the 2008 Commercial Segment restructuring
    program, $0.8 million related to an intangible asset in the
    Commercial Segment that was identified during the annual
    impairment testing process, and a $0.2 million reduction in
    the carrying value of a building held for sale.

Medical

Comparison
    of 2010 and 2009

Medical Segment net revenues for 2010 of $1,433.3 million
    were essentially unchanged from the $1,434.9 million
    reported in the same period last year, as core growth of 1% was
    offset by the impact of the deconsolidation of a variable
    interest entity (1%). The increase in core revenue was
    predominantly in the European and Asia/Latin American critical
    care product groups and OEM specialty sutures and other devices,
    offset by declines in OEM orthopedic implant products and in
    North American surgical products



Net revenues for 2010, 2009 and 2008 by product group for the

    guidance. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial
    statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for information on the new accounting guidance.

Critical
    Care

Critical care revenues in 2010 were negatively impacted
    approximately $17 million when compared to 2009 due to the
    recall of our custom IV tubing product during the first
    quarter of 2010, which contributed to a decline in vascular
    access sales. This decline was offset by higher sales of other
    vascular access and urology products in North America and
    Europe, anesthesia products (in Europe, North America and
    Asia/Latin America) and respiratory products in North America
    and Asia/Latin America compared with the prior year.

Surgical
    Care

Surgical core revenue increased 1% in 2010 compared to 2009,
    primarily due to higher ligation sales in Asia/Latin America and
    Europe, partially offset by lower sales of general instrument
    and closure devices in North America.

Cardiac
    Care

Sales of cardiac care products in 2010 compared to 2009 were
    affected positively by higher sales of intra aortic balloon
    pumps and catheters, primarily in European markets, offset by an
    approximate $3 million impact from the recall of certain
    intra-aortic balloon catheters during the fourth quarter of 2010.

Original
    Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) and Development
    Services

Sales of devices to OEMs increased approximately
    $4.4 million in 2010 compared to 2009. Core revenue to OEMs
    increased 4% in 2010 compared with 2009. This increase is
    largely attributable to higher sales of specialty suture and
    catheter fabrication products, partially offset by lower sales
    of orthopedic implant products and forged instruments due to
    customer inventory rebalancing and a reduction in new product
    launches by OEM customers.

Medical Segment operating profit decreased 9% in 2010 from
    $302.6 million in 2009 to $276.1 million in 2010.
    Operating results for 2010 were negatively impacted by
    approximately $22 million in costs associated with the
    recall and remediation of our custom IV tubing product and
    certain intra-aortic balloon catheters and a factory shut down
    associated with the custom IV tubing product, approximately
    $4 million for other product remediation activities,
    approximately $6 million in higher research and development
    costs, and approximately $16 million in higher costs for
    sales, marketing, and clinical education programs. These factors
    more than offset the positive contribution of approximately
    $17 million from higher sales volumes of products not
    affected by



the impact of product recalls, approximately $5 million
    lower manufacturing costs as a result of cost reduction
    initiatives and approximately $4 million lower expenses
    related to the remediation of FDA regulatory issues.

Comparison
    of 2009 and 2008

Medical Segment net revenues declined 3% in 2009 to
    $1,434.9 million, from $1,475.6 million in 2008,
    entirely due to foreign currency fluctuations, mainly the
    stronger U.S. dollar against the Euro during the first
    three quarters of 2009. In the aggregate, we experienced no
    growth in core revenue in 2009 over 2008, as growth in critical
    care products in Europe and Asia/Latin America of approximately
    $11 million was offset by approximately $9 million
    lower sales of orthopedic instrumentation products to OEMs in
    North America and approximately $8 million lower sales of
    surgical products in North America and Europe.

Critical
    Care

The decrease in critical care product sales during 2009 compared
    to 2008 was entirely due to currency fluctuations as core
    revenue in this product group increased approximately 1% in
    2009. Higher sales of vascular access, urology and anesthesia
    products of approximately $12 million were partially offset
    by approximately $6 million lower sales of respiratory
    products, principally as a result of distributor de-stocking in
    North America in early 2009.

Surgical
    Care

Surgical product sales declined approximately 4% in 2009
    compared to 2008. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted
    sales by approximately 3%, and lower sales in the
    instrumentation product line in Europe and North America led the
    1% decline in core revenue. We believe this decline in sales
    resulted from hospitals limiting their capital budgets for these
    products and distributors reducing inventory in the supply chain.

Cardiac
    Care

The decrease in sales of cardiac care products in 2009 compared
    to 2008 is mainly due to currency movements, hospital capital
    budget constraints and a voluntary product recall during the
    first quarter of 2009.

OEM and
    Development Services

Sales of devices to OEMs decreased primarily as a result of
    approximately $9 million lower sales of orthopedic
    instrumentation as higher sales of specialty sutures and other
    devices of approximately $2 million was offset by the
    impact of currency movements. A reduction in new product
    launches by OEM customers and overall weakness in OEM orthopedic
    markets due to hospital budgetary constraints and postponement
    of certain elective surgical procedures have had a negative
    impact on demand for our orthopedic instrumentation products.

Operating profit in the Medical Segment increased 7% in 2009 to
    $302.6 million, from $283.0 million in 2008. The
    negative impact on operating profit from a stronger
    U.S. dollar during the first three quarters of 2009 was
    more than offset by approximately $20 million of lower
    manufacturing and selling, general and administrative costs
    during 2009 as a result of cost reduction initiatives, including
    restructuring and integration activities in connection with the
    Arrow acquisition, and approximately $18 million lower
    expenses related to the remediation of FDA regulatory issues.
    Also, a $7 million expense for fair value adjustment to
    inventory in the first quarter of 2008 related to inventory
    acquired in the Arrow acquisition, which did not recur in 2009,
    had a favorable impact on the comparison of 2009 operating
    profit to the prior year.



Aerospace

Comparison
    of 2010 and 2009

Aerospace Segment net revenues increased 6% in 2010 to
    $173.5 million, from $163.3 million in 2009. During
    2010, core revenue increased 7%, while currency movements
    decreased sales by 1%. The core growth is due principally to
    improvement in the commercial aviation market, particularly in
    the second half of 2010, which led to higher sales of wide-body
    cargo handling systems, cargo system spare components and
    repairs and cargo containers.

Segment operating profit increased 134% in 2010 to
    $22.5 million, compared to $9.6 million in 2009. The
    higher operating profit in 2010 compared to the same period of
    2009 was primarily due to approximately $4 million in
    higher sales volumes, approximately $3 million resulting
    from a favorable sales mix of higher margin cargo system spare
    components and repairs, and approximately $3 million in
    manufacturing efficiencies achieved in the production of cargo
    containers and wide-body cargo handling systems for aircraft
    manufacturers.

Comparison
    of 2009 and 2008

Aerospace Segment net revenues declined 27% in 2009 to
    $163.3 million, from $224.1 million in 2008. Core
    revenue reductions accounted for nearly all (23%) of the decline
    in revenue. Weakness in the commercial aviation sector
    throughout 2009 resulted in reduced sales to commercial airlines
    and freight carriers of wide body cargo spare components and
    repairs and cargo containers. This market weakness has also
    reduced the number of aftermarket cargo system conversions,
    resulting in lower sales of multi-deck wide body cargo handling
    systems, which offset the impact of higher sales of single deck
    wide body systems on passenger aircraft.

Segment operating profit decreased 41% in 2009 to
    $9.6 million, from $16.3 million in 2008. This decline
    was principally due to the sharply lower sales volumes across
    all product lines, including the unfavorable mix in 2009 of
    lower margin single deck system sales compared with a mix in
    2008 that was weighted more toward aftermarket multi-deck system
    conversions and spares and repairs. The impact from lower sales
    volumes was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives that
    resulted in operating cost reductions of approximately
    $9 million during 2009.

Commercial

Comparison
    of 2010 and 2009

Commercial Segment net revenues increased approximately 16% in
    2010 to $194.9 million, from $168.1 million in 2009.
    Core growth of 16% and favorable currency movements of 1% were
    partially offset by the impact from the divestiture of a marine
    product line in the first quarter of 2009 (1%). Higher sales of
    marine products to OEM manufacturers for the recreational boat
    market and spare parts in the marine aftermarket accounted for
    20% of sales growth while lower sales of industrial non-marine
    products negatively impacted sales growth by 4%.

Commercial Segment operating income increased 67% to
    $18.0 million, compared to $10.8 million for the same
    period last year. This increase principally was due to
    approximately $6 million in higher sales volumes of marine
    products to OEM manufacturers for the recreational boat market
    and spare parts in the marine aftermarket, as well as a
    reduction in factory costs of approximately $4 million
    resulting from facility consolidations in 2009, partially offset
    by the stronger Canadian dollar, which resulted in a negative
    impact on our costs of approximately $3 million.



Comparison
    of 2009 and 2008

Commercial Segment net revenues declined by approximately 21% in
    2009 to $168.1 million, from $212.4 million in 2008.
    Core revenue reductions accounted for 15% of the decline, which
    was principally the result of a decrease in sales of marine
    products to OEM manufacturers for the recreational boat market
    (22%), partially offset by approximately $20 million of
    higher sales of the modern burner unit to the U.S. Military.

In 2009, segment operating profit decreased 21% to
    $10.8 million compared to $13.7 million in 2008. This
    decrease was principally due to the lower sales volumes of
    marine products to OEM manufacturers for the recreational boat
    market, which more than offset the impact from the elimination
    of approximately $8 million of operating costs in 2009 and
    higher sales of the modern burner unit to the U.S. military.

Liquidity and
    Capital Resources

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash
    to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our
    principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. In
    addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that
    affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital
    expenditures, acquisitions, pension funding, dividends, common
    stock repurchases, adequacy of available bank lines of credit,
    and access to other capital markets.

We currently do not foresee any difficulties in meeting our cash
    requirements or accessing credit as needed in the next twelve
    months. To date, we have not experienced an inordinate amount of
    payment defaults by our customers, and we have sufficient
    lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our
    anticipated additional operating needs. However, in light of
    global economic conditions over the past few years, there is a
    risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access
    liquidity. If global economic conditions deteriorate, we may
    experience delays in customer payments and reductions in our
    customers’ purchases from us, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our liquidity.

The deterioration in the securities markets that occurred during
    2008 and the subsequent moderate recovery in these markets
    during 2009 and 2010 impacted the market value of the assets
    included in our defined benefit pension plans. As a result of
    these market fluctuations, the market value of assets in our
    domestic pension funds declined in value by approximately
    $76 million during 2008 and recovered approximately
    $65 million through 2010. In September 2010, we made a
    $30 million cash contribution to the Teleflex Retirement
    Income Plan to improve the funded status of the pension plan.
    The volatility in the securities markets has not significantly
    affected the liquidity of our pension plans or counterparty
    exposure. A majority of the assets in our domestic pension plans
    are invested in mutual funds registered with the SEC under the
    Investment Company Act of 1940. Underlying holdings of the
    mutual funds are primarily invested in publicly traded equity
    and fixed income securities.

We manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the
    funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the
    extent to which those funds can be accessed on a cost effective
    basis. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our
    subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, those
    balances are generally available without legal restrictions to
    fund ordinary business operations. We have and will continue to
    transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the U.S. and to
    other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do
    so.

We depend on foreign sources of cash to fund a portion of our
    debt service requirements, substantially all of which relate to
    United States indebtedness because the net cash provided by
    U.S.-based operating activities alone is not sufficient.
    Accordingly, we repatriated approximately $123 million and
    $363 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, of cash from
    our foreign subsidiaries to help fund debt service and other
    cash requirements. These cash distributions are subject to tax
    in the U.S. at the corporate tax rate reduced by applicable
    foreign tax credits for foreign taxes paid on distributed
    earnings. Approximately $62.6 million of our
    $206.6 million of net cash provided by operating activities
    in 2010 was generated in the U.S., and approximately
    $23.5 million of our $172.2 million of net cash
    provided by operating activities in 2009 was generated in the
    U.S.



During 2010 and 2009 we repaid approximately $727 million
    and $359 million, respectively, of debt from the proceeds
    of the issuance of convertible debt, the sale of businesses and
    from cash generated from operations. As a result, we have no
    scheduled principal payments under our senior credit facility
    until October 2012. Our next scheduled senior note principal
    payment is in July 2011 for approximately $73 million. We
    anticipate our domestic interest payments for 2011 will be
    approximately $52 million. To the extent we cannot, or
    choose not to, repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries in time
    to meet quarterly debt service or other requirements, our
    revolving credit facility can be utilized as a source of
    liquidity until such cash can be repatriated in a cost effective
    manner.

We expect to receive approximately $10 million in principal
    amount of zero coupon Greek treasury bonds in settlement of
    amounts due us from sales to the public hospital system in
    Greece for 2007, 2008 and 2009. The bonds mature over a three
    year period. At December 31, 2010 we provided an allowance
    of $2.5 million to reflect the respective outstanding
    receivables at that date at the fair value of Greek treasury
    bonds with a comparable maturity.

We believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and
    cash equivalents, borrowings under our revolving credit facility
    and sales of accounts receivable under our securitization
    program will enable us to fund our operating requirements,
    capital expenditures and debt obligations.

Refinancing
    Transactions

In August 2010, we entered into a series of refinancing
    transactions comprised of (i) a public offering of
    $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of
    3.875% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017 (the
    “Convertible Notes”), (ii) the amendment of
    certain terms of our senior credit facilities, (iii) the
    extension of the maturity of a portion of our borrowings under
    the senior credit facilities, (iv) the repayment of
    $200.0 million of borrowings under the senior credit
    facilities, (v) the amendment of certain terms of our
    Senior Notes and (vi) the prepayment of all of our 2007
    Notes, which had an outstanding aggregate principal amount of
    $196.6 million and were scheduled to mature in 2012 and
    2014. The refinancing transactions were designed to improve near
    term liquidity and financial flexibility by extending debt
    maturities. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial
    statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for information on the refinancing.

Prepayment of
    2004 Notes

In December 2010, we prepaid $165.8 million in aggregate
    principal amount of our 2004 Notes. Of this amount,
    (i) $72.5 million was applied to the 6.66%

Series 2004-1

Tranche A Senior Notes due

7/8/11,

(ii) $48.3 million was applied to the 7.14%

Series 2004-1

Tranche B Senior Notes due

and
    (iii) $45.0 million was applied to the 7.46%

See
    Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information on the partial prepayment of the 2004
    Notes.

On February 23, 2011, we began to prepay the remaining
    aggregate principal amount of the 2004 Notes. See Note 19,
    “Subsequent Events”, to our consolidated financial
    statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

Cash Flow from
    Operating Activities

Comparison of
    2010 and 2009

Operating activities from continuing operations provided net
    cash of approximately $206.6 million during 2010. Year over
    year cash flow from operating activities increased
    $34.4 million over the comparable period in 2009. Cash flow
    from operations in 2009 was adversely affected by a
    $97.5 million tax payment on the sale of the ATI
    businesses, while the 2010 increase reflects a tax refund of
    $59.5 million and lower payments for interest and
    restructuring and integration programs. The increase was partly
    offset by a $24.6 million increase in our contributions to
    domestic defined benefit pension plans in 2010 over the
    comparable period in 2009 and an increase in receivables of
    $39.7 million that resulted from the adoption of an
    amendment to Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting
    Standards Codification topic 860, “Transfers and
    Servicing” (“ASC topic 860”) in the first quarter
    of 2010. Specifically, upon adoption of the amendment, the
    accounts receivable that we previously treated as sold and
    removed from the balance sheet under our securitization program
    are now required to be accounted for as secured borrowings and
    reflected as short-term debt on our balance sheet. The effect of
    the amendment is reflected in our condensed consolidated
    statements of cash flows under financing activities in the
    increase (decrease) in notes payable and current borrowings and
    under operating activities in the accounts receivable use of
    cash. Underlying these activities cash flow from continuing
    operations in 2010 compared to 2009 was further reduced by
    higher receivables primarily in Europe reflecting the continued
    slow down in payments from public hospitals in Italy, Spain,
    Portugal and Greece where funding continues to be under pressure
    due to weak economic conditions and higher inventories in North
    America in advance of the coming flu season.

Comparison of
    2009 and 2008

Lower tax payments of approximately $25 million and lower
    interest payments of approximately $25 million were the
    primary contributors to the higher cash flow from continuing
    operations in 2009 compared to 2008.

Changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in an
    aggregate decrease in cash from operations of approximately
    $106 million during 2009, which was comprised of a
    reduction in income taxes payable of approximately
    $117 million offset by the impact from a reduction of
    working capital of approximately $11 million. The reduction
    in taxes includes $97.5 million of taxes paid in connection
    with the sale of the ATI businesses in 2009. The reduction in
    working capital results principally from (i) lower
    inventory due largely to inventory control efforts in both the
    Aerospace and Commercial segments in response to weak demand
    during 2009, coupled with deliveries of cargo handling systems
    in the Aerospace Segment that had been delayed from 2008 into
    2009; (ii) lower accounts receivable, primarily in the
    Aerospace Segment, reflecting lower sales, partly offset by
    higher receivables in the Medical Segment due to a slow down in
    payments from



public hospitals in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece where
    funding has been under pressure due to weak economic conditions.
    These reductions in cash flow were partly offset by
    (iii) lower accounts payable and accrued expenses largely
    due to reduced spending on inventory in the Aerospace Segment
    coupled with reduced payments of termination benefits and
    contract termination costs in restructuring and integration
    reserves.

Cash Flow from
    Investing Activities

Investing activities from continuing operations provided net
    cash of $148.4 million in 2010, primarily due to
    $24.7 million in proceeds from the sale of SSI,
    $50.0 million from the sale of Heavy Lift and
    $93.9 million from the sale of the Actuation business,
    partly offset by capital expenditures of $33.5 million.

Our cash flows from investing activities from continuing
    operations in 2009 consisted primarily of proceeds from the
    sales of the ATI businesses and Power Systems operations, partly
    offset by capital expenditures of $28.7 million.

Cash Flow from
    Financing Activities

Financing activities from continuing operations used net cash of
    $336.6 million in 2010. During the third quarter of 2010,
    in connection with the refinancing of a portion of our long-term
    debt, we issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal
    amount of Convertible Notes. As part of our effort to reduce the
    potential dilution resulting from the issuance of our common
    stock

and/or

reduce our exposure to potential cash payments we may be
    required to make upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, we
    entered into hedging transactions involving the purchase of call
    options and the sale of warrants (see Note 9 to our
    consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K

for further information). We used approximately
    $88.0 million of the Convertible Note proceeds to purchase
    the call options, which was partially offset by the receipt of
    $59.4 million from the sale of the warrants. We used
    $200.0 million of the Convertible Note proceeds to repay
    term loan borrowings under our senior credit facility. In
    connection with the refinancing transactions we incurred
    $21.4 million of transaction fees and expenses, including
    underwriters’ discounts and commissions. We used the
    remainder of the net proceeds, together with available cash, to
    prepay all of our outstanding 2007 Notes at an aggregate
    prepayment purchase price equal to the aggregate outstanding
    principal amount of $196.6 million, plus a prepayment
    make-whole amount of $28.1 million. During the fourth
    quarter of 2010 we prepaid $165.8 million in aggregate
    principal amount of our 2004 Notes, which required the payment
    to the 2004 noteholders of a prepayment make-whole amount of
    $15.5 million. We also paid $54.3 million of
    dividends. These reductions in cash flows from financing
    activities were partly offset by the $29.4 million increase
    in notes payable and current borrowings as a result of the
    application of the amendment to ASC topic 860, discussed above,
    to our securitization program, which resulted in the reporting
    of the securitization program as a secured borrowing in 2010.

Our cash flows from financing activities from continuing
    operations in 2009 consisted primarily of $357.6 million
    repayment of long-term debt and payment of dividends of
    $54.0 million, partly offset by borrowings of
    $10.0 million under our revolving credit facility.

Fixed rate borrowings, excluding the effect of derivative
    instruments, comprised 53% of total borrowings at
    December 31, 2010. Fixed rate borrowings, including the
    effect of derivative instruments, comprised 91% of total
    borrowings at December 31, 2010. Less than 1% of our total
    borrowings of $917.1 million are denominated in currencies
    other than the U.S. dollar, principally the Renminbi.

Our senior credit and senior note agreements contain covenants
    that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability, and the
    ability of our subsidiaries, to incur debt, create liens,
    consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets, make certain
    investments, engage in acquisitions, pay dividends on,
    repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and
    enter into swap agreements. These agreements also require us to
    maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 3.50:1
    and a consolidated interest coverage ratio (generally,
    Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense, each as
    defined in the senior credit agreement) of not less than 3.50:1
    as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal
    quarters calculated pursuant to the definitions and methodology
    set forth in the senior credit agreement. At December 31,
    2010, our consolidated leverage ratio was 2.65:1 and our
    interest coverage ratio was 4.68:1, both of which are in
    compliance with the limits described in the preceding sentence.

At December 31, 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding and
    approximately $4 million in outstanding standby letters of
    credit under our $400 million revolving credit facility.
    This facility is used principally for seasonal working capital
    needs. We had no outstanding borrowings under this facility
    throughout 2010 until we borrowed $90 million on
    December 20, 2010 to prepay a portion of the 2004 notes
    (including fees and

make-whole

premium). We then repaid this amount from the proceeds of the
    sale of the actuation business on December 31, 2010. The
    availability of loans under this facility is dependent upon our
    ability to maintain our financial condition and our continued
    compliance with the covenants contained in the senior credit
    agreement and senior note agreements. Moreover, additional
    borrowings would be prohibited if a Material Adverse Effect (as
    defined in the senior credit agreement) were to occur.
    Notwithstanding these restrictions, we believe that this
    revolving credit facility provides us with significant
    flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs. At
    our current level of EBITDA (as defined in the senior credit
    agreement) for the year ended December 31, 2010, we would
    have been permitted $285 million of additional debt beyond
    the levels outstanding at December 31, 2010. Moreover,
    additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were
    used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of
    assets or controlling equity interests so long as the
    aforementioned leverage and interest coverage ratios are met
    after calculating EBITDA on a proforma basis to give effect to
    the acquisition.



As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all
    other terms of the senior credit agreement and the senior notes,
    and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of
    these agreements, including the leverage and interest coverage
    ratios, throughout 2011.

For additional information regarding our indebtedness, please
    see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In addition, we have an accounts receivable securitization
    facility under which we sell a security interest in domestic
    accounts receivable for consideration of up to
    $75.0 million to a commercial paper conduit; as of
    December 31, 2010, the maximum amount available for
    borrowing was $25.9 million. This facility is utilized from
    time to time for increased flexibility in funding short term
    working capital requirements. The agreement governing the
    accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain
    covenants and termination events. An occurrence of an event of
    default or a termination event under this facility may give rise
    to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility.

Stock Repurchase
    Programs

On June 14, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $300 million of our outstanding common
    stock. Repurchases of our stock under the Board authorization
    may be made from time to time in the open market and may include
    privately-negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant
    and subject to regulatory considerations. The stock repurchase
    program has no expiration date and our ability to execute on the
    program will depend on, among other factors, cash requirements
    for acquisitions, cash generation from operations, debt
    repayment obligations, market conditions and regulatory
    requirements. In addition, our senior loan agreements limit the
    aggregate amount of share repurchases and other restricted
    payments we may make to $75 million per year in the event
    our consolidated leverage ratio exceeds 3.5 to 1. Accordingly,
    these provisions may limit our ability to repurchase shares
    under this Board authorization. Through December 31, 2010,
    no shares have been purchased under this Board authorization.

(2)

Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods
    or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that
    specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum
    quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable pricing
    provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions. These
    obligations relate primarily to material purchase requirements.

We have recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax
    positions of $62.6 million and $109.9 million as of
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
    Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of
    ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably
    estimate the amount of any



income tax payments to settle uncertain income tax positions or
    the periods in which any such payments will be made.

In 2010, cash contributions to all defined benefit pension plans
    were $32.1 million, and we estimate the amount of cash
    contributions will be in the range of $7.2 million to
    $10 million in 2011. Due to the potential impact of future
    plan investment performance, changes in interest rates and other
    economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation
    in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not
    able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of
    contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit
    plans for periods beyond 2011.

See Notes 15 and 16 to our consolidated financial
    statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information.

Off Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

We have residual value guarantees under operating leases for
    certain equipment. The maximum potential amount of future
    payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is
    approximately $9.1 million. See Note 16 to our
    consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K

for additional information.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
    at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

We have identified the following as critical accounting
    estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of
    significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive
    and important to the presentation of our financial condition and
    results of operations and could potentially result in materially
    different results under different assumptions and conditions.

Accounting for
    Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

In the ordinary course of business, we grant non-interest
    bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms. In
    an effort to reduce our credit risk, we (i) establish
    credit limits for all of our customer relationships,
    (ii) perform ongoing credit evaluations of our
    customers’ financial condition, (iii) monitor the
    payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables,
    and (iv) monitor open orders against an individual
    customer’s outstanding receivable balance.

An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts
    receivable based on our historical collection experience and
    expected collectability of the accounts receivable, considering
    the period an account is outstanding, the financial position of
    the customer and information provided by credit rating services.
    The adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period
    and adjusted as necessary. Our allowance for doubtful accounts
    was $4.1 million at December 31, 2010 and
    $7.1 million at December 31, 2009 which was 1.3% and
    2.6%, respectively, of gross accounts receivable. In light of
    the disruptions in global economic markets that began in the
    fourth quarter of 2008 and has continued through 2010 we have
    heightened our risk assessment when estimating the allowance for
    doubtful accounts at December 31, 2010 by engaging in a
    more robust

customer-by-customer

risk assessment. Although future results cannot always be
    predicted by extrapolating past results, management believes
    that it is reasonably likely that future results will be
    consistent with historical trends and experience. However, if
    the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate,
    resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or
    if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends
    were to occur, additional allowances may be required.



Inventory
    Utilization

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
    Accordingly, we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete
    inventory to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to
    reflect the diminution of value resulting from product
    obsolescence, damage or other issues affecting marketability by
    an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the
    inventory and its estimated market value. Factors utilized in
    the determination of estimated market value include
    (i) current sales data and historical return rates,
    (ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive
    pricing pressures, (iv) new product introductions,
    (v) product expiration dates, and (vi) component and
    packaging obsolescence.

The adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period
    and adjusted as necessary. We regularly compare inventory
    quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related
    to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and
    excessive quantities. In assessing historical usage, we also
    qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the
    reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of
    future usage.

Our excess and obsolete inventory reserve was $38.3 million
    at December 31, 2010 and $35.3 million at
    December 31, 2009 which was 10.2% and 8.9% of gross
    inventories, at those respective dates.

Accounting for
    Long-Lived Assets and Investments

The ability to realize long-lived assets is evaluated
    periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible
    inability to recover their carrying amount. Such evaluation is
    based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow
    projections. The analyses necessarily involve significant
    management judgment. Any impairment loss, if indicated, equals
    the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
    estimated fair value of the asset.

Accounting for
    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets may represent indefinite-lived assets (e.g.,
    certain trademarks or brands), determinable-lived intangibles
    (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships,
    patents and technologies) or goodwill. Of these, only the costs
    of determinable-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over
    their estimated life. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles
    assets, primarily trademarks and brand names, are not amortized
    but are tested annually for impairment during the fourth
    quarter, using the first day of the quarter as the measurement
    date, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or
    substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying
    value may not be recoverable. Such conditions may include an
    economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the
    assessment of future operations. Our impairment testing for
    goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of
    indefinite-lived intangibles.

Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the
    impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate
    future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our
    impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost
    of capital, are consistent with internal projections and
    operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are
    also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace
    participants.



Goodwill

Impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level.
    For purposes of this assessment, the our reporting units are
    generally its businesses one level below the respective
    operating segment.

Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The
    first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a
    reporting unit, including goodwill, with its carrying value. In
    performing the first step, we calculated fair values of the
    various reporting units using equal weighting of two methods;
    one which estimates the discounted cash flows (“DCF”)
    of each of the reporting units based on projected earnings in
    the future (the Income Approach) and one which is based on sales
    of similar assets in actual transactions (the Market Approach).
    If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, there is no
    impairment. If the reporting unit carrying amount exceeds the
    fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is
    performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.

Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant
    judgment. The more significant judgments and assumptions made to
    determine the fair value of our reporting units were
    (1) the amount and timing of expected future cash flows
    which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales,
    operating income, industry trends and the regulatory environment
    of the individual reporting units, (2) the expected
    long-term growth rates for each of our reporting units, which
    approximate the expected long-term growth rate of the global
    economy and of the respective industries in which the reporting
    units operate, (3) discount rates that are used to discount
    future cash flows to their present values, which are based on an
    assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the
    respective reporting units along with various market based
    inputs, (4) determination of appropriate revenue and EBITDA
    multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value
    under the Market Approach and the selection of appropriate
    comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining
    those multiples. There were no changes to the underlying methods
    used in the current year as compared to the prior year
    valuations of our reporting units. The DCF analysis utilized in
    the fourth quarter 2010 impairment test was performed over a ten
    year time horizon for each reporting unit. For reporting units
    whose assets include goodwill, the compound growth rates during
    this period range from approximately 4% to 6% for revenue and
    from approximately 4% to 10% for operating income. Discount
    rates were 10.5% for reporting units in the Medical Segment and
    13.5% for reporting units in the Aerospace and Commercial
    segments. A perpetual growth rate of 2.5% was assumed for all
    reporting units.

In arriving at our estimate of the fair value of each reporting
    unit, we considered the results of both the DCF and the market
    comparable methods and concluded the fair value to be the
    average of the results yielded by the two methods for each
    reporting unit. Then, our current market capitalization was
    reconciled to the sum of the estimated fair values of the
    individual reporting units, plus a control premium, to ensure
    the fair value conclusions were reasonable in light of current
    market capitalization. The control premium implied by our
    analysis was approximately 35%, which was deemed to be within a
    reasonable range of observed average industry control premiums.

No impairment in the carrying value of any of our reporting
    units was evident as a result of the assessment of their
    respective fair values as determined under the methodology
    described above. The fair values of our reporting units whose
    assets include goodwill, other than the North America reporting
    unit within the Medical segment, exceed their respective
    carrying values by more than 50%. For the Medical —
    North America reporting unit, the fair value is approximately
    12% higher than its carrying value in 2010, where the fair value
    had been 41% and 18% higher than its carrying value in 2008 and
    2009, respectively. The approximately $959.0 million of
    goodwill attributed to the Medical — North America
    reporting unit constitutes approximately 66% of our total
    goodwill.

Our expected future growth rates are based on our estimates of
    future sales, operating income and cash flow and are consistent
    with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a
    modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful
    launch of new products each year which, together, more than
    offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach
    the end of their life cycle. As a result of this analysis, the
    compound



annual growth rate of sales and cash flows over the projected
    ten year period in the Medical — North America
    reporting unit is estimated to be 4% and 6%, respectively. Under
    the income approach, significant changes in assumptions would be
    required for this reporting unit to fail the step one test. For
    example, an increase of over one percent in the discount rate or
    a decrease of over 30% percent in the compound annual growth
    rate of operating income would be required to indicate
    impairment for this reporting unit. Nevertheless, while we
    believe the assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are
    reasonable and achievable the possibility remains that the core
    revenue growth of this reporting unit may not perform as
    expected, and, as a result, the estimated fair value may
    continue to decline. If our strategy and/or new products are not
    successful and we do not achieve core revenue growth in the
    future the goodwill in the Medical — North America
    reporting unit may become impaired and, in such case, we may
    incur material impairment charges.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical
    substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition
    apart from goodwill. Intangible assets we obtained through
    acquisitions are comprised mainly of technology, customer
    relationships, and trade names. The fair value of acquired
    technology and trade names is estimated by the use of a relief
    from royalty method, which values an intangible asset by
    estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an
    asset. Under this method, an owner of an intangible asset
    determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have
    been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third
    party. The royalty, which is based on the estimated rate applied
    against forecasted sales, is tax-effected and discounted to
    present value using a discount rate commensurate with the
    relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the
    asset. The fair value of acquired customer relationships is
    estimated by the use of an income approach known as the excess
    earnings method. The excess earnings method measures economic
    benefit of an asset indirectly by calculating residual profit
    attributable to the asset after appropriate returns are paid to
    complementary or contributory assets. The residual profit is
    tax-effected and discounted to present value at an appropriate
    discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the
    estimated income stream. Determining the useful life of an
    intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different
    types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and
    certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful
    lives.

Management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets on at least
    an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary. In connection
    with the analysis, management tests for impairment by comparing
    the carrying value of intangible assets to their estimated fair
    values. Since quoted market prices are seldom available for
    intangible assets, we utilize present value techniques to
    estimate fair value. Common among such approaches is the relief
    from royalty methodology described above, under which management
    estimates the direct cash flows associated with the intangible
    asset. Management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate,
    discount rate, and residual growth rate to estimate the
    forecasted cash flows associated with the asset.

Discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the
    impairment test of indefinite-lived assets during the fourth
    quarter of 2010 are comparable to the rates utilized in the
    impairment test of goodwill by segment. Compound annual growth
    rates in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade
    names in the Medical Segment ranged from 5% to 9% and a royalty
    rate of 4% was assumed. The compound annual growth rate in
    revenues projected to be generated from certain trade names in
    the Commercial Segment was 5% and a royalty rate of 2% was
    assumed. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of
    the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated as a result
    of the respective intangible assets. Assumptions about royalty
    rates are based on the rates at which similar trademarks or
    technologies are being licensed in the marketplace.

No impairment in the carrying value of any of our trade names
    was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective
    fair values as determined under the methodology described above,
    nor would impairment be evident had the fair value of each our
    indefinite-lived assets been hypothetically lower than presently
    estimated by 10% as of September 27, 2010.

We are not required to perform an annual impairment test for
    long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets
    (e.g., customer relationships); instead, long-lived assets are
    tested for impairment upon the



occurrence of a triggering event. Triggering events include the
    likely (i.e., more likely than not) disposal of a portion of
    such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market
    involving the business employing the related assets. Significant
    judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering
    event has occurred and re-assessing the reasonableness of the
    remaining useful lives of finite-lived assets by, among other
    things, assessing customer attrition rates.

Accounting for
    Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

We provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired
    employees, including pensions and postretirement healthcare
    benefits. Several statistical and other factors which are
    designed to project future events are used in calculating the
    expense and liability related to these plans. These factors
    include actuarial assumptions about discount rates, expected
    rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover
    rates and healthcare cost trend rates. We review the actuarial
    assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the
    assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.

The weighted average assumptions for U.S. and foreign plans
    used in determining net benefit cost were as follows:

Product Warranty
    Liability

We warrant to the original purchaser of certain of our products
    that we will, at our option, repair or replace, without charge,
    such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect.
    Warranty periods vary by product. We have recourse provisions
    for certain products that would enable recovery from third
    parties for amounts paid under the warranty. We accrue for
    product warranties when, based on available information, it is
    probable that customers will make claims under warranties
    relating to products that have been sold, and a reasonable
    estimate of the costs (based on historical claims experience
    relative to sales) can be made. Our estimated product warranty
    liability was $10.9 million and $12.1 million at
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.

Distributor
    Rebates

We offer rebates to certain distributors and accrue an estimate
    for the rebate as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale.
    The estimate is based on an historical experience rate of rebate
    claims by distributors over the



previous 12 months for specific product lines. The accrual
    for estimated rebates was $15.5 million and
    $13.5 million at December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009, respectively.

Share-based
    Compensation

We estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of
    grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of
    the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as
    expense over the requisite service periods. Share-based
    compensation expense is measured using a Black-Scholes option
    pricing model that takes into account highly subjective and
    complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options,
    volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield.
    The expected life of options granted represents the period of
    time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which
    is derived from the vesting period of the award, as well as
    historical exercise behavior. Expected volatility is based on a
    blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived
    from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock, which
    we believe is more reflective of the market conditions and a
    better indicator of expected volatility than solely using
    historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate is the
    implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury
    zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected
    life of the option.

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

Our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the
    deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess
    uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize
    estimates. We conduct a broad range of operations around the
    world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous
    international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax
    audits, disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation,
    the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make
    judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of
    our tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted
    tax rates, which we expect will apply to taxable income in the
    years in which those temporary differences are recovered or
    settled. The likelihood of a material change in our expected
    realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable
    income, our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and
    carrybacks, final U.S. and foreign tax settlements, and the
    effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various
    relevant jurisdictions. While management believes that its
    judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are
    appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may
    require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities,
    which could be material.

We are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred
    tax assets. We evaluate all positive and negative evidence and
    use judgments regarding past and future events, including
    operating results and available tax planning strategies that
    could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based
    on this assessment, we determine when it is more likely than not
    that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be
    realized, in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset
    our deferred tax assets in an amount equal to future tax
    benefits that may not be realized. To the extent facts and
    circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation
    allowances may be required.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of
    $49.5 million and $49.2 million at December 31,
    2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, relates
    principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain
    deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards
    in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate
    sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits
    related to the remaining net deferred tax asset. The valuation
    allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions under
    ASC topic 740 “Income Taxes,” which requires that a
    valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is
    “more likely than not” that all or a portion of
    deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Significant judgment is required in determining income tax
    provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish
    additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief
    that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain
    positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold,
    which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be
    sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority.
    In the normal



course of business, we are examined by various Federal, State
    and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential
    outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for
    the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our
    provision for income taxes. We adjust the income tax provision,
    the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in
    which facts that give rise to an adjustment become known.
    Specifically, we are currently in the midst of examinations by
    the U.S., Canadian, German and Czech Republic taxing authorities
    with respect to our income tax returns for those countries for
    various tax years. The ultimate outcomes of the examinations of
    these returns could result in increases or decreases to our
    recorded tax liabilities, which could impact our financial
    results.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market
    Risk

We are exposed to certain financial risks, specifically
    fluctuations in market interest rates, foreign currency exchange
    rates and, to a lesser extent, commodity prices. We use
    derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact
    of some of these risks. We do not enter into derivative
    instruments for trading purposes. We are also exposed to changes
    in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences
    the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings.

Interest Rate
    Risk

We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our
    borrowing activities and our cash balances. An interest rate
    swap is used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk. The
    table below provides information regarding the amortization and
    related interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and
    variable rate debt obligations. Variable interest rates shown
    below are the weighted average rates of the debt portfolio based
    on interest rates in effect on December 31, 2010. For the
    amount subject to swap, the notional amount and the related
    interest rate is shown by year of maturity. The fair value, net
    of tax, of the interest rate swap as of December 31, 2010
    was a loss of $15.4 million, which was reflected in
    accumulated other comprehensive income.

The notional value of the interest rate swap was
    $600 million at inception and was amortized to a notional
    value of $350 million in October 2010. The notional value
    of the interest rate swap will remain at $350 million until
    maturity in 2012.

(2)

The all in cost of the $350 million floating rate debt
    swapped to a fixed rate is 4.75% plus the applicable spread over
    LIBOR, which at December 31, 2010 was 222 basis points.

A 1.0% change in variable interest rates would adversely or
    positively impact our expected net earnings by approximately
    $0.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Foreign Currency
    Risk

We are exposed to currency fluctuations in connection with
    transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional
    currencies of certain subsidiaries. We have entered into forward
    contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a
    portion of projected cash flows from these exposures. These are
    primarily contracts to buy or sell a foreign currency against
    the U.S. dollar or the Euro. The fair value of the open
    forward contracts as of December 31, 2010 was a net gain of
    $0.1 million. The following table provides information
    regarding our open forward currency contracts as of
    December 31, 2010, which mature in 2011. Forward contract
    notional amounts presented below are expressed in the stated
    currencies. The total notional amount for all contracts
    translates to approximately $76 million.

    impact the translation of our non-US subsidiary net earnings and
    transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of
    certain subsidiaries by approximately $8.3 million, for the
    year ended December 31, 2011.

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
    of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
    period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
    that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
    period covered by this report are functioning



effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information
    required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and
    communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow
    timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot
    provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the
    controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can
    provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
    of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Teleflex Incorporated and its subsidiaries
    (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
    Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
    expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
    and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
    the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
    the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, management
    used the framework established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). As a result of this assessment and based on the criteria
    in the COSO framework, management has concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2010, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears
    herein.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Teleflex
    Incorporated:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index appearing on

page F-1

present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
    of Teleflex Incorporated and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
    schedule listed in the accompanying index appearing on

page F-1

presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
    forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
    consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in “Management’s Report
    on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” appearing on

page F-2.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for transfers of financial assets and variable interest entities
    effective January 1, 2010.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in
    millions, except per share)

Note 1 —

Summary of
    significant accounting policies

Consolidation:

The consolidated financial
    statements include the accounts of Teleflex Incorporated and its
    subsidiaries (the “Company”). Intercompany
    transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in
    affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but
    not a controlling equity interest, including variable interest
    entities where the Company is not the primary beneficiary, are
    carried on the equity basis. Investments in affiliates over
    which the Company does not have significant influence are
    accounted for by the cost method of accounting. These
    consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America and include management’s estimates
    and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents:

All highly liquid
    debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or
    less are classified as cash equivalents. The carrying value of
    cash equivalents approximates their current market value.

Accounts receivable:

Accounts receivable
    represents amounts due from customers related to the sale of
    products and provision of services. An allowance for doubtful
    accounts is maintained and represents the Company’s
    estimate of probable losses on realization of the full
    receivable. The allowance is provided at such time that
    management believes reasonable doubt exists that such balances
    will be collected within a reasonable period of time. The
    allowance is based on the Company’s historical experience,
    the length of time an account is outstanding, the financial
    position of the customer and information provided by credit
    rating services. The allowance for doubtful accounts was
    $4.1 million and $7.1 million as of December 31,
    2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at the
    lower of cost or market. The cost of the Company’s
    inventories is determined by the average cost method. Elements
    of cost in inventory include raw materials, direct labor, and
    manufacturing overhead. In estimating market value, the Company
    evaluates inventory for excess and obsolete quantities based on
    estimated usage and sales.

Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant
    and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated
    depreciation. Costs incurred to develop internal-use computer
    software during the application development stage generally are
    capitalized. Costs of enhancements to internal-use computer
    software are capitalized, provided that these enhancements
    result in additional functionality. Other additions and those
    improvements which increase the capacity or lengthen the useful
    lives of the assets are also capitalized. With minor exceptions,
    straight-line composite lives for depreciation of property,
    plant and equipment are as follows: land
    improvements — 5 years; buildings —
    30 years

;

machinery and equipment — 3 to
    10 years; computer equipment and software — 3 to
    5 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the
    remaining lease periods. Repairs and maintenance costs are
    expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and other intangible assets:

Goodwill
    and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not
    amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually,
    during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or
    changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Impairment losses, if any, are included in income
    from operations. The goodwill impairment test is applied to each
    of the Company’s reporting units. For purposes of this
    assessment, a reporting unit is the operating segment, or a
    business one

F-8


TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

level below that operating segment (the component level) if
    discrete financial information is prepared and regularly
    reviewed by segment management. However, components are
    aggregated as a single reporting unit if they have similar
    economic characteristics. The goodwill impairment test is
    applied using a two-step approach. In performing the first step,
    the Company calculates fair values of the various reporting
    units using equal weighting of two methods; one which estimates
    the discounted cash flows (“DCF”) of each of the
    reporting units based on projected earnings in the future (the
    Income Approach) and one which is based on sales of similar
    assets in actual transactions (the Market Approach). If the
    reporting unit carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the
    second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to
    measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. In the second
    step, the implied fair value of the goodwill is estimated as the
    fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step less the
    fair values of all net tangible and intangible assets of the
    reporting unit other than goodwill. If the carrying amount of
    the goodwill exceeds its implied fair market value, an
    impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess,
    not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill. For other
    indefinite lived intangible assets, the impairment test consists
    of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets to
    their carrying amounts.

Intangible assets consisting of intellectual property, customer
    lists and distribution rights are being amortized over their
    estimated useful lives, which are as follows: intellectual
    property, 3 to 20 years; customer lists, 5 to
    30 years; distribution rights, 3 to 22 years. The
    weighted average amortization period is approximately
    14 years. Trade names of $326.1 million are considered
    indefinite lived. The Company periodically evaluates the
    reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets.

Long-lived assets:

The ability to realize
    long-lived assets is evaluated when events or circumstances
    indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount.
    Such evaluation is based on various analyses, including
    undiscounted cash flow and profitability projections that
    incorporate, as applicable, the impact on the existing business.
    The analyses necessarily involve significant management
    judgment. Any impairment loss, if indicated, is measured as the
    amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
    estimated fair value of the asset.

Product warranty liability:

The Company
    warrants to the original purchaser of certain of its products
    that it will, at its option, repair or replace, without charge,
    such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect.
    Warranty periods vary by product. The Company has recourse
    provisions for certain products that would enable recovery from
    third parties for amounts paid under the warranty. The Company
    accrues for product warranties when, based on available
    information, it is probable that customers will make claims
    under warranties relating to products that have been sold, and a
    reasonable estimate of the costs (based on historical claims
    experience relative to sales) can be made.

Foreign currency translation:

Assets and
    liabilities of non-domestic subsidiaries denominated in local
    currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of
    exchange at the balance sheet date; income and expenses are
    translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during
    the year. The resultant translation adjustments are reported as
    a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in equity.

Derivative financial instruments:

The Company
    uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of
    hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. All instruments are entered into for
    other than trading purposes. All derivatives are recognized on
    the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
    derivatives are recorded in earnings or other comprehensive
    income, based on whether the instrument is designated as part of
    a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction.
    Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other
    comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in the period
    in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item.
    The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in current
    period earnings. If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly
    effective or it becomes

F-9


TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur,
    gains or losses on the derivative are recorded in current period
    earnings.

Share-based compensation:

The Company
    estimates the fair value of share-based awards on the date of
    grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of
    the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as
    expense over the requisite service periods. Share-based
    compensation expense is measured using a Black-Scholes option
    pricing model that takes into account highly subjective and
    complex assumptions. The expected life of options granted is
    derived from the vesting period of the award, as well as
    historical exercise behavior, and represents the period of time
    that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Expected
    volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and
    implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to
    purchase the Company’s common stock, which the Company
    believes is more reflective of the market conditions and a
    better indicator of expected volatility than would be the case
    if the Company only used historical volatility. The risk-free
    interest rate is the implied yield currently available on
    U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term
    equal to the expected life of the option.

Share-based compensation expense for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was
    $9.6 million, $8.8 million and $8.1 million,
    respectively and is included in selling, general and
    administrative expenses. The total income tax benefit recognized
    for share-based compensation arrangements for 2010, 2009 and
    2008 was $2.6 million, $2.4 million and
    $2.0 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2010, unamortized share-based
    compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, net of
    expected forfeitures, was $5.6 million, which is expected
    to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    1.9 years. Unamortized share-based compensation cost
    related to non-vested shares (restricted stock), net of expected
    forfeitures, was $8.0 million, which is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.85 years.

Share-based compensation expense recognized during a period is
    based on the value of the portion of stock-based awards that is
    ultimately expected to vest during the period less estimated
    forfeitures. Share-based compensation expense recognized in
    2010, 2009 and 2008 included compensation expense for
    (1) share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested
    as of December 25, 2005, based on the fair value on the
    grant date estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions
    of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
    Codification (“ASC”) topic 718,
    “Compensation-Stock Compensation,” and
    (2) share-based awards granted subsequent to
    December 25, 2005, based on the fair value on the grant
    date estimated in accordance with the provisions of the
    Compensation-Stock Compensation topic. The topic requires
    forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant. To minimize
    fluctuations in share-based compensation expense, management
    reviews and revises the estimate of forfeitures for all
    share-based awards on a quarterly basis based on
    management’s expectation of the awards that will ultimately
    vest. In 2010, the Company issued 169,751 non-vested shares
    (restricted stock) the majority of which vest on the third
    anniversary of the grant date (cliff vesting).

Income taxes:

The provision for income taxes
    is determined using the asset and liability approach of
    accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes
    represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or
    paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes
    paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred
    taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences
    between the financial and tax bases of the Company’s assets
    and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and
    tax laws when changes are enacted. Provision has been made for
    income taxes on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and
    affiliates, except for subsidiaries in which earnings are deemed
    to be permanently re-invested.

F-10


TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Significant judgment is required in determining income tax
    provisions and in evaluating tax positions. The Company
    establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite
    the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there
    remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum
    probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more
    likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon
    examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal
    course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are
    examined by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities.
    The Company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of these
    examinations and any future examinations for the current or
    prior years in determining the adequacy of its provision for
    income taxes. Interest accrued related to unrecognized tax
    benefits and income tax related penalties are both included in
    taxes on income from continuing operations. The Company
    periodically assesses the likelihood and amount of potential
    adjustments and adjusts the income tax provision, the current
    tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the
    facts that give rise to an adjustment become known.

Pensions and other postretirement
    benefits:

The Company provides a range of
    benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including
    pensions and postretirement healthcare. The Company records
    annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations
    which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount
    rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, compensation
    increases, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. The
    Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and
    makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates
    and trends when appropriate. The effect of the modifications is
    generally amortized over future periods.

Restructuring costs:

Restructuring costs,
    which include termination benefits, facility closure costs,
    contract termination costs and other restructuring costs are
    recorded at estimated fair value. Key assumptions in calculating
    the restructuring costs include the terms and payments that may
    be negotiated to terminate certain contractual obligations and
    the timing of employees leaving the company.

Revenue recognition:

The Company recognizes
    revenues from product sales, including sales to distributors, or
    services provided when the following revenue recognition
    criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the
    selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is
    reasonably assured. This generally occurs when products are
    shipped, when services are rendered or upon customers’
    acceptance. Revenues from product sales, net of estimated
    returns and other allowances based on historical experience and
    current trends, are recognized upon shipment of products to
    customers or distributors.

The Company’s normal policy is to accept returns only in
    cases in which the product is defective and covered under the
    Company’s standard warranty provisions. However, in the
    limited cases where an arrangement provides a right of return to
    the customer, including a distributor, the Company believes it
    has the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of returns
    based on its substantial historical experience with respect to
    these arrangements. The Company accrues any costs or losses that
    may be expected in connection with any returns in accordance
    with ASC topic 450, “Contingencies.” Revenues and cost
    of goods sold are reduced to reflect estimated returns.

Allowances for discounts and rebates related to customer
    incentive programs, which include discounts or rebates, are
    estimated and provided for in the period that the related sales
    are recorded. These allowances are recorded as a reduction of
    revenue.

Reclassifications:

Certain reclassifications
    have been made to the prior years’ consolidated financial
    statements to conform to current year presentation. Certain
    financial information is presented on a rounded basis, which may
    cause minor differences.

New accounting
    standards

The financial statements included in this report reflect changes
    resulting from the recent adoption of several accounting
    pronouncements. The subject matter of the changes, and the
    footnotes in which they appear, are as follows:

Disclosure of derivative instruments and hedging activities in
    Note 10;

Fair value of long-term debt in Note 9; and

Fair value measurements in Note 11.

Described below are several accounting pronouncements that the
    Company either recently adopted (including those reflected in
    the footnotes referenced above) or will adopt in the near future:

The Company adopted the following amendments to accounting
    standards as of January 1, 2010, the first day of its 2010
    fiscal year:

Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets — an
    amendment to Transfers and Servicing

: In June 2009, the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
    guidance to improve the information that is reported in
    financial statements about the transfer of financial assets and
    the effects of transfers of financial assets on the
    transferor’s financial position, financial performance and
    cash flows and a transferor’s continuing involvement, if
    any, with transferred financial assets. In addition, the
    guidance limits the circumstances in which a financial asset or
    a portion of a financial asset should be derecognized in the
    financial statements of the transferor when the transferor has
    not transferred the entire original financial asset. Upon the
    adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2010, the trade
    receivables under the Company’s accounts receivable
    securitization program (the “Securitization Program”)
    that were previously treated as sold and removed from the
    balance sheet are now included in accounts receivable, net, and
    the amounts outstanding under the Securitization Program are
    accounted for as a secured borrowing and reflected as short-term
    debt on the Company’s balance sheet. As of
    December 31, 2010, the amount of secured borrowing under
    the Securitization Program was $29.7 million. In addition,
    while there was no change in the arrangement under the
    Securitization Program, the adoption of this amendment affected
    the cash flow statement by reducing cash flow from operations by
    approximately $39.7 million and increasing cash flow from
    financing activities by approximately $29.7 million.

Amendment to Consolidation:

In June 2009, the
    FASB issued guidance that requires an enterprise to perform an
    analysis to determine whether the enterprise’s variable
    interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest
    in a variable interest entity (which would result in the
    enterprise being deemed the primary beneficiary of that entity
    and, therefore, obligated to consolidate the variable interest
    entity in its financial statements); to require ongoing
    reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary
    beneficiary of a variable interest entity; to revise guidance
    for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity;
    and to require enhanced disclosures that will provide more
    transparent information about an enterprise’s involvement
    with a variable interest entity. As a result of the adoption of
    this guidance, the Company deconsolidated a variable interest
    entity, which had revenue of approximately $10 million
    during 2009, because the Company did not have a controlling
    financial interest. Refer to the Company’s consolidated
    statements of changes in equity included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K

for the impact of the deconsolidation.

Amendment to Fair Value Measurements and
    Disclosures:

In January 2010, the FASB issued an
    update that amends disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring
    fair value measurements. The amendment requires new disclosures
    about transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 and
    to provide a reconciliation of the activity in Level 3 fair
    value measurements that presents changes resulting from
    purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis. In
    addition the amendment clarifies existing disclosures with
    respect to classes of assets

F-12


TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and liabilities for which an entity should provide fair value
    measurement disclosures, as well as the disclosures surrounding
    the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value.
    The guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting
    periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the
    disclosures related to Level 3 fair value measurement
    activity which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2010. The amendment did not have an impact on
    the Company’s fair value disclosures. The Company will
    provide the additional disclosures related to Level 3
    pension plan assets, if any, following the effective date for
    amendments affecting Level 3 disclosures.

Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables
    and the Allowance for Credit Losses:

In July 2010, the FASB
    issued an update to the Receivables topic that increased
    disclosures about the allowance for credit losses and the credit
    quality of financing receivables. The additional disclosures are
    intended to help assess an entity’s credit risk exposures
    and to assess the adequacy of an entity’s allowance for
    credit losses. The guidance does not apply to financing
    receivables that have a contractual maturity of one year or less
    and that arise from the sale of goods and services. As of
    December 31, 2010, the new disclosure guidance did not have
    an effect on the Company’s disclosures. The new disclosures
    are required for interim and annual periods ending after
    December 15, 2010, except for disclosures of period
    activity (i.e., allowance roll-forward and modification
    disclosures), which are required for interim and annual periods
    beginning after December 15, 2010.

The Company will adopt the following new accounting standards as
    of January 1, 2011, the first day of its 2011 fiscal year:

Amendment to Software:

In October 2009, the
    FASB changed the accounting model for revenue arrangements for
    certain tangible products containing both software components
    and nonsoftware components. The guidance provides direction on
    how to determine which software, if any, relating to the
    tangible product is excluded from the scope of the software
    revenue guidance. The amendment will be effective prospectively
    for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The
    amendment is not expected to have a material impact on the
    Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial
    position.

Amendment to Revenue Recognition:

In October
    2009, the FASB revised the criteria for multiple-deliverable
    revenue arrangements by establishing new guidance on how to
    separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate
    arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting.
    Additionally, the guidance requires vendors to expand their
    disclosures regarding multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.
    The guidance became effective prospectively for revenue
    arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years
    beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The amendment is not
    expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results
    of operations, cash flows or financial position.

Note 3 —

Integration

In connection with its acquisition of Arrow International, Inc.
    (“Arrow”) in October 2007, the Company formulated a
    plan related to the integration of Arrow and the Company’s
    Medical businesses. The integration plan focuses on the closure
    of Arrow corporate functions and the consolidation of
    manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution functions in
    North America, Europe and Asia. The Company finalized its
    estimate of the costs to implement the plan in the fourth
    quarter of 2008. The Company has accrued estimates for certain
    costs, related primarily to personnel reductions and facility
    closures and the termination of certain distribution agreements.

Contract termination costs relate to the termination of a
    European distributor agreement that is currently in litigation
    but is expected to be paid in 2011.

In conjunction with the plan for the integration of Arrow and
    the Company’s Medical businesses, the Company has taken
    actions that affect employees and facilities of Teleflex. This
    aspect of the integration plan is explained in Note 4,
    “Restructuring and other impairment charges.” Costs
    that affect employees and facilities of Teleflex are charged to
    earnings and included in “restructuring and other
    impairment charges” in the consolidated statements of
    income for the periods in which the costs are incurred.

2008 Commercial
    Segment Program

In December 2008, the Company began certain restructuring
    initiatives with respect to the Company’s Commercial
    Segment. These initiatives involve the consolidation of
    operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain of
    the Company’s facilities in North America and Europe. The
    Company implemented these initiatives as a means to address an
    expected continuation of weakness in the marine and industrial
    markets.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company expects future
    restructuring expenses associated with the 2007 Arrow
    integration program, if any, to be nominal.

    Restructuring Program

In June 2006, the Company began certain restructuring
    initiatives that affected all three of the Company’s
    reporting segments. These initiatives involved the consolidation
    of operations and a related reduction in workforce at several of
    the Company’s facilities in Europe and North America. The
    Company implemented these initiatives as a means to improving
    operating performance and to better leverage the Company’s
    existing resources.

For 2008, the charges associated with the 2006 restructuring
    program, all of which were accrued in the Medical Segment were
    as follows:


(Dollars in

Contract termination costs

Termination benefits were comprised of severance-related
    payments for all employees terminated in connection with the
    2006 restructuring program. Contract termination costs related
    primarily to the termination of leases in conjunction with the
    consolidation of facilities.

The 2006 Restructuring program ended as of December 31,
    2008, and no costs were incurred under this program in 2010 and
    2009. The accrued liability at December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009 was nominal.

Impairment
    Charges

During the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded
    $2.3 million in impairment charges with respect to an
    intangible asset in the Commercial Segment. See Note 5,
    “Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.” During
    the third quarter of 2009, based on continued deterioration in
    the California real estate market, the Company recorded
    $3.3 million in impairment charges to fully write-off an
    investment in a real estate venture in California. The Company
    initially invested in the venture in 2004 by contributing
    property and other assets that had been part of one of its
    former manufacturing sites.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the following charges were
    recognized:

•

Charges of $2.7 million were recorded in the fourth quarter
    of 2008 related to five of the Company’s minority held
    investments due to deteriorating economic conditions.

•

The Company recorded a $0.8 million impairment of an
    intangible asset in the Commercial Segment that was identified
    during the annual impairment testing process.

•

An asset classified as held for sale was determined to be
    impaired and a $0.2 million impairment charge was
    recognized.

•

The Company recorded restructuring charges comprised of asset
    impairment charges of $1.5 million in the Commercial
    Segment for facilities involved in the 2008 Commercial Segment
    restructuring program and $5.2 million in the Medical
    Segment related to facilities that were reclassified to held for
    sale as of the fourth quarter of 2008.

Note 5 —

Impairment of
    Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company performed an interim review of goodwill and
    intangible assets in the Marine and Cargo Container reporting
    units during the second quarter of 2009 and determined that
    $6.7 million of goodwill in the Cargo Container operations
    and $2.3 million of indefinite lived trade names in the
    Marine operations were impaired. Accordingly, the Company
    recorded a $9.0 million impairment charge with respect to
    these assets. The Company performed this interim review in
    response to the difficult market conditions in which these
    reporting units were operating and the significant deterioration
    in the operating performance of these reporting units which
    accelerated in the second quarter of 2009.

In performing the goodwill impairment test, the Company
    estimated the fair values of these two reporting units, a
    Level 3 measurement as defined by the fair value hierarchy
    (see Note 11, “Fair Value Measurement”), by a
    combination of (i) estimation of the discounted cash flows
    of each of the reporting units based on projected earnings in
    the future (the income approach) and (ii) analysis of sales
    of similar assets in actual transactions (the market approach).
    Using this methodology, the Company determined that the entire
    $6.7 million of goodwill in the Cargo Container reporting
    unit was impaired, but that goodwill in the Marine reporting
    unit was not impaired. In performing the impairment test for the
    indefinite lived intangibles, the Company estimated the direct
    cash flows associated with the applicable intangible assets
    using a “relief from royalty” methodology associated
    with revenues projected to be generated from these intangibles.
    Under this methodology, the owner of an intangible asset must
    determine the arms length royalty that likely would have been
    charged if the owner had to license that asset from a third
    party. This analysis indicated that certain trade names in the
    Marine reporting unit were impaired by $2.3 million.

In 2008, certain trade names in the Commercial Segment were
    determined to be impaired by $0.8 million.

subordinated obligations and are (i) not guaranteed by any

    right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and
    future senior indebtedness (iii) junior to the
    Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the
    extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

The Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the
    holder only under the following circumstances (i) during
    any fiscal quarter, if the last reported sales price of the
    Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days during
    a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last
    trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter exceeds
    130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; or
    (ii) during the five business day period after any five
    consecutive trading day period (the “measurement
    period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal
    amount of Convertible Notes is less than 98% of the product of
    the last reported sale price of the common stock and the
    applicable conversion rate on each trading day during the
    measurement period; or (iii) upon the occurrence of
    specified corporate events; or (iv) at any time on or after
    May 1, 2017 up to and including July 28, 2017. The
    Convertible Notes are convertible at a conversion rate of
    16.3084 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount
    of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price
    of approximately $61.32. The conversion rate is subject to
    adjustment upon certain events. Upon conversion, the
    Company’s conversion obligation may be satisfied, at the
    Company’s option, in shares of common stock, cash or a
    combination of cash and shares of common stock. The Company has
    initially elected a net-settlement method to satisfy its
    conversion obligation. The net-settlement method allows the
    Company to settle the $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible
    Notes in cash and to settle the excess conversion value in
    shares, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares.

In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the
    Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with
    two counterparties pursuant to which it purchased call options
    for $88.0 million ($56.0 million net of tax) in
    private transactions. The call options allow the Company to
    receive, in effect for no additional consideration, shares of
    the Company’s common stock

and/or

cash
    from counterparties equal to the amounts of common stock

and/or

cash
    related to the excess conversion value that it would pay to the
    holders of the Convertible Notes upon conversion. These call
    options will terminate upon the earlier of July 28, 2017 or
    the first day all of the related Convertible Notes are no longer
    outstanding due to conversion or otherwise.

The Company also entered into privately negotiated warrant
    transactions with the same counterparties generally relating to
    the same number of shares of common stock with each of the
    option counterparties. Under certain circumstances, the Company
    may be required under the terms of the warrant transactions to
    issue up to 19.99% of the shares of common stock outstanding on
    August 3, 2010, which equals 7,981,422 shares of
    common stock (subject to adjustments). The warrants have been
    divided into components that expire ratably over a 180 day
    period commencing November 1, 2017. The strike price of the
    warrants is approximately $74.65 per share of common stock,
    subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. Proceeds
    received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately
    $59.4 million.

The convertible note hedge and warrant transactions described
    above are intended to reduce the potential dilution with respect
    to the Company’s common stock

and/or

reduce the Company’s exposure to potential cash payments
    that the Company may be required to make upon conversion of the
    Convertible Notes by, in effect, increasing the conversion price
    to $74.65 per share. However, the warrant transactions could
    have a dilutive effect with respect to the common stock or, if
    the Company so elects, obligate the Company to make cash
    payments to the extent that the market price per share of common
    stock exceeds $74.65 per share on any expiration date of the
    warrants.

The initial offering of the Convertible Notes was for
    $350.0 million, with an overallotment option that allowed
    the underwriters to purchase an additional principal amount of
    $50.0 million. The underwriters exercised their option on
    August 4, 2010 resulting in a total offering of
    $400.0 million of the Convertible Notes.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company entered into the contracts for both the call options
    and warrants in connection with the Convertible Notes on
    August 3, 2010. Existing accounting guidance provides that
    the call option and warrant contracts be treated as derivative
    instruments for the one day that the overallotment option was
    outstanding. Once the overallotment provision was exercised, the
    option and warrant contracts were re-classified to equity since
    the settlement terms of the Company’s call options and
    warrant contracts allow the Company to elect net cash settlement
    or net-share settlement under both contracts. The equity
    components of the option and warrants will not be adjusted for
    subsequent changes in fair value. As a result of treating these
    instruments as derivatives prior to exercise of the
    overallotment option, the Company recorded a non-cash gain on
    the call options of $2.2 million and a non-cash loss on the
    warrants of $1.8 million, resulting in a net gain of
    $0.4 million in operating income.

The Company allocated the proceeds of the Convertible Notes
    between the liability and equity components of the debt. The
    initial $316.3 million liability component was determined
    based on the fair value of a similar debt instrument excluding
    the conversion feature. The initial $83.7 million
    ($53.3 million net of tax) equity component represented the
    difference between the fair value or carrying value of
    $316.3 million of the debt and the $400.0 million of
    proceeds. The related debt discount of $83.7 million will
    be amortized under the interest method over the remaining life
    of the Convertible Notes, which, at December 31, 2010, is
    approximately 6.6 years. An effective interest rate of
    7.814% was used to calculate the debt discount on the
    Convertible Notes. The following table provides interest expense

Senior
    Credit Facility

On August 9, 2010, the Company repaid $200.0 million
    of its term loan borrowings under its senior credit facility and
    amended certain terms of its existing senior credit agreement.
    In connection with the amendment, the Company extended the final
    maturity date of $363.9 million of its remaining
    $400.0 million term loan borrowings and $366.3 million
    of commitments under its $400.0 million revolving credit
    facility from October 1, 2012 to October 1, 2014. The
    extended term loans are to be repaid in accordance with an
    amortization schedule, with quarterly payments of 2.5% of the
    original principal amount of the extended term loans commencing
    on December 31, 2012. In addition, the amendment increased
    the applicable interest rate margin for the extended loans and
    commitments. As amended, the range of the applicable margin for
    borrowings bearing interest at the “base rate”
    (greater of either the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%,
    the prime rate or one month LIBOR plus 1.0%) increased to a
    range of 0.50% to 1.75%, and the range of the applicable margin
    for extended borrowings bearing interest at the “LIBOR
    rate” for the period corresponding to the applicable
    interest period of the borrowings increased to a range of 1.50%
    to 2.75%. In addition, the commitment fee rate on unused but
    committed portions of the revolving credit facility increased to
    a range of 0.375% to 0.50%. The

actual amount of the applicable margin and commitment fee rate
    will be based on the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to
    Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the senior credit
    agreement). At December 31, 2010, the spread over LIBOR was
    225 basis points, the commitment fee rate was 0.375%.

The senior credit agreement was further amended to
    (i) permit an additional $200.0 million of
    indebtedness for unsecured, senior subordinated or subordinated
    notes; (ii) add a mandatory prepayment of term loans upon
    the occurrence of certain prepayments in cash of certain
    Convertible Notes, either in satisfaction of the rights of the
    holders of such Convertible Notes to convert or the rights of
    the holders of such Convertible Notes to require repurchase of
    the Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change (as defined in
    the indenture governing such Convertible Notes), in an amount
    equal to the amount used to prepay the applicable Convertible
    Notes to be ratably applied to the term loans under the credit
    agreement and the Senior Notes; (iii) amend the definition
    of “Consolidated EBITDA” to permit add-backs for fees
    and expenses incurred in connection with the $200.0 million
    repayment of existing term loan borrowings under the credit
    agreement and the prepayment make-whole amounts in connection
    with any prepayment on the Senior Notes, with such amendment
    only to take effect upon the prepayment of all of the Senior
    Notes or the amendment of such Senior Notes to permit
    corresponding add-backs; (iv) provide that, upon the
    prepayment of all of the Senior Notes or the amendment of such
    Senior Notes to increase the permitted leverage ratio to a level
    above 3.5 to 1, the credit agreement will, upon written
    notification to the administrative agent, automatically be
    amended to provide for either (1) an increase of the
    leverage ratio covenant to 4.0 to 1 (in the case of prepayment
    of the Senior Notes) or (2) an increase corresponding to an
    increase in the leverage ratio covenant in the Senior Notes (up
    to a leverage ratio of 4.0 to 1); and (v) provide that upon
    the prepayment of all of the Senior Notes or the amendment of
    such Senior Notes to increase the pro forma leverage ratio
    restriction for permitted acquisitions to a level above 3.50 to
    1, the credit agreement will, upon written notification to the
    administrative agent, automatically be amended to provide for
    either (1) an increase of the pro forma leverage ratio
    restriction for permitted acquisitions to 3.75 to 1 (in the case
    of prepayment of the Senior Notes) or (2) an increase
    corresponding to an increase in the pro forma leverage ratio
    restriction for permitted acquisitions in the Senior Notes (up
    to a pro forma leverage ratio of 3.75 to 1).

The Company’s senior credit and senior note agreements
    contain covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict
    its ability, and the ability of its subsidiaries, to incur debt,
    create liens, consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets,
    make certain investments, engage in acquisitions, pay dividends
    on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock
    and enter into swap agreements. These agreements also require
    the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not
    more than 3.50:1 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio
    (generally, Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest
    Expense, each as defined in the senior credit agreement) of not
    less than 3.50:1 as of the last day of any period of four
    consecutive fiscal quarters calculated pursuant to the
    definitions and methodology set forth in the senior credit
    agreement. At December 31, 2010, the Company’s
    consolidated leverage ratio was 2.65:1 and its interest coverage
    ratio was 4.68:1, both of which are in compliance with the
    limits described in the preceding sentence. As of
    December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all
    other terms of the senior credit agreement and the senior notes.

At the time of the refinancing transactions, the Company had an
    interest rate swap covering a notional amount of
    $375 million designated as a hedge against the variability
    of the cash flows in the interest payments under the term loan
    due to changes in the LIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate. The Company
    has determined that the interest rate swap may continue to be
    designated as a cash flow hedge with respect to the amended and
    extended term loan. The amendment and extension of the term loan
    did not result in a substantial modification and the critical
    terms of the variable rate debt (notional amount, re-pricing
    dates and benchmark interest rate) were unchanged. As of
    December 31, 2010, the notional value of the interest rate
    swap was $350 million.

Senior Note
    Amendments

In connection with the refinancing transactions, the Senior
    Notes were amended to permit certain terms of the Convertible
    Notes and the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions.
    Specifically, the amendments to the Senior Notes amended
    restrictions on indebtedness, restricted payments and swap
    agreements and an event of default provision in connection with
    the Convertible Notes and any convertible notes the Company may
    issue in the future. In addition, the holders of the Senior
    Notes consented to the subordination provisions that would apply
    to offerings of certain convertible notes. The amendment also
    added a mandatory offer to prepay the Senior Notes upon the
    occurrence of certain prepayments in cash of certain convertible
    notes, either in satisfaction of the rights of the holders of
    such convertible notes to convert or in satisfaction of the
    rights of the holders of such convertible notes to require
    repurchase of the convertible notes upon a fundamental change
    (as defined in the indenture governing such convertible notes),
    in an amount equal to the amount used to prepay certain
    convertible notes to be ratably applied to the Senior Notes and
    the term loans under the Senior Credit Facility.

Prepayment of
    2007 Notes

On August 13, 2010, the Company prepaid all of its
    outstanding 2007 Notes, consisting of $130.0 million
    aggregate principal amount of 7.62% Series A Senior Notes
    due 2012, $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.94%
    Series B Senior Notes due 2014 and $26.6 million
    aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Series C Senior
    Notes due 2012, at an aggregate prepayment purchase price equal
    to the aggregate principal amount of $196.6 million plus a
    $28.1 million prepayment make-whole amount and accrued and
    unpaid interest. The Company recorded the $28.1 million
    make-whole payment, unamortized debt issuance costs of
    $0.6 million incurred prior to the refinancing transactions
    and legal fees as loss on extinguishments of debt during the
    third quarter of 2010.

Debt and
    equity issuance and amendment fees related to Refinancing
    Transactions

The Company incurred transaction fees of approximately
    $8.4 million related to the amendment of the senior credit
    agreement for underwriters’ discounts and commissions and
    other transaction fees. Under existing accounting guidance, the
    Company treated the $200.0 million repayment of the term
    loan as a debt extinguishment and the remaining
    $400.0 million of the term loan as a debt modification. The
    changes to the revolving credit component of the Senior Credit
    Facility were also deemed to be a modification. The Company
    allocated the transaction fees evenly between the term loan and
    the revolving credit facility. Approximately $2.7 million
    of the transaction fees represented third party transaction fees
    related to the modified term loan that were expensed in the
    third quarter of 2010 as selling, general and administrative
    expenses. The remaining $5.7 million in transaction fees
    was deferred and will be amortized over the amended term of the
    facility as additional interest expense. In addition, the
    Company expensed approximately $1.6 million of unamortized
    Senior Credit Facility debt issuance costs that were incurred
    prior to the refinancing transactions related to the
    $200.0 million repayment as loss on extinguishments of debt.

In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the
    Company incurred transaction fees of approximately
    $13.0 million for underwriters’ discounts and
    commissions and other transaction fees. Under existing
    accounting guidance, the Company allocated approximately
    $3.6 million to the respective equity components and the
    remaining $9.4 million was recorded as a deferred asset to
    be amortized over the outstanding term of the Convertible Notes
    as additional interest expense.

Other
    debt

At December 31, 2010, the Company had no borrowings and
    approximately $4 million of standby letters of credit
    issued under its revolving line of credit. The Company has
    approximately $396 million available in committed financing
    through the senior credit agreement.

The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet
    as of December 31, 2010 for long-term debt is
    $885.9 million. Using a discounted cash flow technique that
    incorporates a market interest yield curve with adjustments for
    duration, optionality, and risk profile, the Company has
    determined the fair value of its debt to be $991.4 million
    at December 31, 2010. The Company’s corporate credit
    rating is a factor in determining the market interest yield
    curve.

In addition, the Company has an accounts receivable
    securitization facility under which accounts receivable of
    certain domestic subsidiaries are sold on a non-recourse basis
    to a special purpose entity (“SPE”), which is a
    bankruptcy-remote, consolidated subsidiary of Teleflex.
    Accordingly, the assets of the SPE are not available to satisfy
    the obligations of Teleflex or any of its subsidiaries. The SPE
    then sells undivided interests in those receivables to an asset
    backed commercial paper conduit for consideration of up to
    $75.0 million. As of December 31, 2010, the maximum
    amount available for borrowing under this facility was
    $25.9 million. This facility is utilized from time to time
    for increased flexibility in funding short term working capital
    requirements. The agreement governing the accounts receivable
    securitization facility contains certain covenants and
    termination events. An occurrence of an event of default or a
    termination event under this facility may give rise to the right
    of its counterparty to terminate this facility.

Notes payable at December 31, 2010 consists of a demand
    loan of $1.5 million borrowed at an interest rate of 6.6%
    and the accounts receivable securitization facility described
    above.

Financial
    instruments

The Company uses derivative instruments for risk management
    purposes. Forward rate contracts are used to manage foreign
    currency transaction exposure and interest rate swaps are used
    to reduce exposure to interest rate changes. These derivative
    instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded
    on the balance sheet at fair market value. The effective portion
    of the gains or losses on derivatives are reported as a
    component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into
    earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged
    transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative
    representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components
    excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in
    current earnings. Approximately $9.3 million of the amount
    in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31,
    2010 would be reclassified as expense to the statement of income
    during 2011 should foreign currency exchange rates and interest
    rates remain at December 31, 2010 levels. See Note 11,

Valuation
    Hierarchy

The Derivatives and Hedging Standard establishes a valuation
    hierarchy of the inputs (i.e. assumptions that market
    participants would use in pricing an asset or liability) used to
    measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into
    three broad levels as follows:

Level 1 inputs —

quoted prices
    (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities that the Company has ability to access at the
    measurement date.

Level 2 inputs —

inputs other than quoted
    prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the
    asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset
    or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2
    input must be observable for substantially the full term of the
    asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include:

1. Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in
    active markets.

F-28


TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2. Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
    liabilities in markets that are not active.

3. Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for
    the asset or liability.

4. Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated
    by observable market data by correlation or other means.

Level 3 inputs —

unobservable inputs for
    the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs may be used to
    measure fair value only when observable inputs are not
    available. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s
    assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use
    in pricing the asset or liability in achieving the fair value
    measurement objective of an exit price perspective. An exit
    price is the price that would be received to sell an asset or
    paid to transfer a liability.

A financial asset or liability’s classification within the
    hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is
    significant to the fair value measurement.

Valuation
    Techniques

The Company has determined the fair value of its financial
    assets based on Level 1 and Level 2 inputs and the
    fair value of its financial liabilities based on Level 2
    inputs in accordance with the fair value hierarchy established
    under accounting standards. The Company’s financial assets
    valued based upon Level 1 inputs are comprised of
    investments in marketable securities held in trusts which are
    used to pay benefits under certain of the Company’s
    deferred compensation plans. Under these plans, participants
    designate investment options to serve as the basis for
    measurement of the notional value of their accounts. The
    investment assets of the trusts are valued using quoted market
    prices.

The Company’s financial assets valued based upon
    Level 2 inputs are comprised of foreign currency forward
    contracts. The Company’s financial liabilities valued based
    upon Level 2 inputs are comprised of an interest rate swap
    contract and foreign currency forward contracts. The Company
    uses foreign currency forward rate contracts to manage currency
    transaction exposure and interest rate swaps to manage exposure
    to interest rate changes. The fair value of the foreign currency
    forward exchange contracts represents the amount required to
    enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining
    maturities based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the
    interest rate swap contract is developed from market-based

    for additional information.

Note 12 —

Shareholders’
    equity

The authorized capital of the Company is comprised of
    200 million common shares, $1 par value, and 500,000
    preference shares. No preference shares have been outstanding
    during the last three years.

On June 14, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of
    outstanding Company common stock. Repurchases of Company stock
    under the Board authorization may be made from time to time in
    the open market and may include privately-negotiated
    transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to
    regulatory considerations. The stock repurchase program has no
    expiration date, and the Company’s ability to execute on
    the program will depend on, among other factors, cash
    requirements for acquisitions, cash generation from operations,
    debt repayment obligations, market conditions and regulatory
    requirements. In addition, under the Company’s senior
    credit and Senior Note agreements, the Company is subject to
    certain restrictions relating to its ability to repurchase
    shares in the event the Company’s consolidated leverage
    ratio exceeds certain levels, which may further limit the
    Company’s ability to repurchase

shares under this Board authorization. Through December 31,
    2010, no shares have been purchased under this Board
    authorization.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
    the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed in the same
    manner except that the weighted average number of shares is
    increased for dilutive securities. The difference between basic
    and diluted weighted average common shares results from the
    assumption that dilutive stock options were exercised. A
    reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares
    outstanding is as follows:

Stock
    compensation plans

The Company has two stock-based compensation plans under which
    equity-based awards may be made. The Company’s 2000 Stock
    Compensation Plan (the “2000 plan”) provides for the
    granting of incentive and non-qualified stock options and
    restricted stock units to directors, officers and key employees.
    Under the 2000 plan, the Company is authorized to issue up to
    4 million shares of common stock, but no more than 800,000
    of those shares may be issued as restricted stock. Options
    granted under the 2000 plan have an exercise price equal to the
    average of the high and low sales prices of the Company’s
    common stock on the date of the grant, rounded to the nearest
    $0.25. Generally, options granted under the 2000 plan are
    exercisable three to five years after the date of the grant and
    expire no more than ten years from the grant date. Outstanding
    restricted stock units generally vest in one to three years. In
    2010, the Company granted restricted stock units representing
    169,751 shares of common stock under the 2000 plan. The
    unrecognized compensation expense for these awards as of the
    grant date was $9.7 million, which will be recognized over
    the vesting period of the awards. As of December 31, 2010,
    301,504 shares were available for future grant under the
    2000 plan.

The Company’s 2008 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2008
    plan”) provides for the granting of various types of
    equity-based awards to directors, officers and key employees.
    These awards include incentive and non-qualified stock options,
    stock appreciation rights, stock awards and other stock-based
    awards. Under the 2008 plan, the Company is authorized to issue
    up to 2.5 million shares of common stock, but grants of
    awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights
    may not exceed 875,000 shares. Options granted under the
    2008 plan have an exercise price equal to the closing price of
    the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. In 2010,
    the Company granted incentive and non-qualified options to
    purchase 599,042 shares of common stock under the 2008
    plan. The unrecognized compensation expense for these awards as
    of the grant date was $7.4 million,

which will be recognized over the vesting period of the awards.
    As of December 31, 2010, 1,591,016 shares were
    available for future grant under the 2008 plan.

The fair value for options granted in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was
    estimated at the date of grant using a multiple point
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following
    weighted-average assumptions were used:

The fair value for non-vested shares granted in 2010, 2009 and
    2008 was estimated at the date of grant based on the market rate
    on the grant date discounted for the risk free interest rate and
    the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period.

The Company applied a simplified method to establish the

    (“APIC Pool”) related to the tax effects of employee
    stock-based compensation and to determine the subsequent impact
    on the APIC Pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of
    the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that
    are outstanding.

In 2009, the Company sold its interest in Airfoil Technologies
    International Singapore and several related entities and sold
    several entities in its Power Systems division. These businesses
    had income before taxes for 2008 of $75.3 million, which
    are reported as part of discontinued operations. The company
    recorded a gain on the sale of these businesses of
    $272.3 million along with related taxes on the gain of
    $102.9 million. The gain and related taxes are reported as
    discontinued operations.

At December 31, 2010, the cumulative unremitted earnings of
    other subsidiaries outside the United States, considered
    permanently reinvested, for which no income or withholding taxes
    have been provided, approximated $673.9 million. Such
    earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely and, as a
    result, no deferred tax liability has been recognized with
    regard to the remittance of such earnings. It is not practicable
    to estimate the income tax liability that might be incurred if
    such earnings were remitted to the United States.

The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to
    examinations by various taxing authorities. In conjunction with
    these examinations and as a regular and routine practice, the
    Company establishes

and/or

adjusts reserves with respect to its uncertain tax positions as
    developments merit. We realized a benefit of approximately
    $8.6 million as a result of reducing our reserves with
    respect to uncertain tax positions. This change was driven
    principally by the fact that we (i) reduced our US tax
    reserves as a result of the conclusion of audits of certain US
    tax returns and because the applicable Statute of Limitations
    with respect to certain other US returns expired, and
    (ii) increased our reserves as the result of developments
    in the ongoing tax examinations in the Czech Republic and
    Germany.

During the third quarter of 2010, we determined that an

out-of-period

adjustment associated with tax returns filed and tax audit
    conclusions was required which reduced income tax expense by
    approximately $5.7 million. Management has determined that
    this was not material on a quantitative or qualitative basis to
    the prior period financial statements.

During the fourth quarter of 2009, we determined that an

out-of-period

adjustment was required to correct our financial statement tax
    related balance sheet accounts. Correction of this error
    decreased deferred tax liabilities and our taxes payable by
    approximately $3.2 million and reduced income tax expense
    approximately $3.2 million. Based on our analysis, we
    concluded that this matter was not material on a quantitative or
    qualitative basis to the prior period financial statements.

Under the tax laws of various jurisdictions in which the Company
    operates, deductions or credits that cannot be fully utilized
    for tax purposes during the current year may be carried forward,
    subject to statutory limitations, to reduce taxable income or
    taxes payable in a future tax year. At December 31, 2010,
    the tax effect of such carry forwards approximated
    $61.5 million. Of this amount, $10.8 million has no
    expiration date, $2.1 million expires after 2010 but before
    the end of 2015 and $48.6 million expires after 2015. A
    substantial amount of these carry forwards consist of tax losses
    which were acquired in an acquisition by the Company in 2004.
    Therefore, the utilization of these tax attributes is subject to
    an annual limitation imposed by Section 382 of the Internal
    Revenue Code, which limits a company’s ability to deduct
    prior net operating losses following a more than 50 percent
    change in ownership. It is not expected that this annual
    limitation will prevent the Company from utilizing its carry
    forwards. The determination of state net operating loss carry
    forwards is dependent upon the U.S. subsidiaries’
    taxable income or loss, apportionment percentages and other
    respective state laws, which can change from year to year and
    impact the amount of such carry forward.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of
    $49.5 million and $49.2 million at December 31,
    2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, relates
    principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain
    deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carry
    forwards in various jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was
    calculated in accordance with accounting standards, which
    requires that a valuation allowance be established and
    maintained when it is “more likely than not” that all
    or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The Company accrues interest and penalties associated with

The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to income
    tax examinations by various taxing authorities. As of
    December 31, 2010, the most significant tax examinations in
    process are in the jurisdictions of the United States, Canada,
    Czech Republic and Germany. It is uncertain as to when these
    examinations may be concluded and the ultimate outcome of such
    examinations. As a result of the uncertain outcome of these
    ongoing examinations, future examinations, or the expiration of
    statutes of limitation for certain jurisdictions, it is
    reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits
    for tax positions taken could materially change from those
    recorded as liabilities at December 31, 2010. Due to the
    potential for resolution of certain foreign

and U.S. examinations, and the expiration of various
    statutes of limitation, it is reasonably possible that the
    Company’s unrecognized tax benefits may change within the
    next twelve months by a range of zero to $19 million.

Note 15 —

Pension and other
    postretirement benefits

The Company has a number of defined benefit pension and
    postretirement plans covering eligible U.S. and

non-U.S. employees.

The defined benefit pension plans are noncontributory. The
    benefits under these plans are based primarily on years of
    service and employees’ pay near retirement. The
    Company’s funding policy for U.S. plans is to
    contribute annually, at a minimum, amounts required by
    applicable laws and regulations. Obligations under

non-U.S. plans

are systematically provided for by depositing funds with
    trustees or by book reserves.

In 2010, the Company made a $30 million cash contribution
    to the Teleflex Retirement Income Plan (“TRIP”) to
    improve the funded status of the pension plan.

In 2009, the Company offered certain qualifying individuals an
    early retirement program. Based on the individuals that accepted
    the offer, the Company recognized special termination costs of
    $402 thousand in pension expense and $395 thousand in
    postretirement expense in the second quarter of 2009.

In 2008, the Company took the following actions with respect to
    its pension benefits:

•

Effective August 31, 2008, the Arrow Salaried plan, the
    Arrow Hourly plan and the Berks plan were merged into the
    Teleflex Retirement Income Plan (“TRIP”).

•

On October 31, 2008, the TRIP was amended to cease future
    benefit accruals for all employees, other than those subject to
    a collective bargaining agreement, as of December 31, 2008.

•

On December 15, 2008, the Company amended its Supplemental
    Executive Retirement Plans (“SERP”) for all executives
    to cease future benefit accruals as of December 31, 2008.
    In addition, the Company replaced the non-qualified defined
    benefits provided under the SERP with a non-qualified defined
    contribution arrangement under the Company’s Deferred
    Compensation Plan, effective January 1, 2009.

In addition, on October 31, 2008, the Company’s
    postretirement benefit plans were amended to eliminate future
    benefits for employees, other than those subject to a collective
    bargaining agreement, who had not attained age 50 and whose
    age plus service was less than 65.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries provide medical,
    dental and life insurance benefits to pensioners and survivors.
    The associated plans are unfunded and approved claims are paid
    from Company funds.

The discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine
    the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be
    required to settle the Company’s pension and other benefit
    obligations. The discount rates for U.S. pension plans and
    other benefit plans of 5.35% and 5.05%, respectively, were
    established by comparing the projection of expected benefit
    payments to the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve (published
    monthly) as of December 31, 2010. The Citigroup Pension
    Discount Curve was designed to provide a market average discount
    rate to asset plan sponsors in valuing the liabilities
    associated with post retirement obligations. The expected
    benefit payments are discounted by each corresponding discount
    rate on the yield curve. For payments beyond 30 years, the
    Company extends the curve assuming that the discount rate
    derived in year 30 is extended to the end of the plan’s
    payment expectations. Once the present value of the string of
    benefit

TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

payments is established, the Company determines the single rate
    on the yield curve that, when applied to all obligations of the
    plan, will exactly match the previously determined present value.

The Company’s assumption for the Expected Return on Assets
    is primarily based on the determination of an expected return
    for its current portfolio. This determination is made using
    assumptions for return and volatility of the portfolio. Asset
    class assumptions are set using a combination of empirical and
    forward-looking analysis. To the extent that history has been
    skewed by unsustainable trends or events, the effects of those
    trends are quantified and removed. The Company applies a variety
    of models for filtering historical data and isolating the
    fundamental characteristics of asset classes. These models
    provide empirical return estimates for each asset class, which
    are then reviewed and combined with a qualitative assessment of
    long term relationships between asset classes before a return
    estimate is finalized. This provides an additional means for
    correcting for the effect of unrealistic or unsustainable
    short-term valuations or trends, opting instead for return
    levels and behavior that is more likely to prevail over long
    periods.

Increasing the assumed healthcare trend rate by 1% would
    increase the benefit obligation by $4.7 million and would
    increase the 2010 benefit expense by $0.4 million.
    Decreasing the trend rate by 1% would decrease the benefit
    obligation by $4.1 million and would decrease the 2010
    benefit expense by $0.3 million.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. and foreign
    defined benefit pension plans was $353.7 million and
    $331.5 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit
    obligation, and fair value of plan assets for U.S. and
    foreign plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of
    plan assets were $353.3 million, $353.0 million and
    $261.2 million, respectively for 2010 and
    $331.0 million, $330.7 million and
    $217.2 million, respectively for 2009.

The Company’s investment objective is to achieve an
    enhanced long-term rate of return on plan assets, subject to a
    prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing
    the security of benefits for participants. These investments are
    held primarily in equity and fixed income mutual funds. The
    Company’s other investments are largely comprised of a
    hedge fund of funds. The equity funds are diversified in terms
    of domestic and international equity securities, as well as
    small, middle and large capitalization stocks. The domestic
    mutual funds held in the plans are subject to the
    diversification and industry concentration restrictions set
    forth in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The
    Company’s target allocation percentage is as follows:
    equity securities (60%); fixed-income securities (30%) and other
    securities (10%). Equity funds are held for their expected
    return over inflation. Fixed-income funds are held for
    diversification relative to equities and as a partial hedge of
    interest rate risk to plan liabilities. The other investments
    are held to further diversify assets within the plans and
    provide a mix of equity and bond like return with a bond like
    risk profile. The plans may also hold cash to meet liquidity
    requirements. Actual performance may not be consistent with the
    respective investment strategies. Investment risks and returns
    are measured and monitored on an on-going basis through annual
    liability measurements and investment portfolio reviews to
    determine whether the asset allocation targets continue to
    represent an appropriate balance of expected risk and reward.

(e)

As of December 31, 2010, this category comprises a hedge
    fund that invests in various other hedge funds. Approximately
    24% of the assets of the hedge fund were invested in equity
    hedge based funds, including equity long/short and equity market
    neutral strategies. Approximately 23% of the assets were held in
    tactical/directional based funds, including global macro,
    long/short equity, commodity and systematic quantitative
    strategies. Approximately 23% of the assets were held in
    relative value based funds, including convertible and fixed
    income arbitrage, credit long/short and volatility arbitrage
    strategies. In addition, approximately 22% of the assets were
    held in funds with an event driven strategy. The remaining
    assets were held in cash.

The Company’s contributions to U.S. and foreign
    pension plans during 2011 are expected to be in the range of
    $7.2 million to $10.0 million. Contributions to
    postretirement healthcare plans during 2011 are expected to be
    approximately $3.9 million.

The Company’s expected benefit payments for U.S. and
    foreign plans for each of the five succeeding years and the
    aggregate of the five years thereafter, net of the annual
    average Medicare Part D subsidy of approximately
    $0.3 million, is as follows:

Product warranty liability:

The Company
    warrants to the original purchaser of certain of its products
    that it will, at its option, repair or replace, without charge,
    such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect.
    Warranty periods vary by product. The Company has recourse
    provisions for certain products that would enable recovery from
    third parties for amounts paid under the warranty. The Company
    accrues for product warranties when, based on available
    information, it is probable that customers will make claims

Operating leases:

The Company uses various
    leased facilities and equipment in its operations. The lease
    terms for these assets vary. In connection with these operating
    leases, the Company had residual value guarantees in the amount
    of approximately $9.1 million at December 31, 2010.
    The Company’s future payments cannot exceed the minimum
    rent obligation plus the residual value guarantee amount. The
    guarantee amounts are tied to the unamortized lease values of
    the assets under lease, and are payable should the Company
    decide neither to renew these leases, nor to exercise its
    purchase option. At December 31, 2010, the Company had no
    liabilities recorded for these obligations. Any residual value
    guarantee amounts paid to the lessor may be recovered by the
    Company from the sale of the assets to a third party.

Future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2010
    (including residual value guarantee amounts) under noncancelable
    operating leases are as follows:

Rental expense under operating leases was $30.3 million,

    2008, respectively.

Environmental:

The Company is subject to
    contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations
    that in the future may require the Company to take further
    action to correct the effects on the environment of prior
    disposal practices or releases of chemical or petroleum
    substances by the Company or other parties. Much of this
    liability results from the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”),
    often referred to as Superfund, the U.S. Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and similar
    state laws. These laws require the Company to undertake certain
    investigative and remedial activities at sites where the Company
    conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where
    Company-generated waste was disposed.

Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost
    from site to site. These activities, and their associated costs,
    depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving
    remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and
    enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of
    potentially responsible parties. At December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009, the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet included an accrued liability of $6.9 million and
    $8.1 million, respectively, relating to these matters.
    Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs and,
    under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability

may exceed the amount accrued as of December 31, 2010. The
    time-frame over which the accrued or presently unrecognized
    amounts may be paid out, based on past history, is estimated to
    be

15-20 years.

Regulatory matters:

On October 11, 2007,
    the Company’s subsidiary, Arrow International, Inc.
    (“Arrow”), received a corporate warning letter from
    the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The letter
    expressed concerns with Arrow’s quality systems, including
    complaint handling, corrective and preventive action, process
    and design validation, inspection and training procedures. It
    also advised that Arrow’s corporate-wide program to
    evaluate, correct and prevent quality system issues had been
    deficient.

The Company developed and implemented a comprehensive plan to
    correct the issues raised in the letter and further improve
    overall quality systems. From the end of 2009 to the beginning
    of 2010, the FDA reinspected the Arrow facilities covered by the
    corporate warning letter, and Arrow has responded to the
    observations issued by the FDA as a result of those inspections.
    Communications received from the FDA indicate that the FDA has
    classified its inspection observations as “voluntary action
    indicated,” or VAI. This classification signifies that the
    FDA has concluded that no further regulatory action is required,
    and that any observations made during the inspections can be
    addressed voluntarily by the Company. In addition, in the third
    quarter of 2010, Arrow submitted and received FDA approval of
    all currently eligible requests for certificates to foreign
    governments, or CFGs. The Company believes that the FDA’s
    approval of its CFG requests is a clear indication that Arrow
    has substantially corrected the quality system issues identified
    in the corporate warning letter. The Company is continuing to
    work with the FDA to resolve all remaining issues and obtain
    formal closure of the corporate warning letter.

While the Company continues to believe it has substantially
    remediated the issues raised in the corporate warning letter
    through the corrective actions taken to date, the corporate
    warning letter remains in place pending final resolution of all
    outstanding issues, which the Company is actively working with
    the FDA to resolve. If the Company’s remedial actions are
    not satisfactory to the FDA, the Company may have to devote
    additional financial and human resources to its efforts, and the
    FDA may take further regulatory actions against the Company.

Litigation:

The Company is a party to various
    lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business.
    These lawsuits and claims include actions involving product
    liability, intellectual property, employment and environmental
    matters. Based on information currently available, advice of
    counsel, established reserves and other resources, the Company
    does not believe that any such actions are likely to be,
    individually or in the aggregate, material to its business,
    financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
    However, in the event of unexpected further developments, it is
    possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, or other
    similar matters, if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to
    the Company’s business, financial condition, results of
    operations or liquidity. Legal costs such as outside counsel
    fees and expenses are charged to expense in the period incurred.

Other:

The Company has various purchase
    commitments for materials, supplies and items of permanent
    investment incident to the ordinary conduct of business. On
    average, such commitments are not at prices in excess of current
    market.

Note 17 —

Business segments
    and other information

An operating segment is a component of an enterprise
    (a) that engages in business activities from which it may
    earn revenues and incur expenses, (b) whose operating
    results are regularly reviewed by the enterprise’s chief
    operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be
    allocated to the segment and to assess its performance, and
    (c) for which discrete financial information is available.
    Based on these criteria, the Company has determined that it has
    three operating segments: Medical, Aerospace and Commercial.

The Medical Segment businesses design, manufacture and
    distribute medical devices primarily used in critical care,
    surgical applications and cardiac care. Additionally, the
    company designs, manufactures and supplies devices and
    instruments for other medical device manufacturers. Over
    90 percent of Medical Segment net revenues are derived from
    devices that are considered disposable or single use. The
    Medical Segment’s products are largely sold and distributed
    to hospitals and healthcare providers and are most widely used
    in the acute care setting for a range of diagnostic and
    therapeutic procedures and in general and specialty surgical
    applications.

The Aerospace Segment businesses provide cargo handling systems
    for wide body and narrow body aircraft. Commercial aviation
    markets represent all of the revenues in this segment. Markets
    for these products are generally influenced by spending patterns
    in the commercial aviation markets and cargo market trends.

The Commercial Segment businesses principally design,
    manufacture and distribute driver controls and engine and drive
    parts for the marine market. Commercial Segment products are
    used in recreational marine and marine transportation.

On December 31, 2010, the Company completed the sale of the
    Actuation business of its subsidiary Telair International
    Incorporated to TransDigm Group, Incorporated for approximately
    $94 million and realized a gain of $51.2 million, net
    of tax, from the sale of the business.

On June 25 2010, the Company completed the sale of its rigging
    products and services business (“Heavy Lift”), a
    reporting unit within its Commercial Segment, to Houston
    Wire & Cable Company for $50 million and realized
    a gain of $17.0 million, net of tax, from the sale of the
    business.

On March 2, 2010, the Company completed the sale of its SSI
    Surgical Services Inc. business, a reporting unit within its
    Medical Segment, to a privately-owned multi-service line
    healthcare company for approximately $25 million and
    realized a gain of $2.2 million, net of tax.

During the third quarter of 2009, the Company completed the sale
    of its Power Systems operations to Fuel Systems Solutions, Inc.
    for $14.5 million and realized a loss of $3.3 million,
    net of tax.

On March 20, 2009, the Company completed the sale of its
    51 percent share of Airfoil Technologies
    International — Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“ATI
    Singapore”) to GE Pacific Private Limited for
    $300 million in cash. ATI Singapore, which provides engine
    repair products and services for critical components of flight
    turbines, was part of a joint venture between General Electric
    Company (“GE”) and the Company. In December 2009, the
    Company completed the transfer of its ownership interest in the
    remaining ATI business to GE.

    sale in 2007 of the Company’s business units that design
    and manufacture automotive and industrial driver controls,
    motion systems and fluid handling systems (“the GMS
    businesses”). Also during the second quarter of 2008, the
    Company recorded a charge for the settlement of a contingency
    related to the sale of the GMS businesses. These activities
    resulted in a decrease in the gain on sale of the GMS businesses
    and are reported in discontinued operations as a loss of
    $14.2 million, with related taxes of $6.0 million.

On January 10, 2011, the Company’s Medical Segment
    acquired VasoNova Inc. to complement the Critical Care division
    for an upfront payment of $25 million with additional
    payments of between $15 million and $30 million to be
    made based on the achievement of certain regulatory and revenue
    targets over the next three years.

On January 30, 2011, Jeffrey P. Black resigned by mutual
    agreement with the Company’s board of directors as
    Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company
    and as a member of the Company’s board of directors,
    effective immediately. In connection with Mr. Black’s
    resignation, Mr. Black will receive benefits and payments
    as provided under his employment agreement with the Company
    dated as of March 26, 2009 that we have estimated to be
    approximately $5.5 million and which will be reflected as a
    charge in the first quarter of 2011.

On February 14, 2011, the Company issued notice to the
    holders of the 2004 Notes of its election to prepay all of the
    $165.8 million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of
    the 2004 Notes, which is comprised of
    (i) $72.5 million aggregate principal amount of 6.66%
    Series A Senior Notes due 2011;

    in aggregate principal amount of the 2004 Notes, together with a
    make-whole prepayment amount of $8.2 million and accrued
    interest. The remaining $64.0 million in aggregate
    principal amount will be prepaid on March 16, 2011,
    together with accrued interest of $0.6 million and
    estimated prepayment fees of approximately $5.3 million.

The prepayment of the 2004 Notes that occurred on
    February 23, 2011, was funded by borrowings under the
    Company’s Senior Credit Facility and available cash. The
    Company expects to use further borrowings under its Senior
    Credit Facility and available cash to fund the prepayment of the
    2004 Notes that remain outstanding.
