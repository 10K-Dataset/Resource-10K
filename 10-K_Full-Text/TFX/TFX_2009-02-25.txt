PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

Teleflex Incorporated (referred to herein as “we,”
    “us,” “our,” “Teleflex” and the
    “Company”) is a diversified company specializing in
    the design, manufacture and distribution of quality engineered
    products and services. The Company serves a wide range of
    customers in segments of the medical, aerospace and commercial
    industries. The Company’s products include: medical devices
    used in critical care and anesthesia applications, surgical
    instruments and devices, cardiac assist devices for hospitals
    and healthcare providers and instruments and devices delivered
    to medical device manufacturers; aerospace engine repair
    products and services and cargo-handling systems and equipment
    used in commercial aircraft; and marine driver controls, engine
    assemblies and drive parts, power and fuel management systems
    and rigging products and services for commercial industries.

For more than 65 years, we have provided
    specialty-engineered products that help our customers meet their
    business requirements. We have grown through an active program
    of development of new products, introduction of products into
    new geographic or end-markets and through acquisitions of
    companies with related market, technology or industry expertise.
    We serve a diverse customer base in over 150 countries through
    our own operations and through local direct sales and
    distribution networks.

We are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth
    through our internal growth initiatives which include the
    development of new products, expansion of market share, moving
    existing products into new geographies, and through selected
    acquisitions which enhance or expedite our development
    initiatives and our ability to grow market share. We continually
    evaluate the composition of the portfolio of our businesses to
    ensure alignment with our overall objectives.

We strive to maintain a portfolio of businesses that provide
    consistency of performance, improved profitability and
    sustainable growth. To this end, in 2007 we significantly
    changed the composition of our portfolio through acquisitions in
    all three business segments and divestitures in both our
    Commercial and Aerospace segments. Specifically, in our Medical
    Segment, we completed the acquisition of Arrow International, a
    medical products company with annual net revenues of over
    $500 million, which significantly expanded the segment. We
    also completed the acquisition of a small orthopedic device
    manufacturer to expand our capability to serve medical device
    manufacturers. In our Commercial Segment, we acquired a rigging
    services business with annual net revenues of approximately
    $25 million. At the end of 2007, we completed the
    divestiture of our automotive and industrial businesses
    (“GMS”) with 2007 net revenues of over
    $860 million, significantly reducing the size of our
    Commercial Segment. In our Aerospace Segment, we acquired a
    cargo equipment business with annual net revenues of
    approximately $55 million and divested a
    precision — machined components business with
    approximately $130 million in annual net revenues. These
    measures were taken to improve margins, reduce cyclicality and
    focus our resources on the development of our core businesses.
    We continually evaluate the composition of the portfolio of our
    businesses to ensure alignment with our overall objectives.

Our Business
    Segments

We organize our business into three business
    segments — Medical, Aerospace and Commercial. For
    2008, the percentages of our consolidated net revenues
    represented by our segments were as follows: Medical —
    62 percent, Aerospace — 21 percent and
    Commercial — 17 percent.

Further detail and additional information regarding our segments
    and geographic areas is presented in Note 16 to our
    consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.



Discontinued
    Operations

At the end of 2007, we completed the sale of our business units
    that design and manufacture automotive and industrial driver
    controls, motion systems and fluid handling systems to Kongsberg
    Automotive Holding ASA for $560 million in cash. On
    June 29, 2007, we completed the sale of a
    precision-machined components business in our Aerospace Segment
    for approximately $134 million in cash and in 2006, we sold
    a small medical business.

These businesses met the criteria for reporting discontinued
    operations under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 144. “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” In compliance
    with SFAS No. 144, the Company has reported results of
    operations, cash flows and gains (losses) on the disposition of
    these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods
    presented. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial
    statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further information regarding divestiture activity and
    accounting for discontinued operations.

The following business segment and product category information
    reflects businesses in continuing operations as of
    December 31, 2008.

Business Segment
    Overview

Medical

The businesses in our Medical Segment design, manufacture and
    distribute medical products primarily used in critical care,
    surgical applications and cardiac care. Additionally, we design,
    manufacture and supply devices and instruments for medical
    device manufacturers. We are focused on providing disposable or
    single use medical products for critical care and surgery that
    enhance patient outcomes by providing products that are less
    invasive, reduce infection and improve patient safety.

Our products are largely sold and distributed to hospitals and
    healthcare providers and are most widely used in the acute care
    setting for a range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and
    in general and specialty surgical applications. Major
    manufacturing operations are located in Czech Republic, Germany,
    Malaysia, Mexico and the United States. Approximately
    50 percent of our segment net revenues are derived from
    customers outside the United States.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, we acquired Arrow International,
    a leading global supplier of catheter-based medical technology
    products used for vascular access and cardiac care. This
    acquisition significantly expanded our disposable medical
    product offerings for critical care, enhanced our global
    footprint and added to our research and development capabilities.

Disposable Medical Products for Critical
    Care:

This is the largest product category in the
    Medical Segment, representing 64 percent of segment net
    revenues in 2008. Disposable medical products are used in a wide
    range of critical care procedures for vascular access,
    respiratory care, anesthesia and airway management, treatment of
    urologic conditions, as well as other specialty procedures.
    Disposable medical products for critical care are generally
    marketed under the brand names of Arrow, Rüsch, HudsonRCI,
    Gibeck and Sheridan. The large majority of sales for disposable
    medical products are made to the hospital/healthcare provider
    market, with a smaller percentage sold to alternate sites.

Vascular Access Products:

Our vascular access
    products are generally catheter-based products used in a variety
    of clinical procedures to facilitate multiple critical care
    therapies including the administration of intravenous
    medications, other therapies, and the measurement of blood
    pressure and taking of blood samples through a single puncture
    site.

Vascular access catheters and related devices consist
    principally of central venous access catheters (“CVC”)
    such as the following: the
    Arrow-Howe’s

tm

Multi-Lumen Catheter, a catheter equipped with three or four
    channels, or lumens; double-and single-lumen catheters, which
    are designed for use in a variety of clinical



procedures; the Arrow Pressure Injectable CVC, which gives
    clinicians who perform CT scans the option of using an
    indwelling pressure injectable Arrow CVC without having to
    insert another catheter for their scan; and percutaneous sheath
    introducers, which are used as a means for inserting
    cardiovascular and other catheterization devices into the
    vascular system during critical care procedures.

We also provide a range of peripherally inserted central
    catheters, which are soft, flexible catheters inserted in the
    upper arm and advanced into the superior vena cava and are
    accessed for various types of intravenous medications and
    therapies, and radial artery catheters, which are used for
    measuring arterial blood pressure and taking blood samples. Our
    offerings include a pressure injectable peripherally inserted
    catheter which addresses the therapeutic need for a catheter
    that can withstand the higher pressures required by the
    injection of contrast media for CT scans.

Our vascular access products also include specialty catheters
    and related products used in a range of other procedures and
    include percutaneous thrombolytic devices, which are designed
    for clearance of thrombosed hemodialysis grafts in chronic
    hemodialysis patients; and hemodialysis access catheters,
    including the
    Cannon

®

Catheter, which is used to facilitate dialysis treatment.

Many of our vascular access catheters are treated with the
    ARROWg+ard

®

,

    or ARROWg+ard Blue
    Plus

®

,

    antiseptic surface treatments to reduce the risk of catheter
    related infection. ARROWg+ard Blue Plus, is a newer, longer
    lasting formulation of ARROWg+ard and provides antimicrobial
    treatment of the interior lumens and hubs of each catheter.

As part of our ongoing efforts to meet physicians’ needs
    for safety and management of risk of infection in the hospital
    setting, we sell a Maximal Barrier Precautions central venous
    access kit, which includes a full body drape, a catheter treated
    with the ARROWg+ard antimicrobial technology, and other
    accessories. The features of this kit were created to address
    recent guidelines for reducing catheter-related bloodstream
    infections that were set by a variety of health regulatory
    agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
    and the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare
    Organizations, among others.

Related products include custom tubing sets used to connect
    central venous catheters to blood pressure monitoring devices
    and drug infusion systems, and the Arrow InView portable
    ultrasound machine designed to support placement and
    administration of vascular access products.

Respiratory Care:

Respiratory care products
    principally consist of devices used in aerosol and medication
    delivery, oxygen therapy and ventilation management. We offer an
    extensive range of aerosol therapy products, including the
    Micromist

®

Nebulizer, the
    Neb-U-Mask

®

System and the Opti-Neb
    Pro

tm

Compressor. We are also a global provider of oxygen supplies,
    offering a broad range of products to deliver oxygen therapy
    safely and comfortably. These include masks, cannulas, tubing
    and humidifiers. The full range of these products are used in a
    variety of clinical settings including hospitals, long-term care
    facilities, rehabilitation centers and patients’ homes to
    treat respiratory ailments such as chronic lung disease,
    pneumonia, cystic fibrosis and asthma.

Our ventilation management solutions promote patient safety and
    maximize clinician efficiency. These products include ventilator
    circuits with an extended life to support clinical practice
    guidelines, high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters with
    99.9999% efficiency against the transmission of bacteria and
    viruses, heat and moisture exchangers that reduce circuit
    manipulation and cross-contamination risk, and heated
    humidifiers that promote patient compliance to non-invasive
    respiratory strategies, like Non-Invasive Ventilation
    (“NIV”) and High Flow Oxygen Therapy.

The
    ConchaTherm

®

Neptune

®

is a heated humidification solution. It is designed to allow the
    caregiver to customize patient treatment to meet specific
    clinical goals. This results in advanced patient outcomes
    without sacrificing clinician efficiency.

Anesthesia and Airway
    Management:

Anesthesiologists depend on our
    highly recognized brands of Hudson, Sheridan and Rüsch
    products that include endotracheal tubes, laryngeal masks,
    airways and face



masks to deliver anesthetic agents and oxygen. To assist in the
    placement of endotracheal tubes, we provide a comprehensive and
    unique line of laryngoscope blades and handles, including
    standard halogen and fiber optic light sources. Fiber optic
    light sources offer a high intensity, cool white light without
    generating the same level of heat that comes from standard
    halogen bulbs.

Regional anesthesia products include epidural and peripheral
    nerve block catheters. Nerve blocks provide pain relief after
    surgical procedures and help clinicians better manage each
    patient’s pain. We offer the first stimulating continuous
    nerve block catheter, the Arrow StimuCath, which confirms the
    positive placement of the catheter next to the nerve. The Flex
    Tip Plus continuous epidural catheter features a soft, flexible
    tip that helps reduce the incidence of complications, such as
    transient paresthesia and inadvertent cannulation of blood
    vessels or the dura, while improving the clinician’s
    ability to thread the catheter into the epidural space. Our
    Arrow
    TheraCath

®

epidural catheter, with high compression strength for
    direction-ability and enhanced radiopacity, was designed for
    pain management procedures where increased steer-ability is
    important. Additional integral components create a range of
    standard and custom procedural kits.

Urology:

Our line of urology products provides
    bladder management products for patients in the hospital and
    home care markets. Our product portfolio consists principally of
    catheters (including Foley, intermittent, external and
    suprapubic), urine collectors, catheterization accessories and
    products for operative endurology. Teleflex Medical today has
    significant market share in Foley catheters in the EMEA markets
    (Europe, the Middle East and Africa). The intermittent catheter
    market for home care is growing quickly, and Medical Service,
    our specialist in intermittent catheterization, has a leading
    share of the German healthcare market with Liquick Base and
    mobile catheters. Teleflex Medical in Italy has also
    significantly increased its sales of intermittent catheters in
    the year 2008.

We also design our urine collectors, catheterization accessories
    and kits with Teleflex Medical’s overall infection
    prevention strategy in mind. For example, the Rüsch MMG
    Closed System intermittent catheter is used in the treatment of
    spinal cord injury patients. Our Teleflex Medical Team in North
    America successfully introduced a new version of the MMG H2O to
    the market in 2008.

Surgical Instruments and Medical
    Devices:

Products in this category represented
    20 percent of Medical Segment net revenues in 2008. Our
    surgical instrument and medical device products include:
    ligation and closure products including appliers, clips, and
    sutures used in a variety of surgical procedures, hand-held
    instruments for general and specialty surgical procedures,
    access ports used in minimally invasive surgical procedures
    including robotic surgery, and fluid management products used
    for chest drainage. In addition, we provide instrument
    management services. We market surgical instruments and medical
    devices under the Deknatel, Pleur-evac, Pilling, Taut and Weck
    brand names.

Hem-o-lok is the world’s only patented locking polymer
    ligation clip, and is a growing part of the Weck portfolio.
    Hem-o-lok clips have special applications in robotic,
    laparoscopic, and cardiovascular surgery, and provide surgeons
    with a unique level of security and performance.

In 2009, we plan to introduce the
    Taut

®

Universal Seal designed for use with the
    ADAPt

tm

line of bladeless laparoscopic access devices. The new Taut seal
    eclipses other options by providing surgeons the ability to
    perform laparoscopic procedures without flimsy diaphragm seals,
    lubricants that can smudge cameras, or the need for reducer
    caps. Coupled with the new universal seal, Taut provides a
    complete line of ports from 3mm to 15mm, including balloon ports
    and bariatric and pediatric versions. Taut ports were designed
    around the patented ADAPt asymmetrical dilating access tip that
    dilates through tissue without metal or plastic blades. The
    ADAPt tip has been shown to produce a fascial defect
    58 percent smaller than typical bladed trocars and avoids
    exposing any anatomical structures to a blade of any kind.

Devices for Original Equipment Manufacturers
    (“OEM”):

Customized medical
    instruments, implants and components sold to medical device
    manufacturers represented 10 percent of Medical Segment
    revenues in 2008. Under the well-regarded brand names of Beere
    Medical

®

,

    KMedic

®

,

    Specialized Medical
    Devices

tm

,

    Deknatel

®

and TFX
    OEM

®

we provide specialized product development services, which
    include design



engineering, prototyping and testing, manufacturing, assembly
    and packaging. Our OEM product development and manufacturing
    facilities are located in Germany, Ireland, Mexico and the
    United States.

The OEM category includes custom extrusion, catheter
    fabrication, introducer systems, sheath/dilator sets, specialty
    sutures, resins and performance fibers. We also provide machined
    and forged instrumentation for general and specialty procedures,
    Ortho-Grip

®

instrument handles and fixation devices used primarily for
    orthopedic procedures.

Cardiac Care Devices:

Cardiac care products
    accounted for approximately 5 percent of revenues in fiscal
    2008. Products in this category range from diagnostic catheters,
    such as thermodilution and wedge pressure catheters, specialized
    angiographic catheters, such as Berman and Reverse Berman
    catheters, therapeutic delivery catheters, such as temporary
    pacing catheters and intra-aortic balloon (IAB) catheters to
    capital equipment, such as intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)
    consoles. IABP products are used to augment oxygen delivery to
    the cardiac muscle and reduce the oxygen demand after cardiac
    surgery, serious heart attack or interventional procedures. The
    IAB and IABP product lines feature the AutoCAT 2
    WAVE

®

console and the
    FiberOptix

tm

catheter, which together utilize fiber optic technology for
    arterial pressure signal acquisition and allow the patented
    WAVE

®

timing algorithm to support the broadest range of patient heart
    rhythms, including severely arrhythmic patients.

    on-board cargo-loading systems for wide-body aircraft,
    baggage-handling systems for narrow body aircraft, aftermarket
    spare parts and repair services. Marketed under the Telair
    International brand name, our wide-body cargo-handling systems
    are sold to aircraft original equipment manufacturers or to
    airlines and air freight carriers as “seller

and/or

buyer
    furnished equipment” for original installations or as
    retrofits for existing equipment. Cargo-handling systems require
    a high degree of engineering sophistication and are often
    custom-designed.

In addition to the design and manufacture of cargo systems, we
    provide customers with aftermarket spare parts and repair
    services for their Telair systems. We also design, manufacture
    and repair cargo containers. In November 2007, we acquired
    Nordisk Aviation Products, expanding our customer base and
    global manufacturing and service capacity for cargo equipment.
    All of our cargo containers and pallets are now marketed to
    commercial airlines and freight companies under the Nordisk name.

We also manufacture and repair components for our systems and
    other related aircraft controls, including canopy and door
    actuators, cargo winches and flight controls.

Our Commercial Segment businesses principally design,
    manufacture and distribute driver controls and engine and drive
    assemblies for the marine market, power and fuel systems for
    truck, rail, automotive and industrial vehicles and rigging
    products and services. Our products are used in a range of
    markets including: recreational marine, heavy truck, bus,
    industrial vehicles, rail, oil and gas, marine transportation
    and industrial. Major manufacturing operations are located in
    Canada, Europe, Singapore and the United States.

Marine Driver Controls and Engine Assemblies and Drive
    Parts:

This is the largest single product
    category in the Commercial Segment, representing 48 percent
    of the Commercial Segment revenues in 2008. Products in this
    category include: shift and throttle cables, mechanical and
    hydraulic steering systems, throttle controls, instrumentation
    and engine drive parts.

We are a leading global provider of both mechanical and
    hydraulic steering systems for recreational powerboats. We are
    also a leading distributor of engine assemblies and drive parts.
    Our marine products are sold to original equipment manufacturers

Backlog:

Standard Commercial segment products
    are typically shipped between a few days and three months after
    receipt of order. Therefore, the backlog of such orders is not
    indicative of probable revenues in any future

12-month

period.

Sales and Marketing:

The majority of our
    Commercial Segment products are sold through a direct sales
    force of field representatives and technical specialists. Marine
    driver controls and engine and drive parts are sold directly to
    boat builders and engine manufacturers as well as through
    distributors, dealers and retail outlets to reach recreational
    boaters.

Auxiliary power units are primarily sold in the North American
    truck market through an agreement with a distributor and to the
    rail market using a direct sales force and distributors. Fuel
    systems and components include custom applications sold globally
    directly to industrial equipment manufacturers and to the
    automotive aftermarket principally in Europe and Latin America.
    Rigging products and services includes both a retail business
    and a wholesale business, both of which sell through a direct
    sales force.

Government
    Regulation

Government agencies in a number of countries regulate our
    products and the products sold by our customers utilizing our
    products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and
    government agencies in other countries regulate the approval,
    manufacturing, and sale and marketing of many of our healthcare
    products. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the
    European Aviation Safety Agency regulate the manufacture and
    sale of some of our aerospace products and license the operation
    of our repair stations. For more information, see ITEM 1A.
    “Risk Factors”.

Competition

Given the range and diversity of our products and markets, no
    one competitor offers competitive products for all the markets
    and customers that we serve. In general, all of our segments and
    product lines face significant competition from competitors of
    varying sizes, although the number of competitors in each market
    tends to be limited. We believe that our competitive position
    depends on the technical competence and creative ability of our
    engineering personnel, the know-how and skill of our
    manufacturing personnel, and the strength and scope of our
    sales, service and distribution networks.

Patents and
    Trademarks

We own a portfolio of patents, patents pending and trademarks.
    We also license various patents and trademarks. Patents for
    individual products extend for varying periods according to the
    date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in
    the various countries where patent protection is obtained.
    Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of
    time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks.
    All capitalized product names throughout this document are
    trademarks owned by, or licensed to, us or our subsidiaries.
    Although these have been of value and are expected to continue
    to be of value in the future, we do not consider any single
    patent or trademark, except for the Teleflex brand and the Arrow
    brand, to be essential to the operation of our business.

Suppliers and
    Materials

Materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased
    from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic
    locations. We are not dependent on any single supplier for a
    substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied
    for our overall operations. Most of the materials and components
    we use are available from multiple sources, and where practical,
    we attempt to identify alternative suppliers. Volatility in
    commodity markets, particularly steel and plastic resins, can
    have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of
    our products. We cannot be assured of successfully passing these
    cost increases through to all of our customers, particularly
    original equipment manufacturers.



Seasonality

Portions of our revenues, particularly in the Commercial and
    Medical segments, are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Revenues
    in the marine aftermarket generally increase in the second
    quarter as boat owners prepare their watercraft for the upcoming
    season. Incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as
    the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues
    related to disposable medical products.

Employees

We employed approximately 14,200 full-time and temporary
    employees at December 31, 2008. Of these employees,
    approximately 4,100 were employed in the United States and
    10,100 in countries outside of the United States. Less than
    8 percent of our employees in the United States were
    covered by union contracts. We have government-mandated
    collective-bargaining arrangements or union contracts that cover
    employees in other countries. We believe we have good
    relationships with our employees.

Investor
    Information

We are subject to the informational requirements of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Therefore, we file reports,
    proxy statements and other information with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission (SEC). Such reports, proxy and information
    statements, and other information may be obtained by visiting

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

We are subject to certain risks that could adversely affect our
    business, financial condition and results of operations. These
    risks include, but are not limited to the following:

Our inability to resolve issues related to the FDA corporate
    warning letter issued to Arrow could have an adverse impact on
    our business, financial condition and results of operations.

On October 11, 2007, Arrow received a corporate warning
    letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
    (“FDA”), which expresses concerns with Arrow’s
    quality systems, including complaint handling, corrective and
    preventive action, process and design validation and inspection
    and training procedures. While we are working with the FDA to
    resolve these issues, this work has required and will continue
    to require the dedication of significant internal and external
    resources. There can be no assurances regarding the length of
    time or cost it will take us to resolve these issues to the
    satisfaction of the FDA. In addition, if our remedial actions
    are not satisfactory to the FDA, we may need to devote
    additional financial and human resources to our efforts, and the
    FDA may take further regulatory actions against us. These
    actions may include seizing our product inventory, obtaining a
    court injunction against further marketing of our products,
    assessing civil monetary penalties or imposing a consent decree
    on us, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

A prolonged global economic recession combined with a
    continuation of volatile global credit markets could adversely
    impact our operating results, financial condition and
    liquidity.

Current global economic and financial market conditions,
    including severe disruptions in the credit markets and the
    potential for a significant and prolonged global economic
    recession, may materially and adversely affect our results of
    operations and financial condition. This could include future
    charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our
    goodwill and other intangible assets. The amount of goodwill and
    other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet have
    increased significantly in recent years, primarily as a result
    of the acquisition of Arrow International in 2007. These
    economic conditions may also materially impact our customers,
    suppliers and other parties with which we do business. Economic
    and financial market conditions that adversely affect our
    customers may cause them to terminate existing purchase orders
    or to reduce the volume of products or services they purchase
    from us in the future. The impact of the difficult economic
    environment was felt mostly in our Commercial segment during
    2008, as the markets served by our marine and auxiliary power
    unit products were adversely impacted. We expect the marine
    market to remain weak for most, if not all, of 2009. In
    addition, hospitals in some regions of the United States have
    seen a decline in admissions and a reduction in elective
    procedures and have limited their capital spending. More than
    80 percent of our Medical revenues come from disposable
    products used in critical care and surgical applications and our
    sales volume could be negatively impacted by declines in
    admission. Adverse economic and financial market conditions may
    also cause our suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments
    to us or may cause suppliers to make changes in the credit terms
    they extend to us, such as shortening the required payment
    period for outstanding accounts receivable or reducing the
    maximum amount of trade credit available to us. Changes of this
    type could significantly affect our liquidity and could have a
    material adverse effect on our results of operations and
    financial condition. If we are unable to successfully anticipate
    changing economic and financial market conditions, we may be
    unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and
    our business could be negatively affected.

We may not be able to successfully complete the integration
    of Arrow or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Arrow
    acquisition.

The integration of Arrow into our Medical Segment involves a
    number of risks and presents financial, managerial and
    operational challenges. In particular, we may have difficulty
    with, and may incur unanticipated expenses related to:

•

consolidating manufacturing and administrative functions;

•

complying with legal requirements applicable to certain aspects
    of the integration;



•

retaining key employees;

•

consolidating infrastructures and systems;

•

coordinating sales and marketing functions;

•

preserving our and Arrow’s customer, supplier and other
    important relationships; and

•

minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from
    ongoing business concerns.

The success of the Arrow acquisition will depend, in part, on
    our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings
    from successfully combining the businesses of Arrow and of
    Teleflex Medical in the time frame we anticipate. If we are not
    able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits,
    synergies and cost savings of the business combination may not
    be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than
    expected.

Failure to successfully complete the integration of Arrow or
    achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Arrow may
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

We have substantial debt obligations that could adversely
    impact our business, results of operations and financial
    condition.

We incurred significant indebtedness to fund a portion of the
    consideration for our acquisition of Arrow. As of
    December 31, 2008, our outstanding indebtedness was
    approximately $1.5 billion. We will be required to use a
    significant portion of our operating cash flow to reduce our
    indebtedness over the next few years, resulting in a reduction
    of the cash flow available to fund working capital, capital
    expenditures, acquisitions, investments and dividends. Our
    indebtedness may also subject us to greater vulnerability to
    general adverse economic and industry conditions and increase
    our vulnerability to increases in interest rates because a
    portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates.

Our senior credit facility and agreements with the holders of
    our senior notes, which we refer to as our senior debt
    facilities, impose certain operating and financial covenants
    that limit our ability to, among other things:

•

incur debt;

•

create liens;

•

consolidate, merge or dispose of assets;

•

make investments;

•

engage in acquisitions

•

pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of
    our capital stock; and

•

enter into derivative agreements to manage exposure to changes
    in interest rates.

In addition, the terms of our senior credit facilities require
    us to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our
    ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events
    beyond our control, and in the event of a significant
    deterioration of our economic performance, we cannot assure that
    we will be able to satisfy those ratios. A breach of any of
    these covenants could result in a default under our senior
    credit facilities. If we fail to maintain compliance with these
    covenants and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders under the
    senior credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all
    amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities
    to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments
    to extend further credit under such facilities. If the lenders
    under the senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of
    borrowings and we are not able to obtain financing to satisfy
    this obligation, we likely would have to liquidate significant
    assets which nevertheless may not be sufficient to repay our
    borrowings.



We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product
    liability, warranty and recall claims that may be brought
    against us.

Our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks
    that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of
    our products. In particular, our medical device products are
    often used in surgical and intensive care settings with
    seriously ill patients. Many of these products are designed to
    be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time, and
    component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or
    inadequate disclosure of product-related risks with respect to
    these or other products we manufacture or sell could result in
    an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, the patient.
    Although the Company carries product liability insurance we may
    be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event
    that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as
    expected or the use of our products results, or is alleged to
    result, in bodily injury

and/or

property damage. Accordingly, we could experience material
    warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur
    significant costs to defend these claims. In addition, if any of
    our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be
    required to participate in a recall of that product if the
    defect or the alleged defect relates to safety and experience
    lost sales, and be exposed to legal and reputational risk.
    Product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

We are subject to risks associated with our

non-U.S. operations.

Although no material concentration of our manufacturing
    operations exists in any single country, we have significant
    manufacturing operations outside the United States, including
    operations conducted through entities that are not wholly-owned
    and other alliances. As of, and for the year ended,
    December 31, 2008, approximately 44% of our total fixed
    assets and 53% of our total net revenues were attributable to
    products directly distributed from our operations outside the
    U.S. Our international operations are subject to varying
    degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the U.S.,
    including:

•

exchange controls, currency restrictions and fluctuations in
    currency values;

•

trade protection measures;

•

import or export requirements;

•

subsidies or increased access to capital for firms who are
    currently or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we
    have operations;

•

potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;

•

differing labor regulations;

•

differing protection of intellectual property;

•

unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks
    against American interests; and

•

regional and national tenders (which may be exclusive).

These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on
    our international operations or on our business, results of
    operations and financial condition generally.

Customers in our Medical Segment depend on third party
    reimbursement and the failure of healthcare programs to provide
    reimbursement or the reduction in levels of reimbursement for
    our medical products could adversely affect our Medical
    Segment.

Demand for some of our medical products is impacted by the
    reimbursement to our customers of patients’ medical
    expenses by government healthcare programs and private health
    insurers in the countries where we do business. Internationally,
    medical reimbursement systems vary significantly, with medical
    centers in some countries having fixed budgets, regardless of
    the level of patient treatment. Other countries require
    application for, and approval of, government or third party
    reimbursement. Without both favorable coverage



determinations by, and the financial support of, government and
    third party insurers, the market for some of our medical
    products could be adversely impacted.

We cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the
    current level of reimbursement to our customers for use of our
    existing products. Adverse coverage determinations or any
    reduction in the amount of this reimbursement could harm our
    business. In addition, as a result of their purchasing power,
    these payors often seek discounts, price reductions or other
    incentives from medical products suppliers. Our provision of
    such pricing concessions could negatively impact our revenues
    and product margins.

Uncertainties regarding future healthcare policy, legislation
    and regulations, as well as private market practices, could
    affect our ability to sell our products in acceptable quantities
    at profitable prices.

Foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest
    rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the
    effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity
    prices and interest rates. We expect revenue from products
    manufactured in, and sold into,

non-U.S. markets

to continue to represent a significant portion of our net
    revenue. Our consolidated financial statements reflect
    translation of financial statements denominated in

non-U.S. currencies

to U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. When the
    U.S. dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the
    foreign currencies of the countries where we sell or manufacture
    our products, such as the euro, our U.S. dollar-reported
    revenue and income will fluctuate. Although we have entered into
    forward contracts with several major financial institutions to
    hedge a portion of projected cash flows in order to reduce the
    effects of this fluctuation, changes in the relative values of
    currencies may, in some instances, have a significant effect on
    our results of operations.

Many of our products have significant steel and plastic resin
    content. We also use quantities of other commodities, including
    copper and zinc. Although we monitor our exposure to these
    commodity price increases as an integral part of our overall
    risk management program, volatility in the prices of these
    commodities could increase the costs of our products and
    services. We may not be able to pass on these costs to our
    customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations and cash flows.

Our failure to successfully develop new products could
    adversely affect our results.

The future success of our business will depend, in part, on our
    ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and
    to enhance existing products, particularly in the medical device
    industry, which is characterized by rapid product development
    and technological advances. This product development may require
    substantial investment by us. There can be no assurance that
    unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the
    development, performance or market acceptance of new
    technologies or products, such as the inability to:

•

identify viable new products;

•

obtain adequate intellectual property protection;

•

gain market acceptance of new products; or

•

successfully obtain regulatory approvals.

Moreover, we may not otherwise be able to successfully develop
    and market new products. Our failure to successfully develop and
    market new products could reduce our revenues and margins, which
    would have an adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Our technology is important to our success, and our failure
    to protect this technology could put us at a competitive
    disadvantage.

Because many of our products rely on proprietary technology, we
    believe that the development and protection of these
    intellectual property rights is important, though not essential,
    to the future success of our business. In addition to relying on
    our patents, trademarks and copyrights, we rely on
    confidentiality



agreements with employees and other measures to protect our
    know-how and trade secrets. Despite our efforts to protect
    proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy
    or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology. The
    steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of this
    technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may
    not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the
    U.S. Moreover, there can be no assurance that others will
    not independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or
    develop better technology than ours or that current and former
    employees, contractors and other parties will not breach
    confidentiality agreements, misappropriate proprietary
    information and copy or otherwise obtain and use our information
    and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise
    infringe on our intellectual property rights. Our inability to
    protect our proprietary technology could result in competitive
    harm that could adversely affect our business.

We depend upon relationships with physicians and other health
    care professionals.

The research and development of some of our products is
    dependent on our maintaining strong working relationships with
    physicians and other health care professionals. We rely on these
    professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and
    experience regarding our products and the development of our
    products. Physicians assist us as researchers, product
    consultants, inventors and as public speakers. If we fail to
    maintain our working relationships with physicians and receive
    the benefits of their knowledge, advice and input, our products
    may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and
    expectations of the professionals who use and support our
    products, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

In the course of our business, we are subject to a variety of
    litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations and financial condition.

We are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the
    normal course of business. These lawsuits and claims include
    actions involving product liability, contracts, intellectual
    property, import and export regulations, employment and
    environmental matters. The defense of these lawsuits may divert
    our management’s attention, and we may incur significant
    expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be
    required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject
    to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

While we do not believe that any litigation in which we are
    currently engaged would have such an adverse effect, the outcome
    of these legal proceedings may differ from our expectations
    because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory
    matters, are often difficult to reliably predict and we cannot
    assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Much of our business is subject to extensive government
    regulation, and our failure to comply with those regulations
    could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations and financial condition and we may incur significant
    expenses to comply with these regulations.

Numerous national and local government agencies in a number of
    countries regulate our products. The FDA and government agencies
    in other countries regulate the approval, manufacturing and sale
    and marketing of many of our medical products. The
    U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the European
    Aviation Safety Agency regulate the manufacture and sale of some
    of our aerospace products and licenses the operation of our
    repair stations.

Failure to comply with applicable regulations and quality
    assurance guidelines could lead to manufacturing shutdowns,
    product shortages, delays in product manufacturing, product
    seizures, recalls, operating restrictions, withdrawal of
    required licenses, prohibitions against exporting of products to
    countries outside the United States, importing products from
    manufacturing facilities outside the U.S., and civil and
    criminal penalties, including exclusion under Medicaid or
    Medicare, any one or more of which could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.



The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a
    medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign
    governmental authorities, can be costly and time consuming, and
    approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely
    basis, if at all, resulting in delayed realization of product
    revenues or in substantial additional costs, which could have
    material adverse effects on our financial condition and results
    of operations. Our Medical Segment facilities are subject to
    periodic inspection by the FDA and numerous other federal, state
    and foreign governmental authorities, which require
    manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain
    regulations, including testing, quality control and
    documentation procedures.

We are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining
    to healthcare pricing and fraud and abuse, including
    anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of these laws
    may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including
    substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation
    in federal and state healthcare programs.

In addition, we are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state
    and local environmental protection and health and safety laws
    governing, among other things:

•

the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous
    materials;

•

emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and

•

the health and safety of our employees.

These laws and government regulations are complex, change
    frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time.
    We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with
    current or future environmental protection and health and safety
    laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases
    of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our
    estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition
    and results of operations. Moreover, we may be subject to
    additional environmental claims, which may include claims for
    personal injury or cleanup, in the future based on our past,
    present or future business activities, which could also
    adversely affect our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Our acquisitions and strategic alliances may not meet revenue
    or profit expectations.

As part of our strategy for growth, we have made and may
    continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into
    strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development
    agreements. However, we may not be able to identify suitable
    acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate
    acquisitions successfully, and our strategic alliances may not
    prove to be successful. In this regard, acquisitions involve
    numerous risks, including difficulties in the integration of the
    operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired
    companies and the diversion of management’s attention from
    other business concerns. Although our management will endeavor
    to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction,
    there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain all
    such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and
    future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of
    substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. Future
    acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances
    of equity securities. There can be no assurance that
    difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar
    agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of
    services.

Approximately 17% of our manufacturing net revenues are produced
    by operations for which a significant part of our workforce is
    covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar
    agreements in foreign jurisdictions. It is likely that a portion
    of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining
    and similar agreements for the foreseeable future. Strikes or
    work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our
    relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our
    business.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

On October 11, 2007, the Company’s subsidiary, Arrow
    International, Inc. (“Arrow”), received a corporate
    warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
    (FDA). The letter cites three site-specific warning letters
    issued by the FDA in 2005 and subsequent inspections performed
    from June 2005 to February 2007 at Arrow’s facilities in
    the United States. The letter expresses concerns with
    Arrow’s quality systems, including complaint handling,
    corrective and preventive action, process and design validation,
    inspection and training procedures. It also advises that
    Arrow’s corporate-wide program to evaluate, correct and
    prevent quality system issues has been deficient. Limitations on
    pre-market approvals and certificates of foreign goods had
    previously been imposed on Arrow based on prior inspections and
    the corporate warning letter does not impose additional
    sanctions that are expected to have a material financial impact
    on the Company.

In connection with its acquisition of Arrow, completed on
    October 1, 2007, the Company developed an integration plan
    that includes the commitment of significant resources to correct
    these previously-identified regulatory issues and further
    improve overall quality systems. Senior management officials
    from the Company have met with FDA representatives, and a
    comprehensive written corrective action plan was presented to
    FDA in late 2007. The Company has begun implementing its
    corrective action plan, which it expects to complete, for most
    facilities and procedures, by the end of March 2009.

While the Company believes it can remediate these issues, there
    can be no assurances regarding the length of time or
    expenditures required to resolve these issues to the
    satisfaction of the FDA. If the Company’s remedial actions
    are not satisfactory to the FDA, the Company may have to devote
    additional financial and human resources to its efforts, and the
    FDA may take further regulatory actions against the Company,
    including, but not limited to, seizing its product inventory,
    obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of the
    Company’s products, assessing civil monetary penalties or
    imposing a consent decree on us.

In June 2008, HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) assessed
    Airfoil Technologies International UK Limited
    (“ATI-UK”), a consolidated United Kingdom venture in
    which the Company has a 60% economic interest, approximately
    $10 million for customs duty for the period from
    July 1, 2005 through March 31, 2008. HMRC had
    previously assessed ATI-UK approximately $737,000 for customs
    duty for the first and second quarters of 2004. Additionally,
    for the above periods, ATI-UK was assessed a value added tax
    (“VAT”) of approximately $68 million, for which
    HMRC has advised ATI-UK that, to the extent it is due and
    payable, it has until March 2010 to fully recover such VAT. The
    assessments were imposed because HMRC concluded that ATI-UK did
    not provide the necessary documentation for which reliance on
    Inland Processing Relief status (duty and VAT) was claimed by
    ATI-UK.

ATI-UK has filed appeals and been granted hardship applications
    (to avoid payment of the assessment while the appeal is pending)
    regarding each of the assessments. ATI-UK provided certain
    documentation to HMRC with regard to the first quarter of 2004,
    and as a result, the HMRC reduced the assessment for customs
    duties for that quarter by 97%, from approximately $17,860 to
    $450, and reduced the assessment for VAT for that quarter by
    99%, from approximately $117,540 to $1,650, which amounts have
    been paid and all VAT recovered. ATI-UK has provided essentially
    the same types of supporting documentation to HMRC for the
    remaining quarters for which it was assessed. Based on
    discussions between ATI-UK and the HMRC inspector with regard to
    the assessments for the remaining periods, ATI-UK is hopeful
    that it will obtain reductions in the assessments that are
    proportionately similar to those obtained for the first quarter
    of 2004. However, the Company cannot assure whether or the
    extent to which the HMRC will reduce its assessments for these
    periods. In the event ATI-UK is not



successful in a favorable resolution of the remaining
    assessments, such outcome would have a material adverse effect
    on the business of ATI-UK. The Company has a net investment in
    ATI-UK of approximately $11 million.

In addition, we are a party to various lawsuits and claims
    arising in the normal course of business. These lawsuits and
    claims include actions involving product liability, intellectual
    property, import and export regulations, employment and
    environmental matters. Based on information currently available,
    advice of counsel, established reserves and other resources, we
    do not believe that any such actions are likely to be,
    individually or in the aggregate, material to our business,
    financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
    However, in the event of unexpected further developments, it is
    possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, or other
    similar matters, if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to
    our business, financial condition, results of operations or
    liquidity.

Various senior and term note agreements provide for the
    maintenance of certain financial ratios and limit the repurchase
    of our stock and payment of cash dividends. Under the most
    restrictive of these provisions, on an annual basis
    $99 million of retained earnings was available for
    dividends and stock repurchases at December 31, 2008. On
    February 24, 2009, the Board of Directors declared a
    quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share on our common stock, which
    is payable on March 17, 2009 to holders of record on
    March 5, 2009. As of February 24, 2009, we had
    approximately 846 holders of record of our common stock.

On June 14, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of
    outstanding Company common stock. Repurchases of Company stock
    under the program may be made from time to time in the open
    market and may include privately-negotiated transactions as
    market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory
    considerations. The stock repurchase program has no expiration
    date and the Company’s ability to execute on the program
    will depend on, among other factors, cash requirements for
    acquisitions, cash generation from operations, debt repayment
    obligations, market conditions and regulatory requirements. In
    addition, under the senior loan agreements entered into
    October 1, 2007, the Company is subject to certain
    restrictions relating to its ability to repurchase shares in the
    event the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio exceeds
    certain levels, which further limit the Company’s ability
    to repurchase shares under this program. Through
    December 31, 2008, no shares have been purchased under this
    plan.

On July 25, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $140 million of outstanding Teleflex
    common stock over twelve months ended July 2006. In June 2006,
    our Board of Directors extended for an additional six months,
    until January 2007, its authorization for the repurchase of
    shares. Under the Board’s authorization, we repurchased a
    total of 2,317,347 shares on the open market during 2005
    and 2006 for an aggregate purchase price of $140.0 million,
    and aggregate fees and commissions of $0.1 million.



The following graph provides a comparison of five year
    cumulative total stockholder returns of Teleflex common stock,
    the Standard & Poor (S&P) 500 Stock Index and the
    S&P MidCap 400 Index. We have selected the S&P MidCap
    400 Index because, due to the diverse nature of our businesses,
    we do not believe that there exists a relevant published
    industry or line-of-business index and do not believe we can
    reasonably identify a peer group. The annual changes for the
    five-year period shown on the graph are based on the assumption
    that $100 had been invested in Teleflex common stock and each
    index on December 31, 2003 and that all dividends were
    reinvested.

Free cash flow is calculated by reducing cash provided by
    operating activities from continuing operations by capital
    expenditures and dividends. Free cash flow is considered a
    non-GAAP financial measure. We use this financial measure for
    internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance
    on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate
    period-to-period comparisons. This financial measure is used in
    addition to and in conjunction with results presented in
    accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the
    exclusion of GAAP financial measures. This financial measure
    reflects an additional way of viewing an aspect of our
    operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the
    accompanying reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial
    measure, provides a more complete understanding of factors and
    trends affecting our business. Management believes that free
    cash flow is a useful measure to investors because it provides
    an indication of the amount of our cash flow currently available
    to support our ongoing operations. Management strongly
    encourages investors to review our financial statements and
    publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any
    single financial measure. The following is a reconciliation of
    free cash flow to the nearest GAAP measure as required under
    Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Overview

Teleflex strives to maintain a portfolio of businesses that
    provide consistency of performance, improved profitability and
    sustainable growth. To this end, in 2007 we significantly
    changed the composition of our portfolio through acquisitions
    and divestitures to improve margins, reduce cyclicality and
    focus our resources on the development of our core businesses.
    We continually evaluate the composition of the portfolio of our
    businesses to ensure alignment with our overall objectives.

We are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth
    through our internal growth initiatives which include the
    development of new products, expansion of market share, moving
    existing products into new geographies, and through selected
    acquisitions which enhance or expedite our development
    initiatives and our ability to grow market share.

In 2007, the Company completed acquisitions in all three
    business segments and significant divestitures in both
    Commercial and Aerospace. These portfolio actions resulted in a
    significant expansion of our Medical Segment operations and a
    significant reduction in our Commercial Segment operations. The
    following bullet points summarize our more significant
    acquisitions and divestitures in 2007, and the results for the
    acquired businesses are included in the respective segments. See
    Notes 3 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information regarding our significant
    acquisitions and divestitures.

Medical
    Segment

•

October 2007 —

Acquired Arrow International,
    Inc., a leading global supplier of catheter-based medical
    technology products used for vascular access and cardiac care,
    with annual revenues of over $500 million, for
    approximately $2.1 billion.

•

April 2007

— Acquired substantially all of the
    assets of HDJ Company, Inc., providers of engineering and
    manufacturing services to medical device manufacturers with
    annual revenues of approximately $15 million, for
    approximately $25 million.

Commercial
    Segment

•

December 2007

— Divested business units that
    design and manufacture automotive and industrial driver
    controls, motion systems and fluid handling systems (the
    “GMS Businesses” with 2007 revenues of over
    $860 million, for $560 million in cash.

•

April 2007

— Acquired substantially all of the
    assets of Southern Wire Corporation, a wholesale distributor of
    wire rope cables and related hardware with annual revenues of
    approximately $25 million, for approximately
    $20 million.

Aerospace
    Segment

•

November 2007

— Acquired Nordisk Aviation
    Products A/S, a global leader in developing, manufacturing, and
    servicing containers and pallets for air cargo with annual
    revenues of approximately $55 million, for approximately
    $32 million.

•

June 2007

— Divested Teleflex Aerospace
    Manufacturing Group (“TAMG”), precision-machined
    components business with annual revenues of approximately
    $130 million, for approximately $134 million in cash.

We incurred significant indebtedness to fund a portion of the
    consideration for our October 2007 acquisition of Arrow. As of
    December 31, 2008, our outstanding indebtedness was
    approximately $1.5 billion,



down from $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2007. For
    additional information regarding our indebtedness, please see
    “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below and
    Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Global Economic
    Conditions

We operated in an increasingly challenging global economic
    environment in 2008. Recent unprecedented turbulence in the
    global financial and commodities markets and the downturn in the
    business cycle have had an adverse impact on market activities
    including, among other things, failure of financial
    institutions, falling asset values, diminished liquidity, and
    reduced demand for products and services, particularly in the
    fourth quarter of 2008. The impact of the difficult economic
    environment was felt mostly in the Commercial Segment during
    2008 and we adjusted production levels and took new
    restructuring actions in response to the current environment.
    Although, on a consolidated basis, the economic conditions have
    not had a significant adverse impact to our financial position,
    results of operations or liquidity during 2008, the continuation
    of the broad economic trends could adversely affect our
    operations in the future, as described, below. The potential
    effect of these factors on our current and future liquidity is
    discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.”

•

Medical —

Our Medical Segment serves a
    diverse base of hospitals and healthcare providers in more than
    140 countries. Healthcare policies and practice trends vary by
    country and the impact of the global economic downturn appears
    to have been limited in 2008. However reimbursement changes and
    cost pressures created by the economic slowdown could adversely
    effect the financial health of some of our hospital customers in
    2009.

Hospitals in some regions of the United States have seen a
    decline in admissions and a reduction in elective procedures and
    have limited their capital spending. More than 80 percent
    of our Medical revenues come from disposable products used in
    critical care and surgical applications and our sales volume
    could be negatively impacted by declines in admissions. In
    addition, a small percentage of our revenues could be impacted
    by changes in capital spending or a decline in elective
    procedures.

At the same time, future changes in government funding patterns
    or regulation could have an impact on our business. In the
    United States, a number of states have enacted or proposed
    reduced funding for Medicaid programs and higher rates of
    unemployment are increasing the percentage of uninsured patients
    who do not have the ability to pay for care. This could create
    further cost pressure on hospitals and consequently on our
    business. Our business could also be impacted by healthcare
    reform legislation enacted by Congress. Although the impact of
    the economic downturn on hospitals outside the United States has
    been less pronounced to date, funding to these healthcare
    institutions could be affected in the future as governments make
    further spending adjustments.

•

Aerospace —

Sudden and significant
    increases in fuel costs in mid-2008 resulted in reductions in
    capacity for passenger and cargo traffic, and accelerated
    retirement of older, less fuel efficient aircraft. These trends
    have continued even though fuel prices have decreased from these
    record levels. The sharp drop in fuel costs toward the end of
    2008 has been a positive development for airlines as it has
    offset somewhat the recession related drop in revenues for both
    passenger and cargo traffic. Lower traffic overall makes it more
    difficult to sell cargo containment equipment due to reduced
    demand, but new aircraft and weight and greenhouse gas reduction
    objectives create some opportunities in these markets. Lower
    overall aircraft utilization will reduce demand for spare parts
    for our installed base of equipment and for our jet engine
    component repair services. Nevertheless, we are well positioned
    on certain new Airbus and Boeing airframes and deliveries of
    cargo handling systems are expected to continue at previously
    expected levels overall, albeit on a slightly longer time
    horizon from earlier forecasts.



•

Commercial —

The markets served by our
    Commercial Segment are largely affected by the general state of
    the economy and by consumer confidence. Factors such as housing
    starts, home values, fuel costs, transportation, environmental
    and other regulatory matters all affect the market outlook for
    the businesses in this segment. In 2008, our Commercial Segment
    experienced a significant decrease in sales of recreational
    marine products and auxiliary power units sold into the North
    American truck market due to softness in these markets caused by
    a weak economic environment during 2008. We expect that growth
    will be a challenge in our Commercial Segment until there is
    improvement in consumer confidence and there is a return to
    global economic growth.

Results of
    Operations

Discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a
    purchased company for up to twelve months beyond the date of
    acquisition. Activity beyond the initial twelve months is
    considered core growth. Core growth excludes the impact of
    translating the results of international subsidiaries at
    different currency exchange rates from year to year and the
    comparable activity of divested companies within the most recent
    twelve-month period.

The following comparisons exclude the impact of the operations
    of TAMG, the GMS Businesses, and a small medical business which
    have been presented in our consolidated financial results as
    discontinued operations (see Note 17 to our consolidated
    financial statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for discussion of discontinued operations).

Revenues




(Dollars in millions)

Net revenues

$

2,420.9

$

1,934.3

$

1,690.8

Net revenues increased approximately 25% to $2.42 billion
    from $1.93 billion in 2007. Businesses acquired in the past
    twelve months accounted for all of this increase in revenues as
    foreign currency translation contributed 1% to revenue growth,
    while revenues from core business declined 1% compared to 2007.
    Core revenue growth in the Medical Segment (2%) and Aerospace
    (2%) was offset by a 9% decline in core revenues in the
    Commercial Segment, which was primarily due to a significant
    decrease in sales of recreational marine products and auxiliary
    power units sold into the North American truck market due to
    softness in these markets caused by a weak economic environment
    during 2008.

Revenues increased 14% in 2007 to $1.93 billion from
    $1.69 billion in 2006, entirely due to acquisitions and
    foreign currency movements. Overall, there was no core revenue
    growth in 2007 as compared to 2006. Core growth in our Aerospace
    Segment was 7%, and our Medical and Commercial segments declined
    1% and 5%, respectively year over year.

Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 39.8% in
    2008 from 35.2% in 2007. This trend is driven by increases in
    the Medical and Aerospace segments as the gross profit
    percentage in the Commercial Segment was unchanged from 2007.
    Improved margins in the Medical Segment were largely due to the
    inclusion of higher margin Arrow critical care product lines for
    the full year in 2008 compared to only the fourth quarter in
    2007 and volume related manufacturing efficiencies in the
    Medical OEM product line. Improved



margins in the Aerospace Segment are principally due to a shift
    in sales favoring engine repair services and away from sales of
    lower margin replacement parts in the engine repairs business.

Gross profit as a percentage of revenues improved to 35.2% in
    2007 from 34.6% in 2006, due primarily to cost and productivity
    improvements in our Medical Segment and the benefits of
    restructuring initiatives and other cost reduction efforts which
    offset the negative impact of a $29 million charge related
    to a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the Arrow
    acquisition, which was sold during 2007.

Selling, engineering and administrative expenses (operating

    compared to 23.0% in 2007, principally due to approximately
    $25 million higher amortization expense related to the
    Arrow acquisition and approximately $20 million higher
    expenses in the Medical Segment related to the remediation of
    FDA regulatory issues.

Selling, engineering and administrative expenses as a percentage
    of revenues increased to 23.0% in 2007 compared with 22.2% in
    2006, due primarily to approximately $7 million higher
    amortization expense from the Arrow acquisition.

In 2007, during our annual test for goodwill impairment we

    businesses that manufacture and sell auxiliary power units in
    the North American heavy truck and rail markets, as well as
    components and systems for use of alternative fuels in
    industrial vehicles and passenger cars was impaired. Softness in
    certain of these markets at that time negatively impacted the
    valuation of goodwill resulting in the impairment charge. The
    remaining $2.5 million goodwill impairment is related to a
    write-down to the agreed selling price of one our variable
    interest entities in the Commercial Segment.

The $30.0 million write-off of in-process research and
    development costs is related to in-process R&D projects
    acquired in the Arrow acquisition which we determined had no
    alternative future use in their current state.

Interest expense increased significantly in 2008 compared to
    2007 principally as a result of the full year impact of the debt
    incurred in connection with the Arrow acquisition in October
    2007. Interest income decreased in 2008 compared to 2007
    primarily due to lower amounts of invested funds combined with
    lower average interest rates.



Interest expense increased from $41.2 million to
    $74.9 million in 2007 principally as a result of higher
    debt levels since October 1, 2007 incurred in connection
    with the Arrow acquisition. Interest income increased in 2007
    compared to 2006 primarily due to higher average cash balances
    during the first three quarters of 2007.

The effective tax rate in 2007 was 112.3% compared to 23.6% in
    2008 and 21.6% in 2006. Taxes on income from continuing
    operations of $122.8 million in 2007 include discrete
    income tax charges incurred in connection with the Arrow
    acquisition. Specifically, in connection with funding the
    acquisition of Arrow, the Company (i) repatriated
    approximately $197.0 million of cash from foreign
    subsidiaries which had previously been deemed to be permanently
    reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions; and
    (ii) changed its position with respect to certain
    additional previously untaxed foreign earnings to treat these
    earnings as no longer permanently reinvested. These items
    resulted in a discrete income tax charge in 2007 of
    approximately $91.8 million. The Company did not incur
    similar charges in 2008 or 2006.

In December 2008, we began certain restructuring initiatives
    that affect the Commercial Segment. These initiatives involve
    the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in
    workforce at three of our facilities in Europe and North
    America. We determined to undertake these initiatives to improve
    operating performance and to better leverage our existing
    resources. These costs amounted to approximately
    $1.9 million during 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we
    estimate that the aggregate of future restructuring charges that
    we will incur in connection with this program are approximately
    $3.3 — $4.5 million in 2009. Of this amount,
    $2.8 — $3.1 million relates to employee
    termination costs, $0.2 — $1.0 million to
    facility closure costs and $0.3 — $0.4 million to
    contract termination costs, primarily relating to leases. We
    expect to have realized annual pre-tax savings of between
    $4 — $5 million in 2010 when these restructuring
    actions are complete.

In connection with the acquisition of Arrow during 2007, we
    formulated a plan related to the future integration of Arrow and
    our other Medical businesses. The integration plan focuses on
    the closure of Arrow corporate functions and the consolidation
    of manufacturing, sales, marketing, and distribution functions
    in North America, Europe and Asia. Costs related to actions that
    affect employees and facilities of Arrow have been included in
    the allocation of the purchase price of Arrow. Costs related to
    actions that affect employees and facilities of Teleflex are
    charged to earnings and included in restructuring and impairment
    charges within the consolidated statement of operations. These
    costs amounted to approximately $22.1 million during 2008.
    As of December 31, 2008, we estimate that the aggregate of
    future restructuring and impairment charges that we will incur
    in connection with the Arrow integration plan are approximately
    $18.0 — $21.0 million in 2009 and 2010. Of this
    amount, $7.5 — $8.5 million relates to employee
    termination costs, $1.2 — $1.7 million relates to
    facility closure costs, $9.2 — $10.5 million
    relates to contract termination costs associated with the
    termination of leases and certain distribution agreements and
    $0.1 — $0.3 million relates to other
    restructuring costs. We also have incurred restructuring related
    costs in the Medical Segment which do not qualify for



classification as restructuring costs. In 2008 these costs
    amounted to $7.0 million and are reported in the Medical
    Segment’s operating results in selling, engineering and
    administrative expenses. We expect to have realized annual
    pre-tax savings of between $70-75 million in 2010 when
    these integration and restructuring actions are complete.

In June 2006, we began certain restructuring initiatives that
    affected all three of our operating segments. These initiatives
    involved the consolidation of operations and a related reduction
    in workforce at several of our facilities in Europe and North
    America. We took these initiatives as a means to improving
    operating performance and to better leverage our existing
    resources and these activities are now complete.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we commenced implementation
    of a restructuring and divestiture program designed to improve
    future operating performance and position us for future earnings
    growth. The actions included exiting or divesting non-core or
    low performing businesses, consolidating manufacturing
    operations and reorganizing administrative functions to enable
    businesses to share services and these activities are now
    complete.

For additional information regarding our restructuring programs,
    see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Impairment charges in 2008 are composed of $2.7 million
    related to five of our minority held investments precipitated by
    the deteriorating economic conditions in the fourth quarter of
    2008, $0.8 million impairment of an intangible asset in the
    Commercial Segment that was identified during the annual
    impairment testing process, and a $0.2 million reduction in
    the carrying value of a building held for sale. In 2007, we
    determined that two minority-held investments, certain
    intangible assets and a building held for sale were impaired and
    recorded an aggregate charge of $6.4 million. In 2006, we
    determined that three minority-held investments and a building
    held for sale were impaired and recorded an aggregate charge of
    $7.4 million.

Medical

Comparison of
    2008 and 2007

Medical Segment net revenues grew 44% in 2008 to
    $1,499.1 million, from $1,041.3 million in 2007. The
    acquisition of Arrow accounted for 40% of this increase in
    revenues. Of the remaining 4% increase in net revenues, 2% was
    due to foreign currency fluctuations and 2% was due to core
    revenue growth. Medical Segment core revenue growth in 2008
    reflects higher sales volume for critical care and surgical
    products in Europe and Asia/Latin America of approximately
    $13 million and $8 million, respectively, and a
    $17 million increase in sales of specialty medical devices
    to OEMs, partially offset by $23 million lower sales
    volumes for critical care and surgical products in North America.

Net sales by product group are comprised of the following:

The increase in critical care product sales during 2008 compared
    to 2007 was almost entirely due to the acquisition of Arrow in
    the fourth quarter of 2007, which expanded our vascular access
    and regional anesthesia product lines and contributed an
    incremental $360 million of sales to the critical care
    category in 2008 over 2007. Favorable currency fluctuations
    added $14 million to sales and higher sales of vascular
    access products in Europe contributed another $5 million in
    core revenue growth.

Surgical product sales were essentially flat in 2008 compared to
    2007 as the benefit of favorable foreign currency movements in
    Europe ($6 million) and higher volume in European and
    Asia/Latin American markets ($6 million) was offset by
    $12 million lower volumes in North America. This decline in
    North America was primarily in the chest drainage and
    instrumentation product lines.

Cardiac care product sales increased as a result of the Arrow
    acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2007.



In 2008, sales to OEMs increased primarily as a result of higher
    sales of orthopedic instrumentation, specialty sutures and other
    devices of approximately $17 million and an acquisition in
    the orthopedic product line in early 2007 (approximately
    $3 million).

Operating profit in the Medical Segment increased 57% in 2008 to
    $286.3 million, from $182.6 million in 2007,
    principally due to the addition of higher margin Arrow critical
    care product lines. Other factors that contributed to the higher
    operating profit were improved cost and operational efficiencies
    in North America, higher volumes in Europe and Asia/Latin
    America, lower fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in
    the Arrow acquisition ($7 million in 2008 versus
    $29 million in 2007) and the favorable impact from the
    stronger Euro. The impact of these factors was partially offset
    by the impact of approximately $25 million higher
    amortization expense related to the Arrow acquisition and
    $20 million in higher costs incurred in 2008 in connection
    with a plan to remediate FDA regulatory issues.

Comparison of
    2007 and 2006

Medical Segment net revenues increased 21% in 2007 to
    $1,041.3 million from $858.7 million in 2006, entirely
    due to acquisitions and currency movements. Revenues related to
    the acquisition of Arrow International contributed
    $133.8 million, or 16% of this increase. Increased sales of
    disposable medical products for airway management, respiratory
    care, urology, and surgical devices to European hospital markets
    and to Asian hospital markets, was more than offset by a decline
    in sales of orthopedic specialty devices sold to medical device
    manufacturers, the phase out of some product lines for medical
    device manufacturers and a decline in sales of products for
    alternate sites in North America.

Medical Segment operating profit increased 13% in 2007 to
    $182.6 million from $161.7 million in 2006 primarily
    due to the increase in volume from the Arrow acquisition, the
    positive impact from the full year effect of cost and
    productivity improvements that began in the second half of 2006
    following completion of significant restructuring activities,
    and currency movements, which more than offset the negative
    impact from a $29 million charge in 2007 related to the
    fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the Arrow
    acquisition, which was sold in 2007. During the first half of
    2006, operating profit was negatively impacted by costs
    associated with operational inefficiencies and the consolidation
    of facilities and distribution centers.

Aerospace

Comparison of
    2008 and 2007

Aerospace Segment net revenues grew 13% in 2008 to
    $511.2 million, from $451.8 million in 2007. The
    expansion of the cargo containers product line due to the
    acquisition of Nordisk Aviation Products accounted for 10% of
    this increase. The 2% increase in core growth is primarily
    attributable to increased sales of narrow body cargo loading
    systems and wide body and narrow body cargo spare components and
    repairs.

Segment operating profit increased 32% in 2008 to
    $61.8 million, from $47.0 million in 2007. The
    increase was principally due to the impact of the Nordisk
    acquisition and favorable product mix of repair versus
    replacement in the engine repair services business as a result
    of technology investments we have made. Consolidation of
    operations and phasing out of lower margin product lines in the
    engine repair services business during 2007 also had a positive
    impact on operating profit in 2008.

Comparison of
    2007 and 2006

Aerospace Segment net revenues increased 11% in 2007 to
    $451.8 million from $405.4 million in 2006. This
    increase was due to increases of 7% from core growth, 3% from
    acquisitions and 1% from foreign currency movements. Core growth
    was primarily attributable to increased sales of wide body cargo
    handling systems and narrow body cargo loading systems, combined
    with steady increases in sales volume for aftermarket spares and
    repairs throughout the year.



Aerospace Segment operating profit increased 17% to
    $47.0 million from $40.2 million in 2006 as a result
    of higher volume, productivity improvements, and cost control
    efforts in both the cargo handling systems and engine repair
    businesses, as well as the positive impact of restructuring in
    engine repair services.

Commercial

Comparison of
    2008 and 2007

Commercial Segment net revenues declined approximately 7% in
    2008 to $410.6 million, from $441.2 million in 2007.
    Core revenue declined 9% as a result of a 16% decline in sales
    of marine products for the recreational boat market and a 22%
    decline in sales of auxiliary power units for the North American
    truck market which was partially offset by a 12% increase in
    sales of alternate fuel systems and an 11% increase in sales of
    rigging services products. Extreme volatility in fuel costs,
    accompanied by deterioration in the general state of the global
    economy in the second half of 2008 adversely impacted the
    markets served by our marine and auxiliary power unit products
    and we expect the marine market to remain weak for most, if not
    all, of 2009. As a result, we adjusted production levels and
    took new restructuring actions in response to the current
    environment. Conversely, high fuel prices in 2008 increased
    demand for alternate fuel systems and we successfully penetrated
    a large emerging compressed natural gas market in South America
    during the year.

In 2008, segment operating profit increased 19% to
    $27.5 million compared to $23.0 million in 2007. This
    increase was principally due to favorable product mix and an
    acquisition during 2007 in the rigging services business.
    Favorable currency impact of approximately $3 million, cost
    reductions and lower warranty expenses in the power systems
    business offset the lower operating profit in the marine
    business resulting from lower sales in 2008.

Comparison of
    2007 and 2006

Commercial Segment revenues increased 3% in 2007 to
    $441.2 million from $426.8 million in 2006. The
    favorable impact of acquisitions and foreign currency movements
    and an increase in sales of products for marine markets offset a
    decline in core revenue attributable to a significant decline in
    sales of auxiliary power units in the North American heavy truck
    market and to lower sales of rigging services where unusually
    high demand as a result of U.S. Gulf Coast rebuilding
    activities due to severe weather during 2006 caused unfavorable
    comparisons in 2007.

Commercial Segment operating profit declined 25% in 2007 to
    $23.0 million from $30.5 million in 2006. Operating
    profit was negatively impacted by commodity price increases,
    lower volumes of auxiliary power units and from approximately
    $4 million in provisions for warranty and other costs
    related to prior generation auxiliary power units sold to the
    North American truck market, which more than offset the positive
    impact of cost and productivity improvements in the business
    serving the marine market. Operating profit as a percent of
    revenues declined to 5.2% in 2007 from 7.1% in 2006.

Liquidity and
    Capital Resources

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash
    to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our
    principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. In
    addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that
    affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital
    expenditures, acquisitions, pension funding, dividends, common
    stock repurchases, adequacy of available bank lines of credit,
    and access to other capital markets.

The deterioration in global economic conditions and the severe
    disruptions in global credit markets that occurred during the
    fourth quarter of 2008 affected the operating results of our
    various businesses as described above in “Results of
    Operations.” In assessing the impact of these factors on
    our liquidity, we do not currently foresee any difficulties
    meeting our cash requirements or accessing credit as needed in
    the next twelve months. To date, we have not experienced an
    inordinate amount of payment default by our customers, and we
    have



sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund
    additional operating needs. However, taking into consideration
    current economic conditions, we recognize the increased risk
    that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access
    liquidity. If current market conditions continue to deteriorate,
    we may experience delays in customer payments and reductions in
    our customers’ purchases from us, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our liquidity.

Recent deterioration in the securities markets has impacted the
    value of the assets included in our defined benefit pension
    plans. As a result of losses experienced in global equity
    markets, our domestic pension funds experienced approximately
    $76 million, or 29%, decline in value during 2008. While
    this will increase pension expense in 2009 compared to 2008, we
    do not expect this to cause a significant increase to our
    pension funding requirements for 2009 because amounts funded to
    the plans in prior years exceeded the minimum amounts required
    in those years. The volatility in the securities markets has not
    significantly affected the liquidity of our pension plans or
    counterparty exposure. Substantially all of our domestic pension
    plans are invested in mutual funds registered with the SEC under
    the Investment Company Act of 1940. Underlying holdings of the
    mutual funds are invested in publicly traded equity and fixed
    income securities.

We manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering
    available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we
    conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those
    funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from
    certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences;
    however, those balances are generally available without legal
    restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. We have and
    will continue to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to us and
    to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to
    do so. Substantially all of our debt service requirements are
    United States based and we depend on foreign sources of cash to
    fund a portion of these requirements. We anticipate our domestic
    principal and interest payments for 2009 will be approximately
    $189 million and we expect to access approximately
    $95 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries in 2009 to
    help fund these debt service requirements. To the extent we
    cannot, or choose not to, repatriate cash from foreign
    subsidiaries in time to meet quarterly debt service requirements
    our revolving credit facility is utilized as a source of
    liquidity until such cash can be repatriated in a cost effective
    manner.

We believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and
    cash equivalents, borrowings under our revolving credit facility
    and additional sales of accounts receivable under our
    securitization program will enable us to fund our operating
    requirements, capital expenditures and debt obligations.

A summary of our cash flows for the last three years is as
    follows:

Cash Flow from
    Operating Activities

Higher tax payments of approximately $112 million (net of
    refunds of approximately $27 million) and higher interest
    payments of approximately $60 million were the principal
    factors in the

year-on-year

decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2008
    compared to 2007. The largest factor contributing to the higher
    tax payments is approximately $90 million of taxes paid in
    connection with businesses divested in 2007.



All together, changes in our operating assets and liabilities
    resulted in a decrease in cash from operations of approximately
    $110 million during 2008 which is principally attributable
    to the $90 million of tax payments mentioned previously.
    The cash flow impact from changes in other operating assets and
    liabilities offset one another; an inventory increase of
    approximately $21 million, increase in accounts payable and
    accrued expenses of $8 million, decrease in accounts
    receivable of $3 million, and a decrease in other operating
    assets of $6 million. The ramp up in production of cargo
    handling systems to meet the delivery schedules communicated
    earlier in the year from aircraft manufacturers and the late in
    the year delay of those delivery schedules into 2009 was the
    principal ($14 million) cause of the

year-on-year

increase in inventory. Nearly all of the increase in accounts
    payable and accrued expenses is due to a

year-on-year

increase in accounts payable in the Medical Segment that results
    from changes in payment patterns to suppliers of the Arrow
    operations during 2008 where early payment discounts were
    forgone in favor of longer payment terms. The $3 million
    decrease in accounts receivable reflects focused collection
    efforts in all segments and is in spite of higher sales during
    the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the same period of a year
    ago, and a heavier mix of sales in our cargo handling systems
    business to aircraft manufacturers in 2008 which carry longer
    payment terms compared to the aftermarket side of that business.
    During 2008 we repatriated approximately $104 million of
    cash from our foreign subsidiaries.

Changes in our operating assets and liabilities during 2007
    resulted in a net cash inflow of $76.9 million. The most
    significant change was a decrease in inventories of
    $62.4 million, $25 million of which is due to the
    resolution, in 2007, of operational inefficiencies experienced
    in the Medical Segment during the consolidation of facilities
    and distribution centers in 2005 and 2006 and focused inventory
    reduction initiatives in the Arrow operations post-acquisition,
    and $29 million is the impact from a fair value adjustment
    to inventory acquired in the Arrow acquisition which was sold
    during 2007. During 2007, we repatriated approximately
    $208 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries,
    exclusive of proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations.

Cash Flow from
    Investing Activities

Our cash flows from investing activities from continuing
    operations in 2008 consisted primarily of capital expenditures
    of $39.3 million, $5.7 million of payments for
    businesses acquired that had been deferred at closing, which
    primarily pertained to our acquisitions of Nordisk
    ($4.7 million) and Southern Wire ($1.0 million), an
    additional investment of $2.2 million in our Propulsion
    Technologies joint venture, and proceeds of $8.5 million
    from the sale of assets and investments, principally
    $5.3 million related to post closing adjustments in
    connection with the sale of the GMS business, sale of
    investments in non-consolidated affiliates of $1.8 million
    and the sale of a held for sale building for $1.0 million.

Our cash flows from investing activities from continuing
    operations during 2007 consisted primarily of payments of
    $2.2 billion for businesses acquired, of which
    $2.1 billion pertained to the acquisition of Arrow
    International. During 2007, we received proceeds of
    approximately $702.3 million from the sale of the
    Commercial Segment’s automotive and industrial business and
    the Aerospace Segment’s precision machined components
    business.

Cash Flow from
    Financing Activities

Our cash flows from financing activities from continuing
    operations in 2008 consisted primarily of $133.9 million
    repayment of long-term debt, $92.8 million repayment of
    revolver borrowings, additional borrowings under the revolver of
    $92.9 million, payment of dividends of $53.0 million
    and payments to minority interest shareholders of
    $38.0 million which relate to the distribution of dividends
    from our ATI joint venture.

Our cash flows from financing activities from continuing
    operations during 2007 consisted primarily of new long-term
    borrowings of $1.6 billion in connection with the Arrow
    acquisition, the payment of fees of $21.6 million to obtain
    that debt, and the repayment of $463.4 million of debt. We
    repaid approximately



$54.0 million of debt in connection with the Arrow
    acquisition and repaid approximately $386.6 million of
    long-term debt with the proceeds from the disposal of the
    automotive and industrial businesses.

Cash flows used in discontinued operations of $5.6 million
    in 2008 reflects the settlement of a contingency related to the
    GMS businesses which were sold in 2007.

In connection with the October 2007 acquisition of Arrow, we
    entered into a credit agreement (“the Senior Credit
    Facility”) that provides for a five-year term loan facility
    of $1.4 billion and a five-year revolving line of credit
    facility of $400 million, both of which carried initial
    interest rates of LIBOR plus a spread of 150 basis points.
    The spread is subject to adjustment based upon our leverage
    ratio. At December 31, 2008 the spread over LIBOR was
    125 basis points. We executed an interest rate swap for
    $600 million of the term loan from a floating 3 month
    LIBOR rate to a fixed rate of 4.75%. The notional value of the
    interest rate swap amortizes down to $350 million at
    maturity in 2012. Our obligations under the Senior Credit
    Facility are guaranteed by substantially all of our material
    wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, and are secured by a pledge
    of the shares of certain of our subsidiaries.

Also in connection with our acquisition of Arrow, on
    October 1, 2007, we issued $200 million in new senior
    notes (the “2007 Notes”) and amended certain terms of
    our outstanding notes issued on July 8, 2004 (the
    “2004 Notes”) and October 25, 2002 (the
    “2002 Notes,” and, together with the 2004 Notes, the
    “amended notes”). In addition, we repaid
    $10.5 million of outstanding notes issued on
    November 1, 1992 and December 15, 1993 (collectively,
    the “retired notes”). The retired notes consisted of
    the 7.40% Senior Notes due November 15, 2007 and the
    6.80% Series B Senior Notes due December 15, 2008.

The 2007 notes and the amended notes, referred to collectively
    as the “senior notes”, rank pari passu in right of
    repayment with our obligations under the Senior Credit Facility
    (the “primary bank obligations”) and are secured and
    guaranteed in the same manner as the Senior Credit Facility. The
    senior notes have mandatory prepayment requirements upon the
    sale of certain assets and may be accelerated upon certain
    events of default, in each case, on the same basis as the Senior
    Credit facility.

The interest rates payable on the amended notes were also
    modified in connection with the foregoing transactions.
    Effective as of October 1, 2007:

•

the 2004 Notes bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
    at the following rates: (i) 7.66% in respect of the

Series 2004-1

Tranche A Senior Notes due 2011; (ii) 8.14% in respect
    of the Series



2004-1

Tranche B Senior Notes due 2014; and (iii) 8.46% in
    respect of the

Series 2004-1

Tranche C Senior Notes due 2016; and

•

the 2002 Notes bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
    at the rate of 7.82% per annum.

Interest rates on the amended notes are subject to reduction
    based on positive performance relative to certain financial
    ratios.

Fixed rate borrowings, excluding the effect of derivative
    instruments, comprised 36% of total borrowings at
    December 31, 2008. Fixed rate borrowings, including the
    effect of derivative instruments, comprised 74% of total
    borrowings at December 31, 2008. Approximately 2% of our
    total borrowings of $1,546.4 million are denominated in
    currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the Euro.

The Senior Credit Facility and the senior note agreements
    contain covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict
    our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur debt,
    create liens, consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets,
    make certain investments, engage in acquisitions, pay dividends
    on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock
    and enter into swap agreements. These agreements also require us
    to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (defined in the Senior
    Credit Facility as “Consolidated Leverage Ratio”) and
    an interest coverage ratio (defined in the Senior Credit
    Facility as “Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio”) at
    the levels and as of the last day of any period of four
    consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or nearest to the dates
    set forth in the table below calculated pursuant to the
    definitions and methodology set forth in the Senior Credit
    Facility.

At December 31, 2008, we had $36.8 million of
    borrowings outstanding under our $400 million revolving
    line-of-credit facility. This facility is used principally for
    seasonal working capital needs. The availability of loans under
    this facility is dependent upon our ability to maintain our
    financial condition and our continued compliance with the
    covenants contained in the Senior Credit Facility and senior
    note agreements. Moreover, additional borrowings would be
    prohibited if a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the
    Senior Credit Facility) were to occur. Notwithstanding these
    restrictions, we believe that this revolving credit facility
    provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable
    working capital needs. At our current level of EBITDA (as
    defined in the Senior Credit Facility) for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, we would have been permitted
    $334 million of additional debt beyond the levels
    outstanding at December 31, 2008. In addition, we believe
    that we will continue to have adequate borrowing availability
    under this facility after giving effect to the scheduled
    reduction in the leverage ratio covenant to 3.50:1 at
    September 30, 2009. Notwithstanding the borrowing capacity
    described above, additional capacity would be available if
    borrowed funds were used to acquire a business or businesses
    through the purchase of assets or controlling equity interests
    so long as the ratios set forth in the table above are met after
    giving proforma effect of the EBITDA (as defined in the Senior
    Credit Facility) of the business acquired.



As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all
    other terms of the Senior Credit Facility and the senior notes,
    and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of
    these agreements, including the leverage and interest coverage
    ratios, throughout 2009.

For additional information regarding our indebtedness, please
    see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In addition, at December 31, 2008 the Company had an
    accounts receivable securitization program to sell a security
    interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up
    to $125 million to a commercial paper conduit. This
    facility is utilized from time to time for increased flexibility
    in funding short term working capital requirements. The credit
    market volatility during 2008 did not have a material impact on
    the availability of the accounts receivable securitization
    program. For additional information regarding this facility,
    please refer to “Off Balance Sheet Arrangements”
    included in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Stock Repurchase
    Programs

On June 14, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of
    outstanding Company common stock. Repurchases of Company stock
    under the program may be made from time to time in the open
    market and may include privately-negotiated transactions as
    market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory
    considerations. The program has no expiration date, and the
    Company’s ability to execute on the program will depend on,
    among other factors, cash requirements for acquisitions, cash
    generation from operations, debt repayment obligations, market
    conditions and regulatory requirements. In addition, under the
    senior loan agreements entered into October 1, 2007, the
    Company is subject to certain restrictions relating to its
    ability to repurchase shares in the event the Company’s
    consolidated leverage ratio exceeds certain levels, which
    further limit the Company’s ability to repurchase shares
    under this program. Through December 31, 2008, no shares
    have been purchased under this program.

On July 25, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $140 million of our outstanding common
    stock over twelve months ended July 2006, which was subsequently
    extended by our Board to January 2007. Under this program, we
    repurchased a total of 2,317,347 shares on the open market
    during 2005 and 2006 for an aggregate purchase price of
    $140.0 million, and aggregate fees and commissions of
    $0.1 million.

    December 31, 2008.

(2)

Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods
    or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that
    specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum
    quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable pricing
    provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions. These
    obligations relate primarily to material purchase requirements.



We also have obligations with respect to income tax
    uncertainties and our pension and other postretirement benefit
    plans. See Notes 12 and 13, respectively to our
    consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K

for additional information.

Off Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

We have residual value guarantees under operating leases for
    certain equipment. The maximum potential amount of future
    payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is
    approximately $1.9 million.

We use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain
    access to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs. As
    currently structured, accounts receivable of certain domestic
    subsidiaries are sold on a non-recourse basis to a special
    purpose entity (“SPE”), which is a bankruptcy-remote
    subsidiary of Teleflex Incorporated that is consolidated in our
    financial statements. This SPE then sells undivided interests in
    those receivables to an asset backed commercial paper conduit.
    The conduit issues notes secured by those interests and other
    assets to third party investors.

To the extent that cash consideration is received for the sale
    of undivided interests in the receivables by the SPE to the
    conduit, it is accounted for as a sale in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140,
    “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities”, as we have
    relinquished control of the receivables. Accordingly, undivided
    interests in accounts receivable sold to the commercial paper
    conduit under these transactions are excluded from accounts
    receivables, net in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets. The interests not represented by cash consideration from
    the conduit are retained by the SPE and remain in accounts
    receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The interests in receivables sold and the interest in
    receivables retained by the SPE are carried at face value, which
    is due to the short-term nature of our accounts receivable. The
    special purpose entity has received cash consideration of
    $39.7 million and $39.7 million for the interests in
    the accounts receivable it has sold to the commercial paper
    conduit at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007,
    respectively. No gain or loss is recorded upon sale as fee
    charges from the commercial paper conduit are based upon a
    floating yield rate and the period the undivided interests
    remain outstanding. Fee charges from the commercial paper
    conduit are accrued at the end of each month. Should we default
    under the accounts receivable securitization program, the
    commercial paper conduit is entitled to receive collections on
    receivables owned by the SPE in satisfaction of the amount of
    cash consideration paid to the SPE to the commercial paper
    conduit. The assets of the SPE are not available to satisfy the
    obligations of Teleflex or any of its other subsidiaries.

Information regarding the outstanding balances related to the
    SPE’s interests in accounts receivables sold or retained as
    of December 31, 2008 is as follows:

Other fee charges related to the sale of receivables to the

    2008 were not material.

We continue servicing the receivables sold, pursuant to
    servicing agreements with the SPE. No servicing asset is
    recorded at the time of sale because we do not receive any
    servicing fees from third parties or other income related to the
    servicing of the receivables. We do not record any servicing
    liability at the time of the sale as the receivables collection
    period is relatively short and the costs of servicing the
    receivables sold over the servicing period are insignificant.
    Servicing costs are recognized as incurred over the servicing
    period.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
    at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

We have identified the following as critical accounting
    estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of
    significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive
    and important to the presentation of our financial condition and
    results of operations and could potentially result in materially
    different results under different assumptions and conditions.

Accounting for
    Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

In the ordinary course of business, we grant non-interest
    bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms. In
    an effort to reduce our credit risk, we (i) establish
    credit limits for all of our customer relationships,
    (ii) perform ongoing credit evaluations of our
    customers’ financial condition, (iii) monitor the
    payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables,
    and (iv) monitor open orders against an individual
    customer’s outstanding receivable balance.

An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts
    receivable based on our historical collection experience and
    expected collectability of the accounts receivable, considering
    the period an account is outstanding, the financial position of
    the customer and information provided by credit rating services.
    The adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period
    and adjusted as necessary. Our allowance for doubtful accounts
    was $8.7 million at December 31, 2008 and
    $7.0 million at December 31, 2007 which was 2.6% and
    2.1% of gross accounts receivable, at those respective dates. In
    light of the disruptions in global credit markets that occurred
    in the fourth quarter of 2008 we have taken this heightened risk
    of customer payment default into account when estimating the
    allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2008 by
    engaging in a more robust

customer-by-customer

risk assessment. Although future results cannot always be
    predicted by extrapolating past results, management believes
    that it is reasonably likely that future results will be
    consistent with historical trends and experience. However, if
    the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to
    deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make
    payments, or if unexpected events or significant future changes
    in trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required.

Inventory
    Utilization

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
    Accordingly, we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete
    inventory to reduce the carrying value of our inventories for
    the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence,
    damage or other issues affecting marketability equal to the
    difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated
    market value. Factors utilized in the determination of estimated
    market value



include (i) current sales data and historical return rates,
    (ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive
    pricing pressures, (iv) new product introductions,
    (v) product expiration dates, and (vi) component and
    packaging obsolescence.

The adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period
    and adjusted as necessary. We regularly compare inventory
    quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related
    to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and
    excessive quantities. In assessing historical usage, we also
    qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the
    reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of
    future usage.

Our excess and obsolete inventory reserve was $37.5 million
    at December 31, 2008 and $35.9 million at
    December 31, 2007 which was 8.1% and 7.9% of gross
    inventories, at those respective dates.

Accounting for
    Long-Lived Assets and Investments

The ability to realize long-lived assets is evaluated
    periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible
    inability to recover their carrying amount. Such evaluation is
    based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow
    projections. The analyses necessarily involve significant
    management judgment. Any impairment loss, if indicated, is
    measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
    exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.

Accounting for
    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Acquired intangible assets may represent indefinite-lived assets
    (e.g., certain trademarks or brands), determinable-lived
    intangibles (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer
    relationships, patents and technologies) or residual goodwill.
    Of these, only the costs of determinable-lived intangibles are
    amortized to expense over their estimated life. The value of the
    indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not
    amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our
    impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our
    impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. Goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangibles assets, primarily trademarks and
    brand names, are tested annually for impairment during the
    fourth quarter, using the first day of the quarter as the
    measurement date, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain
    events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the
    carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions may
    include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change
    in the assessment of future operations.

Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the
    impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate
    future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in the
    Company’s impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth
    rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal
    projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and
    estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by
    other marketplace participants.

Goodwill

Impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level.
    For purposes of this assessment, the Company’s reporting
    units are generally its businesses one level below the
    respective operating segment.



Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The
    first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a
    reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. In
    performing the first step, the Company calculated fair values of
    the various reporting units using equal weighting of two
    methods; one which estimates the discounted cash flows
    (“DCF”) of each of the reporting units based on
    projected earnings in the future (the Income Approach) and one
    which is based on sales of similar assets in actual transactions
    (the Market Approach). If the fair value exceeds the carrying
    value, there is no impairment. If the reporting unit carrying
    amount exceeds the fair value, the second step of the goodwill
    impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the
    impairment loss, if any.

Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant
    judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates,
    perpetual growth rates, operating margins, industry trends,
    regulatory environment, relevant comparable company selection,
    calculation of comparable company multiples and the amount and
    timing of expected future cash flows. The DCF analysis utilized
    in the fourth quarter 2008 impairment test was performed over a
    ten year time horizon for each reporting unit where the compound
    annual growth rates during this period for the Medical,
    Aerospace and Commercial segments range from approximately 4% to
    7% for revenue and from approximately 8% to 13% for operating
    income. Discount rates range from 10.5% to 14.0%, and a
    perpetual growth rate of 2.5% was assumed for all reporting
    units.

The cash flows employed in the DCF analyses are based on
    internal budgets and business plans and various long-term growth
    assumptions beyond the business plan period. Discount rate
    assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in
    the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along
    with various market based inputs.

In arriving at our estimate of the fair value of each reporting
    unit, we considered the results of both the DCF and the market
    comparable methods and concluded the fair value to be the
    average of the results yielded by the two methods for each
    reporting unit. Then, the current market capitalization of the
    Company was reconciled to the sum of the estimated fair values
    of the individual reporting units, plus a control premium, to
    ensure the fair value conclusions were reasonable in light of
    current market capitalization. The control premium implied by
    our analysis was approximately 35%, which was deemed to be
    within a reasonable range of observed average industry control
    premiums. No impairment in the carrying value of any of our
    reporting units was evident as a result of the assessment of
    their respective fair values as determined under the methodology
    described above. In light of market conditions in the fourth
    quarter we considered whether there were any triggering events
    which would have caused us to re-assess our goodwill impairment
    considerations as of the assessment date and we determined that
    there were no triggering events.

To illustrate the magnitude of potential impairment charges
    relative to future changes in projected operating income and
    discount rates, the following table shows the sensitivity to 1.0
    and 1.5 percentage point increases in the discount rate or
    a 10% and 25% reduction in the compound annual growth rate of
    operating income:

None of these scenarios resulted in an indication of impairment
    in any of our reporting units. While we are not aware of any
    known trends, uncertainties or other factors that will result
    in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, a material
    impairment charge in the future, events could occur in the
    future which are currently unforeseen that could result in an
    impairment.



Intangible
    Assets

Intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical
    substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition
    apart from goodwill. Intangible assets acquired are comprised
    mainly of technology, customer relationships, and trade names.
    The fair value of acquired technology and trade names is
    estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method, which
    values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved
    through the ownership of an asset. The royalty, which is based
    on a reasonable rate applied against forecasted sales, is
    tax-effected and discounted to present value using a discount
    rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash
    flow. The fair value of acquired customer relationships is
    estimated by the use of an income approach known as the excess
    earnings method. The excess earnings method measures economic
    benefit indirectly by calculating residual profit attributable
    to an asset after appropriate returns are paid to complementary
    or contributory assets. The residual profit is tax-effected and
    discounted to present value at an appropriate discount rate that
    reflects the risk factors associated with the estimated income
    stream. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset
    requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will
    have different useful lives and certain assets may even be
    considered to have indefinite useful lives.

Management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets on at least
    an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary. In connection
    with the analysis, management tests for impairment by comparing
    the carrying value of intangible assets to its estimated fair
    value. Since quoted market prices are seldom available for
    intangible assets, we utilize present value techniques to
    estimate fair value. Common among such approaches is the
    “relief from royalty” methodology. This methodology
    estimates the direct cash flows associated with the intangible
    asset. Management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate,
    discount rate, and residual growth rate to estimate the
    forecasted cash flows associated with the asset.

Discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the
    impairment test of indefinite-lived assets during the fourth
    quarter of 2008 are comparable to the rates utilized in the
    impairment test of goodwill by segment. Compound annual growth
    rates in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade
    names in the Medical Segment ranged from 3.85% to 11.67% and a
    royalty rate of 4.0% was assumed. The compound annual growth
    rate in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade
    names in the Commercial Segment was 5.36% and a royalty rate of
    2.0% was assumed. Discount rate assumptions are based on an
    assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows
    generated as a result of the respective intangible assets.
    Assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which
    similar trademarks or technologies are being licensed in the
    marketplace.

This analysis indicated that certain trade names in the
    Commercial Segment were impaired by $0.8 million and this
    was charged to restructuring and other impairment charges during
    the fourth quarter of 2008. Had the fair value of each
    Company’s indefinite-lived assets been hypothetically lower
    than presently estimated by 10% as of September 29, 2008,
    certain trade names in the Commercial Segment would have been
    impaired by an additional $1.0 million and the Arrow trade
    name would have been impaired $8 million.

Long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets
    (e.g., customer relationships), do not require that an annual
    impairment test be performed; instead, long-lived assets are
    tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event.
    Triggering events include the likely (i.e., more likely than
    not) disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of
    an adverse change in the market involving the business employing
    the related assets. Significant judgments in this area involve
    determining whether a triggering event has occurred and
    re-assessing the reasonableness of the remaining useful lives of
    finite-lived assets by, among other things, validating customer
    attrition rates.

Acquired
    In-Process Research and Development

In connection with the acquisition of Arrow International, the
    Company recorded a $30 million charge to operations during
    2007, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business
    Combinations”, for in-process research and development
    (“IPR&D”) assets acquired that the



Company determined had no alternative future use in their
    current state. The Company continues to evaluate certain of
    these projects for their feasibility and alignment with the
    Company’s core strategic objectives.

As part of the preliminary purchase price allocation for Arrow,
    approximately $30 million of the purchase price was
    allocated to acquire in-process research and development
    projects. The amount allocated to the acquired in-process
    research and development represents the estimated value based on
    risk-adjusted cash flows related to in-process projects that had
    not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative
    future uses as of the date of the acquisition. The primary basis
    for determining the technological feasibility of these projects
    is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying
    products. If the projects are not successful or completed in a
    timely manner, the Company may not realize the financial
    benefits expected for these projects.

The value assigned to the acquired in-process technology was
    determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired
    technology into commercially viable products, estimating the
    resulting net cash flows from the projects, and discounting the
    net cash flows to their present value. The revenue projections
    used to value the acquired in-process research and development
    were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth
    factors, expected trends in technology, and the nature and
    expected timing of new product introductions by us and our
    competitors. The resulting net cash flows from such projects
    were based on our estimates of cost of sales, operating
    expenses, and income taxes from such projects.

The rate of 14 percent utilized to discount the net cash
    flows to their present value was based on estimated cost of
    capital calculations and the implied rate of return from the
    Company’s acquisition model plus a risk premium. Due to the
    nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the
    developmental projects, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates
    were used for the in-process research and development projects.
    The discount rates are based on the stage of completion and
    uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the
    purchased in-process technology projects.

The purchased in-process technology of Arrow relates to research
    and development projects in the following product families:
    Central Venus Access Catheters (“CVC”) and Specialty
    Care Catheters (“Specialty Care”).

The most significant purchased set of in-process technologies
    relates to the CVC Product Family for which the Company
    estimated a value of $25 million. The projects included in
    this product family’s in-process technology include the
    Hi-C Project, PICC Triple Lumen, Antimicrobial PICC, and certain
    Catheter Tip Positioning Technology.

The remaining purchased set of in-process technologies relates
    to the Specialty Care Product Family for which the Company has
    estimated a value of $5 million. The projects included in
    this product family’s in-process technology include the
    Ethanol Lock Program and Antimicrobial CHDC.

The successful development of new products and product
    enhancements is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,
    both known and unknown, including unanticipated delays, access
    to capital, budget overruns, technical problems and other
    difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial
    change in the design, development and commercialization of these
    new products and enhancements, including, for example, changes
    requested by the FDA in connection with pre-market approval
    applications for products or 510(k) notification. Given the
    uncertainties inherent with product development and
    introduction, there can be no assurance that any of the
    Company’s product development efforts will be successful on
    a timely basis or within budget, if at all. The failure of the
    Company to develop new products and product enhancements on a
    timely basis or within budget could harm the Company’s
    results of operations and financial condition. For additional
    risks that may affect the Company’s business and prospects
    following completion of the merger, see “Risk Factors”
    commencing on page 13 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



Accounting for
    Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

We provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired
    employees, including pensions and postretirement healthcare.
    Several statistical and other factors which are designed to
    project future events are used in calculating the expense and
    liability related to these plans. These factors include
    actuarial assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of
    return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates
    and healthcare cost trend rates. We review the actuarial
    assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the
    assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.

The weighted average assumptions for U.S. and foreign plans
    used in determining net benefit cost were as follows:

Product Warranty
    Liability

Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions for the
    repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a
    specified period after the time of the sales. We estimate our
    warranty costs and liability based on a number of factors
    including historical trends of units sold, the status of
    existing claims, recall programs and communication with
    customers. Our estimated product warranty liability was
    $17.1 million and $20.0 million at December 31,
    2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

Our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the
    deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess
    uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize
    estimates. We conduct a broad range of operations around the
    world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous
    international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax
    audits, disputes and potentially litigation, the outcome of
    which is uncertain. Management must make judgments about such
    uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and
    liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
    and recorded using current enacted tax rates, which the Company
    expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those
    temporary differences are recovered or settled. The likelihood
    of a material change in the Company’s expected realization
    of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, its
    ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks,
    final U.S. and foreign tax settlements, and the
    effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various
    relevant jurisdictions. While management believes that its
    judgments and interpretations regarding



income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual
    experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and
    liabilities and such adjustments could be material.

We are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred
    tax assets. We evaluate all positive and negative evidence and
    use judgments regarding past and future events, including
    operating results and available tax planning strategies that
    could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets to help
    determine when it is more likely than not that all or some
    portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized. Based on
    this assessment, we evaluate the need for, and amount of,
    valuation allowances to offset future tax benefits that may not
    be realized. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the
    future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of
    $51.2 million and $68.5 million at December 31,
    2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, relates
    principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain
    deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards
    in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate
    sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits
    related to the remaining net deferred tax asset. The valuation
    allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,”
    which requires that a valuation allowance be established and
    maintained when it is “more likely than not” that all
    or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
    valuation allowance decrease in 2008 was principally
    attributable to: (i) the deconsolidation of a subsidiary;
    (ii) the increased ability to utilize certain state net
    operating losses as a result of the mergers of several
    subsidiaries; and (iii) the increased ability to utilize
    certain state net operating losses as a result of a shift in
    state apportionment factors following the GMS transaction.

Significant judgment is required in determining income tax
    provisions under SFAS No. 109 “Accounting for Income
    Taxes” and in evaluating tax positions. We establish
    additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief
    that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain
    positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, as
    defined by FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — An
    Interpretation of FASB Statement 109”
    (“FIN 48”), which is a tax position that is more
    likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the
    applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business,
    the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various
    Federal, State and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess
    the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future
    examinations for the current or prior years in determining the
    adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually
    assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and
    adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and
    deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise
    to a revision become known.

See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information regarding the Company’s
    uncertain tax positions.

Accounting
    Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted

Fair Value Measurements:

In September 2006,
    the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 establishes a common
    definition of fair value to be applied to US GAAP that requires
    the use of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value, and expands disclosure about such fair value
    measurements. Except as noted below, SFAS No. 157
    became effective for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

157-2,

“Partial Deferral of the Effective Date of Statement
    157.”

FSP 157-2

delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The Company
    adopted SFAS No. 157 as of January 1, 2008 with
    respect to financial assets and financial liabilities. As of



January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 with respect to non-financial assets and
    liabilities under

FSP 157-2

and this adoption did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows.

In October 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 157-3,

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset is Not Active.”

FSP 157-3

clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in a market
    that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key
    considerations in determining the fair value of a financial
    asset when the market for that financial asset is not active.

FSP 157-3

became effective upon issuance and did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s fair value of financial assets as a
    result of the adoption of

FSP 157-3.

Refer to Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements
    in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information on fair value measurements.

Business Combinations:

In December 2007, the
    FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), “Business
    Combinations”. SFAS No. 141(R) replaces
    SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.”
    SFAS No. 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements
    in Statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting
    (which Statement 141 called the

purchase method

) be used
    for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be
    identified for each business combination.
    SFAS No. 141(R) defines the acquirer as the entity
    that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business
    combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date
    that the acquirer achieves control.
    SFAS No. 141(R)’s scope is broader than that of
    Statement 141, which applied only to business combinations in
    which control was obtained by transferring consideration.

SFAS No. 141(R) replaces Statement 141’s
    cost-allocation process and requires an acquirer to recognize
    the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date,
    measured at their fair values as of that date, with limited
    exceptions. In addition, SFAS No. 141(R) changes the
    allocation and treatment of acquisition-related costs,
    restructuring costs that the acquirer expected but was not
    obligated to incur, the recognition of assets and liabilities
    assumed arising from contingencies and the recognition and
    measurement of goodwill. This statement is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008 and is to be
    applied prospectively to business combinations. Accordingly, the
    Company will apply the provisions of SFAS No. 141(R)
    upon adoption on its effective date.

Noncontrolling Interests:

In December 2007,
    the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an
    amendment of ARB No. 51.” SFAS No. 160
    amends Accounting Research Bulletin (“ARB”) 51 to
    establish accounting and reporting standards for the
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, sometimes referred to
    as minority interest, and for the deconsolidation of a
    subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a
    subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity
    that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial
    statements. SFAS No. 160 requires that a
    noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries held by parties other
    than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and presented in
    the consolidated statement of financial position within equity,
    but separate from the parent’s equity, that the amount of
    consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the
    noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on
    the face of the consolidated statement of income, that the
    changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent
    retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be
    accounted for consistently as equity transactions and that when
    a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling
    equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured
    at fair value. This statement is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption is
    prohibited. Accordingly, the Company will apply the provisions
    of SFAS No. 160 upon adoption on its effective date.

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities:

In March 2008, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 161 “Disclosures about Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities — an amendment of
    FASB Statement No. 133,” which requires enhanced
    disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. Companies
    will be required to provide enhanced disclosures about
    (a) how and why a company uses derivative instruments,
    (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
    accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and related
    interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and
    related hedged items affect the company’s financial
    position, financial performance, and cash flows.
    SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal



and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008.
    Accordingly, the Company will ensure that it meets the enhanced
    disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 161 upon the
    effective date.

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities:

In June
    2008, the FASB issued FSP

EITF 03-6-1

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities,” which
    addresses whether unvested instruments granted in share-based
    payment transactions that contain nonforfeitable rights to
    dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities
    subject to the two-class method of computing earnings per share
    under SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share.”
    FSP

EITF 03-6-1

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods
    within those years. The Company is currently evaluating the
    guidance under FSP

EITF 03-6-1

but does not expect it will result in a change in the
    Company’s earnings per share or diluted earnings per share.

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets:

In
    April 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets,” which amends SFAS No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
    (SFAS No. 142), regarding the factors that should be
    considered in developing the useful lives for intangible assets
    with renewal or extension provisions. FSP

FAS 142-3

requires an entity to consider its own historical experience in
    renewing or extending similar arrangements, regardless of
    whether those arrangements have explicit renewal or extension
    provisions, when determining the useful life of an intangible
    asset. In the absence of such experience, an entity shall
    consider the assumptions that market participants would use
    about renewal or extension, adjusted for entity-specific
    factors. FSP

FAS 142-3

will be effective for qualifying intangible assets acquired by
    the Company on or after January 1, 2009. The application of
    FSP

FAS 142-3

did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of
    operations, cash flows or financial position upon adoption;
    however, future transactions entered into by the Company will
    need to be evaluated under the requirements of this FSP.

FASB Accounting Standards Codification:

In
    December 2008, the FASB issued a news release for the expected
    launch of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The
    Codification is a major restructuring of accounting and
    reporting standards. The Codification does not change GAAP, but
    instead, it introduces a new structure. It will supersede all
    accounting standards in existing FASB, Emerging Issues Task
    Force (EITF), American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
    (AICPA) and related standards. The Codification is expected to
    become authoritative on July 1, 2009, at which time only
    two levels of US GAAP will exist: authoritative represented by
    the Codification, and nonauthoritative represented by all other
    literature.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP
    FAS No. 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures
    about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets” (FSP
    FAS 132(R)-1), which requires additional disclosures for
    employers’ pension and other postretirement benefit plan
    assets. As pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets
    were not included within the scope of SFAS No. 157,
    FSP FAS 132(R)-1 requires employers to disclose information
    about fair value measurements of plan assets similar to the
    disclosures required under SFAS No. 157, the
    investment policies and strategies for the major categories of
    plan assets, and significant concentrations of risk within plan
    assets. FSP FAS 132(R)-1 will be effective for the Company
    as of December 31, 2009. As FSP FAS 132(R)-1 provides
    only disclosure requirements, the adoption of this standard will
    not have a material impact on the Company’s results of
    operations, cash flows or financial positions.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market
    Risk

We are exposed to certain financial risks, specifically
    fluctuations in market interest rates, foreign currency exchange
    rates and, to a lesser extent, commodity prices. We use
    derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact
    of some of these risks. All instruments are entered into for
    other than trading purposes. We are also exposed to changes in
    the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the
    valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings.



Interest Rate
    Risk

We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our
    borrowing activities and our cash balances. Interest rate swaps
    are used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk. The
    table below is an analysis of the amortization and related
    interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable
    rate debt obligations. Variable interest rates shown below are
    weighted average rates of the debt portfolio based on
    December 31, 2008 rates. For the swaps, notional amounts
    and related interest rates are shown by year of maturity. The
    fair value, net of tax, of the interest rate swap as of
    December 31, 2008 was a loss of $27.0 million.

The all in cost of the $600 million swapped debt is 4.75%
    plus the applicable spread over LIBOR, currently at
    125 basis points.

A 1.0% change in variable interest rates would adversely or
    positively impact our expected net earnings by approximately
    $2.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Foreign Currency
    Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in market values of transactions
    in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain
    subsidiaries. We have entered into forward contracts with
    several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of
    projected cash flows from these exposures. These are all
    contracts to buy or sell a foreign currency against the
    U.S. dollar. The fair value of the open forward contracts
    as of December 31, 2008 was a loss of $5 million. The
    following table presents our open forward currency contracts as
    of December 31, 2008, which mature in 2009. Forward
    contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the
    stated currencies (in thousands). The total notional amount for
    all contracts translates to approximately $99.6 million.

A strengthening of 10% in the value of the U.S. dollar
    against foreign currencies would, on a combined basis, adversely
    impact the translation of our non-US subsidiary net earnings and
    transactions on currencies other than the functional currency of
    certain subsidiaries by approximately $1.6 million, for the
    year ended December 31, 2009.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
    of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
    period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
    that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
    period covered by this report are functioning effectively to
    provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be
    disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to
    our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute
    assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system
    are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
    any, within a company have been detected.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Teleflex Incorporated and its subsidiaries
    (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
    Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
    expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
    and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
    the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
    the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, management
    used the framework established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). As a result of this assessment and based on the criteria
    in the COSO framework, management has concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2008, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears
    herein.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Teleflex
    Incorporated:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of Teleflex Incorporated and its
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and December 31,
    2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects,
    the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
    the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these
    financial statements and financial statement schedule, for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report
    on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, appearing on

page F-2.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note 1 — Summary
    of significant accounting policies

Consolidation:

The consolidated financial
    statements include the accounts of Teleflex Incorporated and its
    subsidiaries (the “Company”). Also, in accordance with
    FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46(R),
    “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” the
    Company consolidates variable interest entities in which it
    bears a majority of the risk of the potential losses or gains
    from a majority of the expected returns. Intercompany
    transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in
    affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but
    not a controlling equity interest are carried on the equity
    basis. Investments in affiliates over which the Company does not
    have significant influence are accounted for by the cost method.
    These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America and include management’s estimates
    and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents:

All highly liquid
    debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or
    less are classified as cash equivalents. The carrying value of
    cash equivalents approximates their current market value.

Accounts receivable:

Accounts receivable
    represents amounts due from customers related to the sale of
    products and provision of services. An allowance for doubtful
    accounts is maintained and represents the Company’s
    estimate of probable losses on realization of the full
    receivable. The allowance is provided at such time that
    management believes reasonable doubt exists that such balances
    will be collected within a reasonable period of time. The
    allowance is based on the Company’s historical experience,
    the period an account is outstanding, the financial position of
    the customer and information provided by credit rating services.
    The allowance for doubtful accounts was $8.7 million and
    $7.0 million as of December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007, respectively.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at the
    lower of cost or market. The cost of the Company’s
    inventories is determined by the

“first-in,

first-out” method for catheter and related product
    inventories and by the average cost method for other inventory
    categories. Elements of cost in inventory include raw materials,
    direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. In estimating market
    value, the Company evaluates inventory for excess and obsolete
    quantities based on estimated usage and sales.

Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant
    and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated
    depreciation. Costs incurred to develop internal-use computer
    software during the application development stage generally are
    capitalized. Costs of enhancements to internal-use computer
    software are capitalized, provided that these enhancements
    result in additional functionality. Other additions and those
    improvements which increase the capacity or lengthen the useful
    lives of the assets are also capitalized. With minor exceptions,
    straight-line composite lives for depreciation of property,
    plant and equipment are as follows: land
    improvements — 5 years; buildings —
    30 years

;

machinery and equipment — 3 to
    10 years; computer equipment and software — 3 to
    5 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the
    remaining lease periods. Repairs and maintenance costs are
    expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and other intangible assets:

Goodwill
    and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not
    amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or
    more frequently if events or changes in

F-8


TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Impairment losses, if any, are recorded as part of
    income from operations. The goodwill impairment test is applied
    to each of the Company’s reporting units. For purposes of
    this assessment, a reporting unit is the operating segment, or a
    business one level below that operating segment (the component
    level) if discrete financial information is prepared and
    regularly reviewed by segment management. However, components
    are aggregated as a single reporting unit if they have similar
    economic characteristics. The goodwill impairment test is
    applied using a two-step approach. In performing the first step,
    the Company calculated fair values of the various reporting
    units using equal weighting of two methods; one which estimates
    the discounted cash flows (“DCF”) of each of the
    reporting units based on projected earnings in the future (the
    Income Approach) and one which is based on sales of similar
    assets in actual transactions (the Market Approach). If the
    reporting unit carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the
    second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to
    measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. In the second
    step, the implied fair value of the goodwill is estimated as the
    fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step less the
    fair values of all net tangible and intangible assets of the
    reporting unit other than goodwill. If the carrying amount of
    the goodwill exceeds its implied fair market value, an
    impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess,
    not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill. For other
    indefinite lived intangible assets, the impairment test consists
    of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets to
    their carrying amounts.

The Company performs its annual impairment test of its recorded
    goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth
    quarter each year unless interim indications of impairment
    exist. In 2008, following the process described in the preceding
    paragraph, certain trade names in the Commercial Segment were
    determined to be impaired by $0.8 million. In 2007, an
    impairment charge of $18.9 million was made to goodwill.

Intangible assets consisting of intellectual property, customer
    lists and distribution rights are being amortized over their
    estimated useful lives, which are as follows: intellectual
    property 3 to 20 years, customer lists 5 to 30 years,
    distribution rights 3 to 22 years. The weighted average
    amortization period is 15 years. Tradenames of
    $326 million are considered indefinite lived. The Company
    continually evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of
    these assets. During 2007, the company terminated certain
    contractual relationships that resulted in an impairment charge
    of $2.5 million which is included in restructuring and
    other impairment charges.

Long-lived assets:

The ability to realize
    long-lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or
    circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their
    carrying amount. Such evaluation is based on various analyses,
    including undiscounted cash flow and profitability projections
    that incorporate, as applicable, the impact on the existing
    business. The analyses necessarily involve significant
    management judgment. Any impairment loss, if indicated, is
    measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
    exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.

Product warranty liability:

Product warranty
    liability arises out of the need to repair or replace product
    without charge to the customer. The Company warrants such
    products from manufacturing defect. The Company estimates its
    warranty liability based on historical trends of units sold, the
    status of existing claims, recall programs and communication
    with customers.

Foreign currency translation:

Assets and
    liabilities of non-domestic subsidiaries denominated in local
    currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of
    exchange at the balance sheet date; income and expenses are
    translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during
    the year. The resultant translation adjustments are reported as
    a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
    shareholders’ equity.

Derivative financial instruments:

The Company
    uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of
    hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. All instruments are

F-9


TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

entered into for other than trading purposes. All derivatives
    are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in
    the fair value of derivatives are recorded in earnings or other
    comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is
    designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type
    of hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments
    reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to
    earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the
    underlying hedged item. The ineffective portion of all hedges is
    recognized in current period earnings. If the hedging
    relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes
    probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur,
    gains or losses on the derivative are recorded in current period
    earnings.

Share-based compensation:

The Company
    estimates the fair value of share-based awards on the date of
    grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of
    the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as
    expense over the requisite service periods. Share-based
    compensation expense is measured using a multiple point
    Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account
    highly subjective and complex assumptions. The expected life of
    options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award,
    as well as historical exercise behavior, and represents the
    period of time that options granted are expected to be
    outstanding. Expected volatilities are based on a blend of
    historical volatility and implied volatility derived from
    publicly traded options to purchase the Company’s common
    stock, which the Company believes is more reflective of the
    market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility
    than solely using historical volatility. The risk-free interest
    rate is the implied yield currently available on
    U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term
    equal to the expected life of the option.

Share-based compensation expense for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
    $8.7 million, $7.5 million and $6.8 million,
    respectively and is included in selling, engineering and
    administrative expenses. The total income tax benefit recognized
    for share-based compensation arrangements for 2008, 2007 and
    2006 was $2.1 million, $1.5 million and
    $1.4 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, unamortized share-based
    compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, net of
    expected forfeitures, was $4.7 million, which is expected
    to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    1.75 years. Unamortized share-based compensation cost
    related to non-vested shares (restricted stock), net of expected
    forfeitures, was $6.1 million, which is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.

Share-based compensation expense recognized during a period is
    based on the value of the portion of stock-based awards that is
    ultimately expected to vest during the period less estimated
    forfeitures. Share-based compensation expense recognized in
    2006, 2007 and 2008 included compensation expense for
    (1) share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested
    as of December 25, 2005, based on the fair value on the
    grant date estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions
    of SFAS No. 123 and (2) share-based awards
    granted subsequent to December 25, 2005, based on the fair
    value on the grant date estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123(R).
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated
    at the time of grant. Management reviews and revises the
    estimate of forfeitures for all share-based awards on a
    quarterly basis based on management’s expectation of the
    awards that will ultimately vest to minimize fluctuations in
    share-based compensation expense. In 2008, the Company issued
    164,818 non-vested shares (restricted stock) the majority of
    which vest in three years (cliff vesting).

Income taxes:

The provision for income taxes
    is determined using the asset and liability approach of
    accounting for income taxes in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
    Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax
    consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for
    income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the
    current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
    Deferred taxes result from

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

differences between the financial and tax bases of the
    Company’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for
    changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted.
    Provision has been made for income taxes on unremitted earnings
    of subsidiaries and affiliates, except for subsidiaries in which
    earnings are deemed to be permanently re-invested.

Significant judgment is required in determining income tax
    provisions under SFAS No. 109 and in evaluating tax
    positions. We establish additional provisions for income taxes
    when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully
    supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the
    minimum probability threshold, as defined by FASB Interpretation
    (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes — An Interpretation of FASB Statement
    109” (“FIN 48”), which is a tax position
    that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by
    the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of
    business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by
    various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities. We regularly
    assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any
    future examinations for the current or prior years in
    determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
    Interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and income
    tax related penalties are both included in taxes on income from
    continuing operations. We continually assess the likelihood and
    amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax
    provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the
    period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become
    known.

Pensions and other postretirement
    benefits:

The Company provides a range of
    benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including
    pensions and postretirement healthcare. The Company records
    annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations
    which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount
    rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, compensation
    increases, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. The
    Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and
    makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates
    and trends when appropriate. As required, the effect of the
    modifications is generally amortized over future periods.

Restructuring costs:

Restructuring costs,
    which include termination benefits, facility closure costs,
    contract termination costs and other restructuring costs are
    recorded at estimated fair value. Key assumptions in calculating
    the restructuring costs include the terms that may be negotiated
    to exit certain contractual obligations and the timing of
    employees leaving the company.

Revenue recognition:

The Company recognizes
    revenues from product sales, including sales to distributors, or
    services provided when the following revenue recognition
    criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the
    selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is
    reasonably assured. This generally occurs when products are
    shipped, when services are rendered or upon customers’
    acceptance.

Revenues from product sales, net of estimated returns and other
    allowances based on historical experience and current trends,
    are recognized upon shipment of products to customers or
    distributors. Net revenues from services provided are recognized
    as the services are rendered and comprised 6.5%, 9.9% and 10.7%
    of net revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Company considers the criteria presented in
    SFAS No. 48, “Revenue Recognition When Right of
    Return Exists,” in determining the appropriate revenue
    recognition treatment. The Company’s normal policy is to
    accept returns only in cases in which the product is defective
    and covered under the Company’s standard warranty
    provisions. However, in the limited cases where an arrangement
    provides a right of return to the customer, including a
    distributor, the Company believes it has the ability to
    reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on its
    substantial historical experience with respect to these
    arrangements. The Company accrues any costs or losses that may
    be expected in connection with any returns in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5,

F-11

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

“Accounting for Contingencies.” Revenues and
    materials, labor and other product costs are reduced to reflect
    estimated returns.

The Company applies the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”) Issue

No. 01-09,

“Accounting for Consideration Given from a Vendor to a
    Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s
    Products),” to its customer incentive programs, which
    include discounts or rebates. Appropriate allowances are
    determined and recorded as a reduction of revenue.

Reclassifications:

Certain reclassifications
    have been made to the prior years’ consolidated financial
    statements to conform to current year presentation including the
    reclassification of $41.8 million of borrowings under the
    revolving credit agreement from current borrowings to long-term
    borrowings. Certain financial information is presented on a
    rounded basis, which may cause minor differences.

Note 2 — New
    accounting standards

Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements:

In
    March 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) ratified the consensus reached by the
    Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) for Issue

06-10

“Accounting for Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life
    Insurance Arrangements.”

EITF 06-10

provides guidance for determining when a liability exists for
    the postretirement benefit obligation as well as recognition and
    measurement of the associated asset on the basis of the terms of
    the collateral assignment agreement. The Company adopted the
    requirements of

EITF 06-10

on January 1, 2008, as a change in accounting principle
    through a cumulative-effect adjustment that reduced retained
    earnings by approximately $1.9 million. The adjustment was
    determined by assessing the future cash flows of the premiums
    that were paid to date as of December 31, 2007 that the
    Company is entitled to recover under the split-dollar life
    insurance arrangements, resulting in a reduction of other assets
    by $1.9 million. The Company stopped making premium
    payments on these policies in 2003. In the fourth quarter of
    2008, the Company resumed making premium payments for one of the
    five participants under these programs and recorded a liability
    of $0.3 million.

Fair Value Measurements:

In September 2006,
    the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 establishes a common
    definition of fair value to be applied to US GAAP that requires
    the use of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value, and expands disclosure about such fair value
    measurements. Except as noted below, SFAS No. 157
    became effective for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

157-2,

“Partial Deferral of the Effective Date of Statement
    157.”

FSP 157-2

delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The Company
    adopted SFAS No. 157 as of January 1, 2008 with
    respect to financial assets and financial liabilities. As of
    January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 with respect to non-financial assets and
    liabilities under

FSP 157-2

and this adoption did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows.

In October 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 157-3,

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset is Not Active.”

FSP 157-3

clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in a market
    that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key
    considerations in determining the fair value of a financial
    asset when the market for that financial asset is not active.

FSP 157-3

became effective upon issuance and did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s fair value of financial assets as a
    result of the adoption of

FSP 157-3.

Refer to Note 14 for additional information on fair value
    measurements.

Fair Value Option:

In February 2007, the FASB
    issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — including
    an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115,” which permits
    an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial
    liabilities at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
    reported in earnings at each subsequent measurement date. The
    fair value option may be elected on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis, as long as it is applied to the instrument in its
    entirety. The fair value option election is irrevocable, unless
    an event specified in SFAS No. 159 occurs that results
    in a new election date. This statement is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company
    adopted SFAS No. 159 as of January 1, 2008 and
    has elected not to measure any additional financial instruments
    and other items at fair value.

Business Combinations:

In December 2007, the
    FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), “Business
    Combinations”. SFAS No. 141(R) replaces
    SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.”
    SFAS No. 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements
    in Statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting
    (which Statement 141 called the

purchase method

) be used
    for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be
    identified for each business combination.
    SFAS No. 141(R) defines the acquirer as the entity
    that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business
    combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date
    that the acquirer achieves control.
    SFAS No. 141(R)’s scope is broader than that of
    Statement 141, which applied only to business combinations in
    which control was obtained by transferring consideration.

SFAS No. 141(R) replaces Statement 141’s
    cost-allocation process and requires an acquirer to recognize
    the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date,
    measured at their fair values as of that date, with limited
    exceptions. In addition, SFAS No. 141(R) changes the
    allocation and treatment of acquisition-related costs,
    restructuring costs that the acquirer expected but was not
    obligated to incur, the recognition of assets and liabilities
    assumed arising from contingencies and the recognition and
    measurement of goodwill. This statement is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008 and is to be
    applied prospectively to business combinations. Accordingly, the
    Company will apply the provisions of SFAS No. 141(R)
    upon adoption on its effective date.

Noncontrolling Interests:

In December 2007,
    the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an
    amendment of ARB No. 51.” SFAS No. 160
    amends Accounting Research Bulletin (“ARB”) 51 to
    establish accounting and reporting standards for the
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, sometimes referred to
    as minority interest, and for the deconsolidation of a
    subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a
    subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity
    that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial
    statements. SFAS No. 160 requires that a
    noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries held by parties other
    than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and presented in
    the consolidated statement of financial position within equity,
    but separate from the parent’s equity, that the amount of
    consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the
    noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on
    the face of the consolidated statement of income, that the
    changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent
    retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be
    accounted for consistently as equity transactions and that when
    a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling
    equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured
    at fair value. This statement is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption is
    prohibited. Accordingly, the Company will apply the provisions
    of SFAS No. 160 upon adoption on its effective date.

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities:

In March 2008, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 161 “Disclosures about Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities — an amendment of
    FASB Statement No. 133,” which requires enhanced
    disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. Companies
    will be required to provide enhanced disclosures about
    (a) how and why a company uses derivative instruments,
    (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
    accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and related

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and
    related hedged items affect the company’s financial
    position, financial performance, and cash flows.
    SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal and interim periods beginning after
    November 15, 2008. Accordingly, the Company will ensure
    that it meets the enhanced disclosure provisions of
    SFAS No. 161 upon the effective date.

Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles:

In May 2008, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 162 “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles,” which has been established by the
    FASB as a framework for entities to identify the sources of
    accounting principles and for selecting the principles to be
    used in the preparation of financial statements of
    nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with
    US GAAP. SFAS No. 162 became effective on
    November 15, 2008, 60 days after the Securities and
    Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) approved the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board’s (“PCAOB”)
    amendments to AU Section 411, “The Meaning of Present
    Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles.” The Company adopted SFAS No. 162
    upon the statement’s effective date.

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating
    Securities:

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP

EITF 03-6-1

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities,” which
    addresses whether unvested instruments granted in share-based
    payment transactions that contain nonforfeitable rights to
    dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities
    subject to the two-class method of computing earnings per share
    under SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share.”
    FSP

EITF 03-6-1

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods
    within those years. The Company is currently evaluating the

but does not expect it will result in a change in the
    Company’s earnings per share or diluted earnings per share.

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets:

In April 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets,” which amends SFAS No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
    (SFAS No. 142), regarding the factors that should be
    considered in developing the useful lives for intangible assets
    with renewal or extension provisions. FSP

FAS 142-3

requires an entity to consider its own historical experience in
    renewing or extending similar arrangements, regardless of
    whether those arrangements have explicit renewal or extension
    provisions, when determining the useful life of an intangible
    asset. In the absence of such experience, an entity shall
    consider the assumptions that market participants would use
    about renewal or extension, adjusted for entity-specific
    factors. FSP

FAS 142-3

will be effective for qualifying intangible assets acquired by
    the Company on or after January 1, 2009. The application of
    FSP

FAS 142-3

did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of
    operations, cash flows or financial position upon adoption;
    however, future transactions entered into by the Company will
    need to be evaluated under the requirements of this FSP.

Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers
    of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest
    Entities:

In December 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8, “Disclosures by Public Entities
    (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests
    in Variable Interest Entities”. This FSP amends FASB
    Statement No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities,” and amends FASB Interpretation No. 46
    (revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities”, to require public entities
    (enterprises) to provide additional disclosures that are
    intended to provide greater transparency to financial statement
    users about a transferor’s continuing involvement with
    transferred financial assets and an enterprise’s
    involvement with variable interest entities and qualifying SPEs.

FSP 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8 is effective for the first reporting period
    (interim or annual) ending after December 15, 2008,
    accordingly the Company has adopted the disclosure requirements
    of

FSP 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8 beginning in its annual reporting period
    ending December 31, 2008. Refer to Note 15 for

Note 3 — Acquisitions

Acquisition of
    Arrow International, Inc.

On October 1, 2007, the Company acquired all of the
    outstanding capital stock of Arrow International, Inc.
    (“Arrow”) for approximately $2.1 billion. Arrow
    is a global provider of catheter-based access and therapeutic
    products for critical and cardiac care. The transaction was
    financed with cash, borrowings under a new senior secured
    syndicated bank loan and proceeds received through the issuance
    of privately placed notes. The results of operations for Arrow
    are included in the Company’s Medical Segment from the date
    of acquisition.

Under the terms of the transaction, the Company paid $45.50 per
    common share in cash, or $2,094.6 million in total, to
    acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Arrow. In
    addition, the Company paid $39.1 million in cash for
    outstanding stock options of Arrow. Pursuant to the terms of the
    agreement, upon the change in control of Arrow, Arrow’s
    outstanding stock options became fully vested and exercisable
    and were cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an
    amount for each share subject to the stock option, equal to the
    excess of $45.50 per share over the exercise price per share of
    each option. The aggregate purchase price of
    $2,104.0 million includes transaction costs of
    approximately $10.8 million.

In conjunction with the acquisition of Arrow, the Company repaid
    approximately $35.1 million of debt, representing
    substantially all of Arrow’s existing outstanding debt as
    of October 1, 2007.

The Company financed the all cash purchase price and related
    transaction costs associated with the Arrow acquisition, and the
    repayment of substantially all of Arrow’s outstanding debt
    with $1,672.0 million from borrowings under a new senior
    secured syndicated bank loan and proceeds received through the
    issuance of privately placed notes (see Note 8
    “Borrowings”) and cash on hand of approximately
    $433.5 million.

The acquisition of Arrow was accounted for under the purchase
    method of accounting. As such, the cost to acquire Arrow was
    allocated to the respective assets and liabilities acquired
    based on their preliminary estimated fair values as of the
    closing date.

The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation of
    the cost to acquire Arrow based on the fair values as of
    October 1, 2007:

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Certain assets acquired in the Arrow merger qualify for
    recognition as intangible assets apart from goodwill in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 141, “Business Combinations”. The estimated
    fair value of intangible assets acquired included customer
    related intangibles of $497.7 million, trade names of
    $249.0 million and purchased technology of
    $153.4 million. Customer related intangibles have a useful
    life of 25 years and purchased technology have useful lives
    ranging from 7-15 years. Trade names have an indefinite
    useful life. A portion of the purchase price allocation,
    $30 million, representing in-process research and
    development was deemed to have no future alternative use and was
    charged to expense as of the date of the combination. Goodwill
    is not deductible for tax purposes.

The amount of the purchase price allocated to the acquired
    in-process research and development represents the estimated
    value based on risk-adjusted cash flows related to in-process
    projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and
    have no alternative future uses as of the date of the
    acquisition. The primary basis for determining the technological
    feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval
    to market the underlying products. If the products are not
    successful or completed in a timely manner, the Company may not
    realize the financial benefits expected for these projects.

The value assigned to the acquired in-process technology was
    determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired
    technology into commercially viable products, estimating the
    resulting net cash flows from the projects, and discounting the
    net cash flows to their present value. The revenue projections
    used to value the acquired in-process research and development
    was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth
    factors, expected trends in technology, and the nature and
    expected timing of new product introductions by us and our
    competitors. The resulting net cash flows from such projects
    were based on our estimates of cost of sales, operating
    expenses, and income taxes from such projects.

The rate of 14 percent utilized to discount the net cash
    flows to their present value was based on estimated cost of
    capital calculations and the implied rate of return from the
    Company’s acquisition model plus a risk premium. Due to the
    nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the
    developmental projects, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates
    were used for the in-process research and development projects.
    The discount rates are based on the stage of completion and
    uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the
    purchased in-process technology projects.

The purchased in-process technology of Arrow relates to research
    and development projects in the following product families:
    Central Venus Access Catheters (“CVC”) and Specialty
    Care Catheters (“Specialty Care”).

The most significant purchased set of in-process technologies
    relates to the CVC Product Family for which the Company has
    estimated a value of $25 million. The projects included in
    this product family’s in-process technology include the
    Hi-C Project, PICC Triple Lumen, Antimicrobial PICC, and certain
    Catheter Tip Positioning Technology.

The remaining purchased set of in-process technologies relates
    to the Specialty Care Product Family for which the Company has
    estimated a value of $5 million. The projects included in
    this product family’s in-process technology include the
    Ethanol Lock Program and Antimicrobial CHDC.

The Company continues to evaluate certain of these projects for
    their feasibility and alignment with the Company’s core
    strategic objectives.

    acquisition of Arrow related to the Company’s repatriation
    of cash from foreign subsidiaries. See Note 12 —
    Income taxes for more information concerning the repatriation of
    cash.

Integration of
    Arrow

In connection with the acquisition of Arrow, the Company
    formulated a plan related to the future integration of Arrow and
    the Company’s Medical businesses. The integration plan
    focuses on the closure of Arrow corporate functions and the
    consolidation of manufacturing, sales, marketing, and
    distribution functions in North America, Europe and Asia. The
    Company finalized its estimate of the costs to implement the
    plan in the fourth quarter of 2008, which resulted in a net
    $8.5 million reduction of the costs to implement the plan
    that was charged to goodwill and changed the allocation of the
    purchase price. The reduction in the reserve principally
    resulted from the Company’s ability to re-negotiate certain
    foreign distribution agreements that were originally deemed to
    be contract termination costs, fewer people taking relocation
    packages than was originally estimated, lower employee and lease
    termination costs and an overall finalization of the plan for
    amounts different than originally estimated. In some instances,
    the Company changed the focus of the original plan from an Arrow
    facility to a Teleflex facility which resulted in an increase in
    future estimated restructuring expenses (see Note 4
    “Restructuring”).

The Company recognized an aggregate amount of $31.6 million
    as a liability assumed in the acquisition of Arrow, and included
    in the allocation of the purchase price, for the estimated costs
    to carry out the integration plan. Of this amount,
    $18.4 million related to employee termination costs,
    $4.3 million related to facility

    companies at amounts that are below the Company’s carrying
    value. Accordingly, the Company recorded an other than temporary
    decline in value of $2.3 million related to these
    investments.

•

The Company signed a letter of intent to sell its ownership
    interest in one of its variable interest entities at a selling
    price that is below the Company’s carrying value.
    Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of
    $3.8 million, of which $2.5 million related to the
    impairment of goodwill.

•

The Company terminated certain contractual relationships in the
    Commercial Segment. As a result, intangible assets, were
    determined to be impaired, resulting in a $2.5 million
    impairment charge.

•

An asset reclassified to held for sale was determined to be
    impaired and a $0.3 million impairment charge was
    recognized.

During 2006, the Company determined there was an other than
    temporary decline in value in three minority held investments
    and certain fixed assets were impaired. Accordingly, the Company
    recorded an aggregate charge of $7.4 million, which is
    included in restructuring and other impairment charges.

On October 1, 2007, the Company acquired all of the
    outstanding capital stock of Arrow for approximately
    $2.1 billion. The transaction was financed with cash,
    borrowings under a new senior secured syndicated bank loan and
    proceeds received through the issuance of privately placed notes.

In connection with the acquisition, the Company entered into a
    credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
    administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication
    agent, the guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto
    and each other party thereto, (the “Senior Credit
    Facility”). The Senior Credit Facility provides for a
    five-year term loan facility of $1.4 billion and a
    five-year revolving line of credit facility of

$400 million, both of which carried initial interest rates
    of LIBOR plus a spread of 150 basis points. The spread is
    subject to adjustment based upon the Company’s leverage
    ratio. At December 31, 2008, the spread over LIBOR was
    125 basis points. The Company also executed an interest
    rate swap for $600 million of the term loan from a floating
    3 month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate to a fixed rate of
    4.75%. The swap amortizes down to a notional value of
    $350 million at maturity in 2012. The obligations under the
    Senior Credit Facility are obligations of the Company and
    substantially all of its material wholly-owned domestic
    subsidiaries of the Company and are secured by a pledge of
    shares of certain of the Company’s domestic and foreign
    subsidiaries.

In addition, the Company (i) entered into a Note Purchase
    Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2007, among Teleflex
    Incorporated and the several purchasers party thereto (the
    “Note Purchase Agreement”) and issued
    $200 million in new senior secured notes pursuant thereto
    (the “2007 notes”), (ii) amended the terms of the
    note purchase agreement dated July 8, 2004 and the notes
    issued pursuant thereto (the “2004 Notes”) and the
    note purchase agreement dated October 25, 2002 and the
    notes issued pursuant thereto (the “2002 Notes” and,
    together with the 2004 Notes, the “amended notes”) and
    (iii) repaid $10.5 million of notes issued pursuant to
    the note agreements dated November 1, 1992 and
    December 15, 1993 (the “retired notes”).

The 2007 notes and the amended notes, referred to collectively
    as the “senior notes”, rank pari passu in right of
    repayment with the Company’s obligations under the Senior
    Credit Facility (the “primary bank obligations”) and
    are secured and guaranteed in the same manner as the primary
    bank obligations. In connection with the foregoing, the holders
    of the senior notes have entered into a Collateral Agency and
    Intercreditor Agreement with the Company, pursuant to which
    JPMorgan Chase has been appointed as collateral agent with
    respect to the collateral pledged by the Company under the
    Senior Credit Facility and the senior note agreements. The
    senior notes have mandatory prepayment requirements upon the
    sale of certain assets and may be accelerated upon certain
    events of default, in each case, on the same basis as the
    primary bank obligations.

The interest rates payable on the amended notes were also
    modified in connection with the foregoing transactions.
    Effective October 1, 2007, (a) the 2004 Notes will
    bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at the
    following rates: (i) 7.66% in respect of the

Series 2004-1

Tranche A Senior Notes due 2011; (ii) 8.14% in respect
    of the

Series 2004-1

Tranche B Senior Notes due 2014; and (iii) 8.46% in
    respect of the

Series 2004-1

Tranche C Senior Notes due 2016; and (b) the 2002
    Notes will bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at
    the rate of 7.82% per annum. Interest rates on the amended notes
    are subject to reduction based on positive performance by the
    Company relative to certain financial ratios.

The Senior Credit Facility and the agreements with the holders
    of the senior notes contain covenants that, among other things,
    limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its
    subsidiaries to incur debt, create liens, consolidate, merge or
    dispose of certain assets, make certain investments, engage in
    acquisitions, pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions
    in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements.
    Under the most restrictive of these provisions, on an annual
    basis $99 million of retained earnings was available for
    cash dividends and stock repurchases The Senior Credit Facility
    and the senior note agreements also require the Company to
    maintain certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage
    ratios. Currently, the Company is required to maintain a
    consolidated leverage ratio (defined in the Senior Credit
    Facility as “Consolidated Leverage Ratio”) of not more
    than 4.0 to 1 and an interest coverage ratio (defined in the
    Senior Credit Facility as “Consolidated Interest Coverage
    Ratio”) of not less than 3.5 to 1. As of December 31,
    2008, the Company was in compliance with the terms of the Senior
    Credit Facility and the senior notes.

At December 31, 2008, the Company borrowed
    $36.8 million under its revolving line of credit. The
    Company has approximately $356 million available in
    committed financing through the Senior Credit Facility.

The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet
    as of December 31, 2008 for long-term debt is
    $1,541.2 million. Using a discounted cash flow technique
    that incorporates a market interest yield curve with adjustments
    for duration, optionality, and risk profile, the Company has
    determined the fair value of its debt to be
    $1,442.4 million at December 31, 2008. The
    Company’s implied credit rating is a factor in determining
    the market interest yield curve.

Notes payable at December 31, 2008 consists of demand loans
    due to banks of $5.2 million borrowed at an average
    interest rate of 7.21%.

Note 9 — Financial
    instruments

The Company uses forward rate contracts to manage currency
    transaction exposure and interest rate swaps for exposure to
    interest rate changes. These cash flow hedges are recorded on
    the balance sheet at fair market value and subsequent changes in
    value are recognized in the statement of income or as part of
    comprehensive income net of tax. The fair value of the interest
    rate swap contract is developed from market-based inputs under
    the income approach using cash flows discounted at relevant
    market interest rates. The fair value of the foreign currency
    forward exchange contracts represents the amount required to
    enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining
    maturities based on quoted market prices. Approximately
    $16.0 million of the amount in accumulated other
    comprehensive income at December 31, 2008 would be
    reclassified as expense to the statement of income during 2009
    should foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates remain
    at December 31, 2008 levels.

During 2008, revaluations of our interest rate swap resulted in
    a $23.4 million decrease to other comprehensive income. The
    decrease is due to a reduction in the benchmark interest
    rate — 3 month USD Libor. Additions and
    revaluations of our forward rate contracts contributed
    approximately $6.5 million to the decrease in other
    comprehensive income.

On July 25, 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $140 million of
    outstanding Company common stock over twelve months ended July
    2006. In June 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors
    extended for an additional six months, until January 2007, its
    authorization for the repurchase of shares. Under the approved
    plan, the Company repurchased a total of 2,317 thousand shares
    on the open market during 2005 and 2006 for an aggregate
    purchase price of $140.0 million, and aggregate fees and
    commissions of $0.1 million.

On June 14, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of
    outstanding Company common stock. Repurchases of Company stock
    under the Board authorization may be made from time to time in
    the open market and may include privately-negotiated
    transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to
    regulatory considerations. The stock repurchase program has no
    expiration date and the Company’s ability to execute on the
    program will depend on, among other factors, cash requirements
    for acquisitions, cash generation from operations, debt
    repayment obligations, market conditions and regulatory
    requirements. In addition, under the senior loan agreements
    entered into October 1, 2007, the Company is subject to
    certain restrictions relating to its ability to repurchase
    shares in the event the Company’s consolidated leverage
    ratio exceeds certain levels, which may further limit the
    Company’s ability to repurchase shares under this Board
    authorization. Through December 31, 2008, no shares have
    been purchased under this Board authorization.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
    the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed in the same
    manner except that the weighted average number of shares is
    increased for dilutive securities. The difference between basic
    and diluted weighted average common shares results from the
    assumption that dilutive stock options were exercised. A
    reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares
    outstanding is as follows:

    compensation plans

The Company has two stock-based compensation plans under which
    equity-based awards may be made. The Company’s 2000 Stock
    Compensation Plan (the “2000 plan”) provides for the
    granting of incentive and non-qualified stock options and
    restricted stock units to directors, officers and key employees.
    Under the 2000 plan, the Company is authorized to issue up to
    4 million shares of common stock, but no more than 800,000
    of those shares may be issued as restricted stock. Options
    granted under the 2000 plan have an exercise price

equal to the average of the high and low sales prices of the
    Company’s common stock on the date of the grant, rounded to
    the nearest $0.25. Generally, options granted under the 2000
    plan are exercisable three to five years after the date of the
    grant and expire no more than ten years after the grant.
    Outstanding restricted stock units generally vest in one to
    three years. In 2008, the Company granted incentive and
    non-qualified options to purchase 394,381 shares of common
    stock and granted restricted stock units representing
    164,818 shares of common stock under the 2000 plan. As of
    December 31, 2008, 363,998 shares were available for
    future grant under the 2000 plan.

The Company’s 2008 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2008
    plan”) provides for the granting of various types of
    equity-based awards to directors, officers and key employees.
    These awards include incentive and non-qualified stock options,
    stock appreciation rights, stock awards and other stock-based
    awards. Under the 2008 plan, the Company is authorized to issue
    up to 2.5 million shares of common stock, but grants of
    awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights
    may not exceed 875,000 shares. Options granted under the
    2008 plan will have an exercise price equal to the closing price
    of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The
    2008 plan was approved by the Company’s stockholders on
    May 1, 2008 at the Company’s annual meeting of
    stockholders. In 2008, no awards were granted under the 2008
    plan.

The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based awards on
    the date of grant using an option pricing model. Stock-based
    compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the
    value of the portion of stock-based awards that is ultimately
    expected to vest during the period. Stock-based compensation
    expense recognized in 2006, 2007 and 2008 included compensation
    expense for (1) stock-based awards granted prior to, but
    not yet vested as of December 25, 2005, based on the fair
    value on the grant date estimated in accordance with the pro
    forma provisions of SFAS No. 123 and
    (2) compensation expense for the stock-based awards granted
    subsequent to December 25, 2005, based on the fair value on
    the grant date estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R). As stock-based compensation expense
    recognized for fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008 is based on awards
    ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated
    forfeitures. SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to
    be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in
    subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
    estimates. Management reviews and revises the estimate of
    forfeitures for all graded (annual vesting tranches) share-based
    awards on a quarterly basis based on management’s
    expectation of the awards that will ultimately vest to minimize
    fluctuations in share-based compensation expense. In 2008, the
    Company issued 164,818 non-vested shares (restricted stock) the
    majority of which vest in three years (cliff vesting).

Stock-based compensation expense is measured using a multiple
    point Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account
    highly subjective and complex assumptions. The expected life of
    options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award,
    as well as historical exercise behavior, and represents the
    period of time that options granted are expected to be
    outstanding. Expected volatilities are based on a blend of
    historical volatility and implied volatility derived from
    publicly traded options to purchase the Company’s common
    stock, which the Company believes is more reflective of the
    market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility
    than solely using historical volatility. The risk-free interest
    rate is the implied yield currently available on
    U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term
    equal to the expected life of the option.

Taxes on income from continuing operations in 2008 were
    $52.2 million. In 2008, the Company repatriated foreign
    earnings upon which income taxes had been provided under
    APB 23 in 2007. The taxes were provided as a deferred tax
    liability in 2007 and became current in 2008 when the earnings
    were repatriated.

In 2007, the Company repatriated approximately $197 million
    of cash from foreign subsidiaries which had previously been
    deemed to be permanently reinvested in the respective foreign
    jurisdictions and changed its position with respect to certain
    previously untaxed foreign earnings to treat these earnings as
    no longer permanently reinvested. The change in the permanently
    reinvested treatment of the previously untaxed foreign earnings
    allows for future cash repatriations to be used to service debt.
    As a result of the change in its permanently reinvested
    position, the Company recorded a tax charge of approximately
    $91.8 million.

In 2007, the Company also completed the sale of two significant
    business units: 1) the precision-machined components
    business in the Aerospace segment, and 2) the automotive
    and industrial driver controls, motion systems and fluid
    handling systems business in the Commercial segment. These
    business units had income

before taxes for 2007 of $50.5 million, which has been
    reported as part of discontinued operations, along with the
    related taxes on income of $15.5 million. The Company
    recorded gains on the sale of these business units of
    $299.5 million, along with the related taxes on the gain of
    $145.6 million. The gain and related taxes have also been
    reported as part of discontinued operations.

At December 31, 2008, the cumulative unremitted earnings of
    other subsidiaries outside the United States, considered
    permanently reinvested, for which no income or withholding taxes
    have been provided, approximated $587.5 million. Such
    earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely and, as a
    result, no deferred tax liability has been recognized with
    regard to the remittance of such earnings. It is not practicable
    to estimate the income tax liability that might be incurred if
    such earnings were remitted to the United States.

Under the tax laws of various jurisdictions in which the Company
    operates, deductions or credits that cannot be fully utilized
    for tax purposes during the current year may be carried forward,
    subject to statutory limitations, to reduce taxable income or
    taxes payable in a future tax year. At December 31, 2008,
    the tax effect of such carry forwards approximated
    $80.2 million. Of this amount, $21.1 million has no
    expiration date, $3.7 million expires after 2008 but before
    the end of 2013 and $55.4 million expires after 2013. A
    substantial amount of these carryforwards consist of tax losses
    which were acquired in an acquisition by the Company in 2004.
    Therefore, the utilization of these tax attributes is subject to
    an annual limitation imposed by Section 382 of the Internal
    Revenue Code. It is not expected that this annual limitation
    will prevent the Company from utilizing its carryforwards. The
    determination of state net operating loss carryforwards are
    dependent upon the U.S. subsidiaries’ taxable income
    or loss, apportionment percentages and other respective state
    laws, which can change year to year and impact the amount of
    such carryforward.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of
    $57.9 million and $68.5 million at December 31,
    2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, relates
    principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain
    deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards
    in various jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was calculated
    in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109,
    which requires that a valuation allowance be established and
    maintained when it is “more likely than not” that all
    or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
    valuation allowance decrease in 2008 was primarily attributable
    to the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity, the
    ability to utilize state net operating losses after the merger
    of several medical subsidiaries, and the utilization of state
    net operating losses as a result of a one time shift in state
    apportionment factors following the GMS transaction in 2007.

Several foreign subsidiaries continue to operate under separate
    “tax holiday” arrangements as granted by certain
    foreign jurisdictions. The nature and extent of such
    arrangements vary and the benefits of such arrangements phase
    out in future years according to the specific terms and
    schedules as set forth by the particular taxing authorities
    having jurisdiction over the arrangements. The most significant
    arrangement expires in March 2015.

Uncertain Tax Positions:

On January 1,
    2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48, and as
    a result of that adoption, the Company recognized a charge of
    $14.2 million to retained earnings. A reconciliation of the

The total liabilities associated with the unrecognized tax
    benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax
    rate were $55.6 million and $36.2 million at
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 respectively.
    With the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R), effective for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, certain
    unrecognized tax benefits that would not have an impact on the
    Company’s effective tax rate if realized (or re-measured)
    prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will now have
    an impact on the Company’s effective tax rate if realized
    (or re-measured) after the adoption of
    SFAS No. 141(R). Subsequent to the adoption of
    FAS 141(R) (effective for the Company with its year
    beginning January 1, 2009) any expense or benefit
    associated with realizing (or re-measuring) the unrecognized tax
    benefit will be recorded as part of income tax expense.

The Company accrues interest and penalties associated with
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the
    consolidated statements of operations, and the corresponding
    liability is included within the FIN 48 liability in the
    consolidated balance sheets. The expense for interest (net of
    related tax benefits where applicable) and penalties reflected
    in income from continuing operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 was $3.0 million and
    $1.1 million respectively ($3.8 million and
    $1.4 million respectively for the year ended
    December 31, 2007). The corresponding liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets for interest and penalties were
    $14.4 million and $6.2 million respectively at
    December 31, 2008 ($11.3 million and $4.9 million
    at December 31, 2007).

The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to income
    tax examinations by various taxing authorities. As a result of
    the outcome of ongoing or future examinations, or due to the
    expiration of statutes of limitation for certain jurisdictions,
    it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax
    benefits for tax positions taken could materially change from
    those recorded as liabilities at December 31, 2008. Based
    on the status of various examinations by the relevant federal,
    state, and foreign tax authorities, the Company anticipates that
    certain examinations may be concluded within the next twelve
    months of the reporting date of the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements, the most significant of which are in
    Germany, France, and the United States. Due to the potential for
    resolution of foreign and US examinations, and the expiration of
    various statutes of limitation, it is reasonably possible that
    the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits may change within
    the next twelve months by a range of zero to $28 million.

Note 13 — Pension
    and other postretirement benefits

The Company has a number of defined benefit pension and
    postretirement plans covering eligible U.S. and

non-U.S. employees.

The defined benefit pension plans are noncontributory. The
    benefits under these plans are based primarily on years of
    service and employees’ pay near retirement. The
    Company’s funding policy for U.S. plans is to
    contribute annually, at a minimum, amounts required by
    applicable laws and regulations. Obligations under

non-U.S. plans

are systematically provided for by depositing funds with
    trustees or by book reserves.

The parent Company and certain subsidiaries provide medical,
    dental and life insurance benefits to pensioners and survivors.
    The associated plans are unfunded and approved claims are paid
    from Company funds.

The Company initiated the following steps in connection with its
    pension benefits:

•

Effective August 31, 2008, the Arrow Salaried plan, the
    Arrow Hourly plan and the Berks plan were merged into the
    Teleflex Retirement Income Plan (“TRIP”).

•

On October 31, 2008, the TRIP was amended to cease future
    benefit accruals for all non-bargained employees as of
    December 31, 2008. This resulted in a curtailment gain at
    the date of amendment of $1.2 million.

•

On December 15, 2008, the Company amended its Supplemental
    Executive Retirement Plans (“SERP”) for all executives
    to cease future benefit accruals as of December 31, 2008.
    This resulted in a curtailment gain of $0.4 million. In
    addition, the Company approved a plan to replace the
    non-qualified defined benefits provided under the SERP with a
    non-qualified defined contribution arrangement under the

Company’s Deferred Compensation Plan, effective
    January 1, 2009. This resulted in a transfer of a portion
    of the liability of $0.4 million to the Deferred
    Compensation Plan.

The Company initiated the following steps in connection with its
    postretirement benefits:

•

On October 31, 2008, the Company’s postretirement
    benefit plans were amended to eliminate future benefits for
    non-bargained employees who had not attained age 50 or
    whose age plus service was less than 65. This resulted in a
    reduction of the expected future working life of the plan
    participants and resulted in a nominal curtailment gain.

The discount rate for U.S. plans of 6.05% was established
    by comparing the projection of expected benefit payments to the
    Citigroup Pension Discount Curve (published monthly) as of
    December 31, 2008. The expected benefit payments are
    discounted by each corresponding discount rate on the yield
    curve. Once the present value of the string of benefit payments
    is established, the Company solves for the single spot rate to
    apply to all obligations of the plan that will exactly match the
    previously determined present value.

The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve is constructed beginning
    with a U.S. Treasury par curve that reflects the entire
    Treasury and Separate Trading of Registered Interest and
    Principal Securities (“STRIPS”) market. From the
    Treasury curve, Citibank produces a AA corporate par curve by
    adding option-adjusted spreads that are

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

drawn from the AA corporate sector of the Citigroup Broad
    Investment — Grade Bond Index. Finally, from the AA
    corporate par curve, Citigroup derives the spot rates that
    constitute the Pension Discount Curve. For payments beyond
    30 years, the Company extends the curve assuming that the
    discount rate derived in year 30 is extended to the end of the
    plan’s payment expectations.

Increasing the assumed healthcare trend rate by 1% would
    increase the benefit obligation by $4.8 million and would
    increase the 2008 benefit expense by $0.4 million.
    Decreasing the trend rate by 1% would decrease the benefit
    obligation by $4.3 million and would decrease the 2008
    benefit expense by $0.4 million.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. and foreign
    defined benefit pension plans was $303.4 million and
    $283.1 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit
    obligation, and fair value of plan assets for U.S. and
    foreign plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of
    plan assets were $290.7 million, $290.1 million and
    $172.9 million, respectively for 2008 and
    $209.4 million, $204.0 million and
    $171.0 million, respectively for 2007.

Plan assets are allocated among various categories of equities,
    fixed income, cash and cash equivalents with professional
    investment managers whose performance is actively monitored. The
    target allocation among plan assets allows for variances based
    on economic and market trends. The primary investment objective
    is long-term growth of assets in order to meet present and
    future benefit obligations. The Company periodically conducts an
    asset/liability modeling study to ensure the investment strategy
    is aligned with the profile of benefit obligations.

During 2008, pension plan assets decreased approximately
    $78.7 million primarily due to the downturn in the economy.
    The decrease is the primary factor for the increase in pension
    and postretirement benefit liabilities in the consolidated
    balance sheet and a significant portion of the change in
    accumulated other comprehensive income.

The plan asset allocations for U.S. and foreign plans are
    as follows:

    postretirement healthcare plans during 2009 are expected to be

Fair Value
    Measurement

The Company adopted SFAS 157 for financial assets and
    financial liabilities as of January 1, 2008, in accordance
    with the provisions of SFAS 157 and the related guidance of

FSP 157-1,

FSP 157-2

and

FSP 157-3.

The adoption did not have an impact on the Company’s
    financial position and results of operations. The Company
    endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring
    fair value. The Company has determined the fair value of its
    financial assets based on Level 1 and Level 2 inputs
    and the fair value of its financial liabilities based on
    Level 2 inputs in accordance with the fair value hierarchy
    described as follows:

Valuation
    Hierarchy

SFAS 157 establishes a valuation hierarchy of the inputs
    used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the
    inputs into three broad levels as follows:

Level 1 inputs — quoted prices (unadjusted) in
    active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the
    Company has ability to access at the measurement date.

Level 2 inputs — inputs other than quoted prices
    included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset
    or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or
    liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2
    input must be observable for substantially the full term of the
    asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include:

1. Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in
    active markets.

2. Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
    liabilities in markets that are not active or there are few
    transactions.

3. Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for
    the asset or liability.

4. Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated
    by observable market data by correlation or other means.

Level 3 inputs — unobservable inputs for the
    asset or liability. Unobservable inputs may be used to measure
    fair value only when observable inputs are not available.
    Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s assumptions about
    the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the
    asset or liability in achieving the fair value measurement
    objective of an exit price perspective.

Valuation
    Techniques

The Company’s financial assets valued based upon
    Level 1 inputs are comprised of investments in marketable
    securities held in Rabbi Trusts which are used to pay benefits
    under certain deferred compensation plan benefits. Under these
    deferred compensation plans, participants designate investment
    options to serve as the basis for measurement of the notional
    value of their accounts. The investment assets of the rabbi
    trust are valued using quoted market prices multiplied by the
    number of shares held in the trust.

The Company’s financial assets valued based upon
    Level 2 inputs are comprised of foreign currency forward
    contracts. The Company’s financial liabilities valued based
    upon Level 2 inputs are comprised of an interest rate swap
    contract and foreign currency forward contracts. The Company has
    taken into account the creditworthiness of the counterparties in
    measuring fair value. The Company uses forward rate contracts to
    manage currency transaction exposure and interest rate swaps to
    manage exposure to interest rate changes. The fair value of the
    interest rate swap contract is developed from market-based
    inputs under the income approach using cash flows discounted at
    relevant market interest rates. The fair value of the foreign
    currency forward exchange contracts represents the amount
    required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar
    remaining maturities based on quoted market prices.

Commitments and
    contingent liabilities

Product warranty liability:

The Company
    warrants to the original purchaser of certain of its products
    that it will, at its option, repair or replace, without charge,
    such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect.
    Warranty periods vary by product. The Company has recourse
    provisions for certain products that would enable recovery from
    third parties for amounts paid under the warranty. The Company
    accrues for product warranties when, based on available
    information, it is probable that customers will make claims
    under warranties relating to products that have been sold, and a

Operating leases:

The Company uses various
    leased facilities and equipment in its operations. The terms for
    these leased assets vary depending on the lease agreement. The
    Company’s future payments cannot exceed the minimum rent
    obligation plus the residual value guarantee amount. The
    guarantee amounts are tied to the unamortized lease values of
    the assets under lease, and are due should the Company decide
    neither to renew these leases, nor to exercise its purchase
    option. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no
    liabilities recorded for these obligations. Any residual value
    guarantee amounts paid to the lessor may be recovered by the
    Company from the sale of the assets to a third party.

Future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2008
    (including residual value guarantee amounts) under noncancelable
    operating leases are as follows:

Rental expense under operating leases was $36.4 million,

We have residual value guarantees under operating leases for
    certain equipment. The maximum potential amount of future
    payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is
    approximately $1.9 million at December 31, 2008.

Accounts receivable securitization program:

We
    use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain access
    to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs. As
    currently structured, accounts receivable of certain domestic
    subsidiaries are sold on a non-recourse basis to a special
    purpose entity (“SPE”), which is a bankruptcy-remote
    subsidiary of Teleflex Incorporated that is consolidated in our
    financial statements. This SPE then sells undivided interests in
    those receivables to an asset backed commercial paper conduit.
    The conduit issues notes secured by those interests and other
    assets to third party investors.

To the extent that cash consideration is received for the sale
    of undivided interests in the receivables by the SPE to the
    conduit, it is accounted for as a sale in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140,
    “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities”, as we have
    relinquished control of the receivables. Accordingly, undivided
    interests in accounts receivable sold to the commercial paper
    conduit under these transactions are excluded from accounts
    receivables, net in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets. The interests not represented by cash consideration from
    the

F-43


TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

conduit are retained by the SPE and remain in accounts
    receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The interests in receivables sold and the interest in
    receivables retained by the SPE are carried at face value, which
    is due to the short-term nature of our accounts receivable. The
    special purpose entity has received cash consideration of
    $39.7 million and $39.7 million for the interests in
    the accounts receivable it has sold to the commercial paper
    conduit at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007,
    respectively. No gain or loss is recorded upon sale as fee
    charges from the commercial paper conduit are based upon a
    floating yield rate and the period the undivided interests
    remain outstanding. Fee charges from the commercial paper
    conduit are accrued at the end of each month. Should we default
    under the accounts receivable securitization program, the
    commercial paper conduit is entitled to receive collections on
    receivables owned by the SPE in satisfaction of the amount of
    cash consideration paid to the SPE to the commercial paper
    conduit. The assets of the SPE are not available to satisfy the
    obligations of Teleflex or any of its other subsidiaries.

Information regarding the outstanding balances related to the
    SPE’s interests in accounts receivables sold or retained as
    of December 31, 2008 is as follows:

We continue servicing the receivables sold, pursuant to
    servicing agreements with the SPE. No servicing asset is
    recorded at the time of sale because we do not receive any
    servicing fees from third parties or other income related to the
    servicing of the receivables. We do not record any servicing
    liability at the time of the sale as the receivables collection
    period is relatively short and the costs of servicing the
    receivables sold over the servicing period are insignificant.
    Servicing costs are recognized as incurred over the servicing
    period.

Environmental:

The Company is subject to
    contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations
    that in the future may require the Company to take further
    action to correct the effects on the environment of prior
    disposal practices or releases of chemical or petroleum
    substances by the Company or other parties. Much of this
    liability results from the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”),
    often referred to as Superfund, the U.S. Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and similar
    state laws. These laws require the Company to undertake certain
    investigative and remedial activities at

sites where the Company conducts or once conducted operations or
    at sites where Company-generated waste was disposed.

Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost
    from site to site. These activities, and their associated costs,
    depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving
    remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and
    enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of
    potentially responsible parties. At December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007, the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet included an accrued liability of $8.9 million and
    $7.5 million, respectively, relating to these matters.
    Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs and,
    under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may
    exceed the amount accrued as of December 31, 2008. The
    time-frame over which the accrued or presently unrecognized
    amounts may be paid out, based on past history, is estimated to
    be

15-20 years.

Regulatory matters:

On October 11, 2007,
    the Company’s subsidiary, Arrow International, Inc.
    (“Arrow”), received a corporate warning letter from
    the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The letter
    cites three site-specific warning letters issued by the FDA in
    2005 and subsequent inspections performed from June 2005 to
    February 2007 at Arrow’s facilities in the United States.
    The letter expresses concerns with Arrow’s quality systems,
    including complaint handling, corrective and preventive action,
    process and design validation, inspection and training
    procedures. It also advises that Arrow’s corporate-wide
    program to evaluate, correct and prevent quality system issues
    has been deficient. Limitations on pre-market approvals and
    certificates of foreign goods had previously been imposed on
    Arrow based on prior inspections and the corporate warning
    letter does not impose additional sanctions that are expected to
    have a material financial impact on the Company.

In connection with its acquisition of Arrow, completed on
    October 1, 2007, the Company developed an integration plan
    that includes the commitment of significant resources to correct
    these previously-identified regulatory issues and further
    improve overall quality systems. Senior management officials
    from the Company have met with FDA representatives, and a
    comprehensive written corrective action plan was presented to
    FDA in late 2007. The Company has begun implementing its
    corrective action plan, which it expects to complete, for most
    facilities and procedures, by the end of March 2009.

While the Company believes it can remediate these issues, there
    can be no assurances regarding the length of time or
    expenditures required to resolve these issues to the
    satisfaction of the FDA. If the Company’s remedial actions
    are not satisfactory to the FDA, the Company may have to devote
    additional financial and human resources to its efforts, and the
    FDA may take further regulatory actions against the Company,
    including, but not limited to, seizing its product inventory,
    obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of the
    Company’s products, assessing civil monetary penalties or
    imposing a consent decree on us.

In June 2008, HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) assessed
    Airfoil Technologies International UK Limited
    (“ATI-UK”), a consolidated United Kingdom venture in
    which the Company has a 60% economic interest, approximately
    $10 million for customs duty for the period from
    July 1, 2005 through March 31, 2008. HMRC had
    previously assessed ATI-UK approximately $737,000 for customs
    duty for the first and second quarters of 2004. Additionally,
    for the above periods, ATI-UK was assessed a value added tax
    (“VAT”) of approximately $68 million, for which
    HMRC has advised ATI-UK that, to the extent it is due and
    payable, it has until March 2010 to fully recover such VAT.
    The assessments were imposed because HMRC concluded that ATI-UK
    did not provide the necessary documentation for which reliance
    on Inland Processing Relief status (duty and VAT) was claimed by
    ATI-UK.

ATI-UK has filed appeals and been granted hardship applications
    (to avoid payment of the assessment while the appeal is pending)
    regarding each of the assessments. ATI-UK provided certain
    documentation to HMRC with regard to the first quarter of 2004,
    and as a result, the HMRC reduced the assessment for customs
    duties for

F-45


TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

that quarter by 97%, from approximately $17,860 to $450, and
    reduced the assessment for VAT for that quarter by 99%, from
    approximately $117,540 to $1,650, which amounts have been paid
    and all VAT recovered.

ATI-UK

has
    provided essentially the same types of supporting documentation
    to HMRC for the remaining quarters for which it was assessed.
    Based on discussions between ATI-UK and the HMRC inspector with
    regard to the assessments for the remaining periods, ATI-UK is
    hopeful that it will obtain reductions in the assessments that
    are proportionately similar to those obtained for the first
    quarter of 2004. However, the Company cannot assure whether or
    the extent to which the HMRC will reduce its assessments for
    these periods. In the event ATI-UK is not successful in a
    favorable resolution of the remaining assessments, such outcome
    would have a material adverse effect on the business of ATI-UK.
    The Company has a net investment in ATI-UK of approximately
    $11 million.

Litigation:

The Company is a party to various
    lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business.
    These lawsuits and claims include actions involving product
    liability, intellectual property, import and export regulations,
    employment and environmental matters. Based on information
    currently available, advice of counsel, established reserves and
    other resources, the Company does not believe that any such
    actions are likely to be, individually or in the aggregate,
    material to its business, financial condition, and results of
    operations or liquidity. However, in the event of unexpected
    further developments, it is possible that the ultimate
    resolution of these matters, or other similar matters, if
    unfavorable, may be materially adverse to the Company’s
    business, financial condition, results of operations or
    liquidity. Legal costs such as outside counsel fees and expenses
    are charged to expense in the period incurred.

Other:

The Company has various purchase
    commitments for materials, supplies and items of permanent
    investment incident to the ordinary conduct of business. In the
    aggregate, such commitments are not at prices in excess of
    current market.

Business segments
    and other information

SFAS No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information,

defines an operating
    segment as a component of an enterprise (a) that engages in
    business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur
    expenses, (b) whose operating results are regularly
    reviewed by the enterprise’s chief operating decision maker
    to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment
    and to assess its performance, and (c) for which discrete
    financial information is available. Based on these criteria, the
    Company has determined that it has three reportable segments:
    Medical, Aerospace and Commercial

The Medical Segment businesses develop, manufacture and
    distribute medical devices primarily used in critical care,
    surgical applications and cardiac care. Additionally, the
    company designs, manufactures and supplies devices and
    instruments for medical device manufacturers. Over
    80 percent of Medical Segment net revenues are derived from
    devices that are considered disposable or single use. The
    Medical Segment’s products are largely sold and distributed
    to hospitals and healthcare providers and are most widely used
    in the acute care setting for a range of diagnostic and
    therapeutic procedures and in general and specialty surgical
    applications.

Our Aerospace Segment businesses provide repair products and
    services for flight and ground-based turbine engines and cargo
    handling systems for wide body and narrow body aircraft.
    Commercial aviation markets represent 99% of revenues in this
    segment. Markets for these products are generally influenced by
    spending patterns in the commercial aviation markets, cargo
    market trends, flights hours, and age and type of engines in use.

The Commercial Segment businesses principally design,
    manufacture and distribute driver controls and engine and drive
    parts for the marine market, power and fuel systems for truck,
    rail, automotive and industrial vehicles and rigging products
    and services. Commercial Segment products are used in a range of
    markets

On December 27, 2007 the Company completed the sale of its
    business units that design and manufacture automotive and
    industrial driver controls, motion systems and fluid handling
    systems (the “GMS” businesses) to Kongsberg Automotive
    Holding for $560 million in cash and realized a pre-tax
    gain of $224.2 million. The business units divested,
    Teleflex Automotive, Teleflex Industrial and Teleflex Fluid
    Systems were all part of the Company’s Commercial Segment.

In 2008, the Company refined its estimates for the post-closing
    adjustments related to the sale of the GMS businesses based on
    the provisions of the Purchase Agreement. Also during 2008, the
    Company recorded a charge for the settlement of a contingency
    related to the GMS businesses. These charges are reported as a
    loss from discontinued operations of $14.2 million, net of
    taxes of $6.0 million for the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2008. The Company is continuing to discuss
    certain aspects of the post closing adjustments with Kongsberg
    Automotive Holding. The Company has recorded its best estimate
    for these matters.

On June 29, 2007 the Company completed the sale of Teleflex
    Aerospace Manufacturing Group (“TAMG”), a
    precision-machined components business in the Aerospace Segment
    for $133.9 million in cash and realized a pre-tax gain of
    $75.2 million.

During 2006 the company sold a small medical business and
    incurred a pre-tax loss of $0.5 million. Also during 2006,
    the Company finalized the post closing adjustments related to
    the three 2005 divestitures and realized a net pre-tax gain of
    $0.7 million.
