PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Teleflex Incorporated is referred to herein as “we,”
    “us,” “our,” “Teleflex” and the
    “Company.”

THE
    COMPANY

Teleflex is principally a global provider of medical technology
    products that enable healthcare providers to improve patient
    outcomes, reduce infections and enhance patient and provider
    safety. We primarily develop, manufacture and supply single-use

    and surgical applications. We serve hospitals and healthcare
    providers in more than 140 countries.

We provide a broad-based platform of medical products, which we
    categorize into four groups: Critical Care, Surgical Care,
    Cardiac Care and OEM and Development Services. Critical care,
    representing our largest product group, includes medical devices
    used in vascular access, anesthesia, urology and respiratory
    care applications; surgical care includes surgical instruments
    and devices; and cardiac care includes cardiac assist devices
    and equipment. We also design and manufacture instruments and
    devices for other medical device manufacturers. Our primary
    products and product brands include the following:

•

Arrow vascular access products, including, central venous access
    catheters, or CVCs, featuring the ARROWg+ard, or ARROWg+ard Blue
    Plus, antiseptic surface treatments to reduce the risk of
    catheter related infection, peripherally inserted central
    catheters, or PICCs, catheters for use in treatment of chronic
    hemodialysis and catheters and accessories used in critical care
    monitoring and treatment;

•

Sheridan and Rüsch endotracheal tubes, laryngeal masks,
    airways and face masks to deliver anesthetic agents and oxygen,
    and Arrow regional anesthesia products that include catheters
    used in epidural, spinal and peripheral nerve block procedures;

•

Hudson RCI and Gibeck brand humidifiers, circuits, nebulizers,
    filters, masks, tubing and cannulas used in aerosol and
    medication delivery, oxygen therapy and ventilation management;

    TFXOEM customized medical instruments, implants and components.

Teleflex is focused on achieving consistent, sustainable and
    profitable growth through development of new products, expansion
    of market share, introduction of existing products into new
    geographies and through selected acquisitions which enhance or
    expedite our development initiatives and our ability to grow
    market share. Furthermore, we believe our research and
    development capabilities and our commitment to engineering
    excellence and lean, low-cost manufacturing allow us to
    consistently bring cost effective, innovative products to market
    that improve the safety, efficacy, and quality of healthcare.

In addition to our medical business, we also have businesses
    that serve niche segments of the aerospace and commercial
    markets with specialty engineered products. Our aerospace
    products include cargo-handling systems, containers, and pallets
    for commercial air cargo, and military aircraft actuators. Our
    commercial


products include driver controls, engine assemblies and drive
    parts for the marine industry and rigging products and services
    for commercial industries.

HISTORY AND
    RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Teleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision
    mechanical push/pull controls for military aircraft. From this
    original single market, single product orientation, we have
    grown through an active program of development of new products,
    introduction of products into new geographic or end-markets and
    through acquisitions of companies with related market,
    technology or industry expertise. Throughout our history, we
    have continually focused on providing innovative
    technology-driven, specialty-engineered products that help our
    customers meet their business requirements.

Over the past several years, we have engaged in an extensive
    acquisition and divestiture program to improve margins, reduce
    cyclicality and focus our resources on the development of our
    healthcare business. We have significantly changed the
    composition of our portfolio of businesses, expanding our
    presence in the medical device industry, while divesting many of
    our businesses serving the aerospace and industrial markets. The
    most significant of these transactions occurred in 2007 with our
    acquisition of Arrow International, a leading global supplier of
    catheter-based medical technology products used for vascular
    access and cardiac care, and the divestiture of our automotive
    and industrial businesses. Our acquisition of Arrow
    significantly expanded our disposable medical product offerings
    for critical care, enhanced our global footprint and added to
    our research and development capabilities.

We continually evaluate the composition of the portfolio of our
    products and businesses to ensure alignment with our overall
    objectives. We strive to maintain a portfolio of products and
    businesses that provide consistency of performance, improved
    profitability and sustainable growth.

OUR BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS

We operate our businesses through three segments, the largest of
    which is our Medical Segment, which represented 77 percent
    of our consolidated revenues and 91 percent of our segment
    operating profit in 2009. In 2009, our Aerospace and Commercial
    segments represented 10 percent and 13 percent of
    consolidated revenues, respectively, and 5 percent and
    4 percent of segment operating profit, respectively.

Further detail and additional information regarding our segments
    and geographic areas is presented in Note 17 to our
    consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Medical

Our Medical Segment designs, develops, manufactures and supplies
    medical devices for critical care and surgical applications. We
    categorize our medical products into four product groups:
    Critical Care, Surgical, Cardiac Care, and OEM and Development
    Services.

Approximately 49 percent of our segment revenues are
    derived from customers outside the United States. Our Medical
    Segment operates 30 manufacturing sites, with major
    manufacturing operations located in Czech Republic, Germany,
    Malaysia, Mexico and the United States.

The following is an overview of the key product lines within our
    Medical Segment.

Critical
    Care

Critical care, which is predominantly comprised of single use
    products, constitutes the largest product category within our
    Medical Segment, representing 65 percent of segment
    revenues in 2009. Our medical products are used in a wide range
    of critical care procedures for vascular access, respiratory
    care, anesthesia and airway management, treatment of urologic
    conditions and other specialty procedures.


We are a leading provider of specialty products for critical
    care. Our products are generally marketed under the brand names
    of Arrow, Rüsch, HudsonRCI, Gibeck and Sheridan. The large
    majority of sales for disposable medical products are made to
    the hospital/healthcare provider market, with a smaller
    percentage sold to alternate sites.

Vascular Access
    Products

Our vascular access products are generally catheter-based
    products used in a variety of clinical procedures to facilitate
    multiple critical care therapies including the administration of
    intravenous medications, other therapies, and the measurement of
    blood pressure and taking of blood samples through a single
    puncture site.

Our vascular access catheters and related devices consist
    principally of central venous access catheters such as the
    following: the Arrow-Howe’s Multi-Lumen Catheter, a
    catheter equipped with three or four channels, or lumens;
    double-and single-lumen catheters, which are designed for use in
    a variety of clinical procedures; the Arrow Pressure Injectable
    CVC, which gives clinicians who perform contrast-enhanced CT
    scans the option of using an indwelling pressure injectable
    Arrow CVC without having to insert another catheter for their
    scan; and percutaneous sheath introducers, which are used as a
    means for inserting cardiovascular and other catheterization
    devices into the vascular system during critical care procedures.

We also provide a range of peripherally inserted central
    catheters, which are soft, flexible catheters inserted in the
    upper arm and advanced into the superior vena cava and are
    accessed for various types of intravenous medications and
    therapies, and radial artery catheters, which are used for
    measuring arterial blood pressure and taking blood samples. Our
    offerings include a pressure injectable peripherally inserted
    catheter which addresses the therapeutic need for a catheter
    that can withstand the higher pressures required by the
    injection of contrast media for CT scans.

Our vascular access products also include specialty catheters
    and related products used in a range of other procedures and
    include percutaneous thrombolytic devices, which are designed
    for clearance of thrombosed hemodialysis grafts in chronic
    hemodialysis patients; and hemodialysis access catheters,
    including the
    Cannon

®

Catheter, which is used to facilitate dialysis treatment.

Many of our vascular access catheters are treated with the
    ARROWg+ard, or ARROWg+ard Blue Plus, antiseptic surface
    treatments to reduce the risk of catheter related infection.
    ARROWg+ard Blue Plus is a newer, longer lasting formulation of
    ARROWg+ard and provides antimicrobial treatment of the interior
    lumens and hubs of each catheter.

As part of our ongoing efforts to meet physicians’ needs
    for safety and management of risk of infection in the hospital
    setting, we sell a Maximal Barrier Precautions central venous
    access kit, which includes a full body drape, a catheter treated
    with the ARROWg+ard antimicrobial technology and other
    accessories. The features of this kit were created to assist
    healthcare providers in complying with guidelines for reducing
    catheter-related bloodstream infections that have been
    established by a variety of health regulatory agencies, such as
    the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Joint
    Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.

Related products include custom tubing sets used to connect
    central venous catheters to blood pressure monitoring devices
    and drug infusion systems.

During 2009, we introduced the Arrow Pressure Injectable Triple
    Lumen PICC with a non-tapered catheter body and the Arrow
    BlueFlexTip, designed to reduce the risk of thrombosis and
    infection associated with venous access catheters. We introduced
    a new tray design and additional features for our kits
    containing our Arrow Pressure Injectable CVC, and a CVC kit
    designed specifically for the needs of the Japanese market.


Respiratory
    Care

Our respiratory care products principally consist of devices
    used in aerosol and medication delivery, oxygen therapy and
    ventilation management. We offer an extensive range of aerosol
    therapy products, including the Micromist Nebulizer, the
    Neb-U-Mask System and the Opti-Neb Pro Compressor. We are also a
    global provider of oxygen supplies, offering a broad range of
    products to deliver oxygen therapy safely and comfortably. These
    include masks, cannulas, tubing and humidifiers. These products
    are used in a variety of clinical settings including hospitals,
    long-term care facilities, rehabilitation centers and
    patients’ homes to treat respiratory ailments such as
    chronic lung disease, pneumonia, cystic fibrosis and asthma.

Our ventilation management products promote patient safety and
    maximize clinician efficiency. These products include ventilator
    circuits with an extended life to support clinical practice
    guidelines, high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters that
    provide protection against the transmission of bacteria and
    viruses, heat and moisture exchangers that reduce circuit
    manipulation and cross-contamination risk and heated humidifiers
    that promote patient compliance to non-invasive respiratory
    strategies, like Non-Invasive Ventilation and High Flow Oxygen
    Therapy.

Our ConchaTherm Neptune is a heated humidification solution. It
    is designed to enable the caregiver to customize patient
    treatment to meet specific clinical goals and to facilitate
    advanced patient outcomes without sacrificing clinician
    efficiency.

During 2009, we introduced the Gibeck HumidFlo heat and moisture
    exchanger, which allows medication to be delivered without
    breaking the breathing circuit or interrupting ventilation, and
    OSMO, a product that allows for maintenance free water removal
    from the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit during
    mechanical ventilation (breathing systems used to deliver
    medical gases from a ventilator to a patient’s lungs). In
    2009, we also signed an agreement to act as an exclusive
    distributor of the ResMed Non-Invasive Ventilation mask
    portfolio for specified acute care hospitals in the United
    States.

Anesthesia and
    Airway Management

Our anesthesia and airway management products include
    endotracheal tubes, laryngeal masks, airways and face masks to
    deliver anesthetic agents and oxygen. To assist in the placement
    of endotracheal tubes, we provide a comprehensive and unique
    line of laryngoscope blades and handles, including standard
    halogen and fiber optic light sources.

Our regional anesthesia or acute pain management products
    include epidural, spinal and peripheral nerve block catheters.
    Nerve blocks provide pain relief during and after surgical
    procedures and help clinicians better manage each patient’s
    pain. We offer the first stimulating continuous nerve block
    catheter, the Arrow StimuCath, which confirms the positive
    placement of the catheter next to the nerve. The Flex Tip Plus
    continuous epidural catheter features a soft, flexible tip that
    helps reduce the incidence of complications, such as transient
    paresthesia and inadvertent cannulation of blood vessels or the
    dura, while improving the clinician’s ability to thread the
    catheter into the epidural space. Our Arrow TheraCath epidural
    catheter, with high compression strength for direction-ability
    and enhanced radiopacity, was designed for pain management
    procedures where increased steer-ability is important.
    Additional integral components create a range of standard and
    custom procedural kits.

During 2009, we introduced a new line of laryngeal masks, added
    a line of disposable metal laryngoscope blades to our line of
    laryngoscope products and extended our endotracheal tube product
    line. We also expanded our range of products for acute pain
    management with the introduction of new spinal kits marketed
    under the Arrow SureBlock Spinal brand.


Urology

Our line of urology products provides bladder management for
    patients in the hospital and home care markets. Our product
    portfolio consists principally of catheters (including Foley,
    intermittent, external and suprapubic), urine collectors,
    catheterization accessories and products for operative
    endurology. We believe we have significant market share in Foley
    catheters in the EMEA markets (Europe, the Middle East and
    Africa).

We also design our urine collectors, catheterization accessories
    and kits with our overall infection prevention strategy in mind.
    For example, the Rüsch MMG Closed System intermittent
    catheter is used by spinal cord injury patients to help reduce
    the likelihood of urinary tract infections.

In the United States, reimbursement regulations were implemented
    in 2009 that allow many Medicare patients to shift from a
    re-useable practice, with its inherent risk of infections, to a
    single use disposable practice. Sales of our intermittent
    catheters in the U.S. have benefited from this
    reimbursement shift.

During 2009, we introduced new intermittent catheters with
    hydrophilic coatings, a new Profile urinary Foley catheter, and
    a silicone post-operative Foley catheter all marketed under the
    Rüsch brand.

Surgical
    Care

Surgical care, which is predominantly comprised of single use
    products, represented 19 percent of Medical Segment
    revenues in 2009. Our surgical products include: ligation and
    closure products, including appliers, clips, and sutures used in
    a variety of surgical procedures; access ports used in minimally
    invasive surgical procedures including robotic surgery; and
    fluid management products used for chest drainage. Our surgical
    products also include hand-held instruments for general and
    specialty surgical procedures, In addition, we provide
    instrument management services. We market surgical products
    under the Deknatel, Pleur-evac, Pilling, Taut and Weck brand
    names.

Hem-o-lok is a unique locking polymer ligation clip, and is a
    significant part of the Weck portfolio. Hem-o-lok clips have
    special applications in robotic, laparoscopic and cardiovascular
    surgery and provide surgeons with a unique level of security and
    performance.

In 2009, we introduced the Taut Universal Seal designed for use
    with the ADAPt line of bladeless laparoscopic access devices.
    The new Taut seal provides surgeons the ability to perform
    laparoscopic procedures with variable diameter instruments,
    without flimsy diaphragm seals, lubricants that can smudge
    cameras or the need for reducer caps. Also during 2009, we added
    a new rotating head stapler and a new long endoscopic clip
    applier to our extensive line of ligation products.

Cardiac
    Care

Cardiac care products accounted for approximately 5 percent
    of Medical Segment revenues in fiscal 2009. Products in this
    category include diagnostic catheters and capital equipment,
    such as thermodilution and wedge pressure catheters; specialized
    angiographic catheters, such as Berman and Reverse Berman
    catheters; therapeutic delivery catheters, such as temporary
    pacing catheters; and intra-aortic balloon, or IAB, catheters to
    capital equipment, such as intra-aortic balloon pump, or IABP,
    consoles. IABP products are used to augment oxygen delivery to
    the cardiac muscle and reduce the oxygen demand after cardiac
    surgery, serious heart attack or interventional procedures.

The IAB and IABP product lines feature the AutoCAT 2 WAVE
    console and the FiberOptix catheter, which together utilize
    fiber optic technology for arterial pressure signal acquisition
    and enable the patented WAVE timing algorithm to support the
    broadest range of patient heart rhythms, including severely
    arrhythmic patients.


OEM and
    Development Services

Customized medical instruments, implants and components sold to
    original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, represented
    10 percent of Medical Segment revenues in 2009. Under the
    Beere Medical, KMedic, Specialized Medical Devices, Deknatel and
    TFXOEM brand names, we provide specialized product development
    services, which include design engineering, prototyping and
    testing, manufacturing, assembly and packaging. Our OEM product
    development and manufacturing facilities are located globally in
    close proximity to major medical device manufacturers in
    Germany, Ireland, Mexico and the United States.

The OEM category includes custom extrusion, catheter
    fabrication, introducer systems, sheath/dilator sets, specialty
    sutures, resins and performance fibers. We also provide machined
    and forged instrumentation for general and specialty procedures,
    Ortho-Grip

®

instrument handles and fixation devices used primarily for
    orthopedic procedures.

Aerospace

Our Aerospace Segment businesses provide cargo handling systems
    and equipment for wide body and narrow body aircraft, cargo
    containment devices for air cargo and passenger baggage, and
    actuators for applications in commercial and military aircraft.
    We are a leading global provider of cargo handling systems and
    equipment and cargo containers for commercial aircraft. Our
    brand names, Telair International and Nordisk, are well known
    and respected on a global basis.


Sales to customers in commercial aviation markets represent
    95 percent of revenues in this segment in 2009. Markets for
    our commercial aviation products are influenced by the level of
    general economic activity, investment patterns in new aircraft,
    both passenger and cargo, cargo market trends and flight hours.
    Major locations for manufacturing and service are located in
    Germany, Norway, the United States, Sweden, Singapore and China.

Cargo-handling
    Systems and Equipment

Our cargo-handling systems include on-board automated
    cargo-loading systems for wide-body aircraft, baggage-handling
    systems for narrow body aircraft, aftermarket spare parts and
    repair services. Marketed under the Telair International brand
    name, our wide-body cargo-handling systems are sold to aircraft
    original equipment manufacturers or to airlines and air freight
    carriers as “seller

and/or

buyer
    furnished equipment” for original installations or as
    retrofits for existing equipment. Cargo-handling systems require
    a high degree of engineering sophistication.

Telair International is the exclusive supplier of main deck and
    lower deck cargo systems for the new Boeing

747-8.

Telair is also the exclusive provider of lower deck systems for
    the Airbus A330/A340-200 and 300 aircraft. Airbus is currently
    producing over 80 of these aircraft per year. Telair has been
    selected to supply cargo systems for the Airbus A350 XWB
    airframe when it enters production. Telair is also the exclusive
    supplier of sliding carpet systems for bulk-loading of narrow
    body aircraft such as 737 passenger planes. The Telair
    narrowbody system speeds loading and unloading of baggage and
    cargo to speed turnaround and increase aircraft utilization.
    This system is being installed in new 737’s for American
    Airlines and Continental Airlines, as well as in 737’s and
    the A320 family aircraft for airlines all over the world. Telair
    also provides bin loading systems for Canadair (Bombardier)
    aircraft. In addition to the design and manufacture of cargo
    systems, we provide customers with aftermarket spare parts and
    repair services for their Telair systems.

Cargo
    Containment

We design, manufacture and repair unit loading devices, or ULDs,
    which include both cargo containers and pallets. In November
    2007, we acquired Nordisk Aviation Products, expanding our
    customer base and global manufacturing and service capacity for
    cargo equipment. Nordisk globally has the widest ULD product
    line and specializes in ULDs that either reduce weight or
    maximize cargo volume by closely matching the interior contour
    of the aircraft. In 2009 Nordisk introduced the 55 kg Ultralite
    container, the lightest in its class. Weight reduction is a key
    factor in extending the range of aircraft, increasing payload
    and reducing fuel costs. Nordisk provides global support of its
    products with worldwide spare parts stocking and a network of
    affiliated repair stations.

Actuation

We manufacture and repair actuation devices and components for
    our systems and other related aircraft controls, including
    canopy and door actuators, cargo winches and flight controls.
    Teleflex actuators are used on the Boeing 747, 767 and 737
    aircraft, as well as a number of military and legacy aircraft.
    In 2009, our actuation business won a significant order to
    provide actuation devices for the U.S. Air Force

A-10

wing
    replacement program, as well as new content on the

747-8

and

747-Intercontinental.

GOVERNMENT
    REGULATION

Government agencies in a number of countries regulate our
    products and the products sold by our customers utilizing our
    products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and
    government agencies in other countries regulate the approval,
    manufacturing, and sale and marketing of many of our healthcare
    products. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the
    European Aviation Safety Agency regulate the manufacture and
    sale of some of our aerospace products and license the operation
    of our repair stations. For more information, see Item 1A.
    “Risk Factors.”

COMPETITION

Medical
    Segment

The medical devices industry is highly competitive. We compete
    with many companies, ranging from small

start-up

enterprises to companies that are larger and more established
    than us with access to significant financial resources.
    Furthermore, new product development and technological change
    characterize the market in which we compete. We must continue to
    develop and acquire new products and technologies for our
    Medical Segment businesses to remain competitive. We believe
    that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority
    and innovative features that enhance patient benefit, product
    reliability, performance, customer and sales support, and
    cost-effectiveness.

Aerospace
    and Commercial Segments

The businesses within our Aerospace and Commercial segments
    generally face significant competition from competitors of
    varying sizes. We believe that our competitive position depends
    on the technical competence and creative ability of our
    engineering personnel, the know-how and skill of our
    manufacturing personnel, and the strength and scope of our
    sales, service and distribution networks. Competitors of the
    businesses with our Aerospace Segment include Goodrich
    Corporation, AAR Corp and Driessen Aerospace Group. Competition
    for our Commercial business tends to be fragmented.

SALES AND
    MARKETING

Medical
    Segment

Our medical products are sold directly to hospitals, healthcare
    providers, distributors and to original equipment manufacturers
    of medical devices through our own sales forces and through
    independent representatives and independent distributor networks.

Aerospace
    and Commercial Segments

Products sold to the aerospace market are sold through our own
    field representatives and distributors. The majority of our
    Commercial Segment products are sold through a direct sales
    force of field representatives and technical specialists. Marine
    driver controls and engine and drive parts are sold directly to
    boat builders and engine manufacturers as well as through
    distributors, dealers and retail outlets to reach recreational
    boaters. Rigging products and services includes both a retail
    business and a wholesale business, both of which sell through a
    direct sales force.

BACKLOG

Medical
    Segment

Most of our medical products are sold to hospitals or healthcare
    providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or
    weeks, with longer order times for products sold to medical
    device manufacturers. Therefore, the backlog of our Medical
    Segment orders is not indicative of probable revenues in any
    future

12-month

period.


Aerospace
    Segment

As of December 31, 2009, our backlog of firm orders for our
    Aerospace Segment was $45 million, of which we expect
    approximately 95 percent to be filled in 2010. Our backlog
    for our Aerospace Segment on December 31, 2008 was
    $68 million.

Commercial
    Segment

Standard Commercial Segment products are typically shipped
    between a few days and three months after receipt of order.
    Therefore, the backlog of such orders is not indicative of
    probable revenues in any future

12-month

period.

PATENTS AND
    TRADEMARKS

We own a portfolio of patents, patents pending and trademarks.
    We also license various patents and trademarks. Patents for
    individual products extend for varying periods according to the
    date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in
    the various countries where patent protection is obtained.
    Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of
    time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks.
    All capitalized product names throughout this document are
    trademarks owned by, or licensed to, us or our subsidiaries.
    Although these have been of value and are expected to continue
    to be of value in the future, we do not consider any single
    patent or trademark, except for the Teleflex and Arrow brands,
    to be essential to the operation of our business.

SUPPLIERS AND
    MATERIALS

Materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased
    from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic
    locations. We are not dependent on any single supplier for a
    substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied
    for our overall operations. Most of the materials and components
    we use are available from multiple sources, and where practical,
    we attempt to identify alternative suppliers. Volatility in
    commodity markets, particularly steel and plastic resins, can
    have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of
    our products. We cannot be assured of successfully passing these
    cost increases through to all of our customers, particularly
    original equipment manufacturers.

RESEARCH AND
    DEVELOPMENT

We are engaged in both internal and external research and
    development in our Medical, Aerospace and Commercial segments.
    Nearly 80% of our research and development costs occur in our
    Medical business in connection with our efforts to bring
    innovative new products to the markets we serve, and to enhance
    the clinical value, ease of use, safety and reliability of our
    existing product lines. Our research and development efforts
    support our strategic objectives to provide safe and effective
    products that reduce infections, improve patient and clinician
    safety, enhance patient outcomes and enable less invasive
    procedures.

Research and development in our Aerospace and Commercial
    businesses is focused on the development of lighter, more
    durable and more automated systems and products that facilitate
    cargo loading and containment on commercial aircraft and improve
    the performance of recreational boats.

We also acquire or license products and technologies that are
    consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability
    to provide a full range of product and service options to our
    customers.

SEASONALITY

Portions of our revenues, particularly in the Commercial and
    Medical segments, are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Revenues
    in the marine aftermarket generally increase in the second
    quarter as boat owners prepare their watercraft for the upcoming
    season. Incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as
    the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues
    related to disposable medical products.


EMPLOYEES

We employed approximately 12,700 full-time and temporary
    employees at December 31, 2009. Of these employees,
    approximately 3,900 were employed in the United States and 8,800
    in countries outside of the United States. Less than 8% percent
    of our employees in the United States were covered by union
    contracts. We have government-mandated collective-bargaining
    arrangements or union contracts that cover employees in other
    countries. We believe we have good relationships with our
    employees.

We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934. Therefore, we file reports, proxy
    statements and other information with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission (SEC). Such reports, proxy statements, and

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

We are subject to risks that could adversely affect our
    business, financial condition and results of operations. These
    risks include, but are not limited to the following:

We face significant uncertainty in the industry due to
    government health care reform.

Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the
    health care industry to fundamental changes. We anticipate that
    the current presidential administration, Congress and certain
    state legislatures will continue to review and assess
    alternative health care delivery systems and payment methods
    with an objective of reducing health care costs and expanding
    access. The uncertainties regarding the final legislation and
    its implementation could continue to have an adverse effect on
    our customers’ purchasing decisions regarding our products
    and services. Any legislation enacted could represent
    opportunities and challenges. The potential exists that Medicare
    and Medicaid reimbursement in a variety of health care settings
    could be negatively impacted. Additionally, proposals to tax the
    sale of medical device technologies are being considered in
    Congress. At this juncture in the legislative process, it is not
    possible to determine the final magnitude of the tax or its
    precise structure and implementation. However, should a medical
    device manufacturers’ tax be enacted into law, its impact,
    along with the impact of health care reform to Medicare and
    Medicaid reimbursement as well as other aspects of the various
    reform plans to our industry, could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
    cash flow. At this time, we cannot predict with certainty which,
    if any, health care reform proposals will be adopted, when they
    may be adopted or what impact they may have on us.

Customers in our Medical Segment depend on third party
    reimbursement and the failure of healthcare programs to provide
    reimbursement or the reduction in levels of reimbursement for
    our medical products could adversely affect our Medical
    Segment.

Demand for some of our medical products is affected by the
    extent to which government healthcare programs and private
    health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’
    medical expenses in the countries where we do business.
    Internationally, medical reimbursement systems vary
    significantly, with medical centers in some countries having
    fixed budgets, regardless of the level of patient treatment.
    Other countries require application for, and approval of,
    government or third party reimbursement. Without both favorable
    coverage determinations by, and the financial support of,
    government and third party insurers, the market for some of our
    medical products could be adversely affected.

We cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the
    current level of reimbursement to our customers for use of our
    existing products. Adverse coverage determinations or any
    reduction in the amount of reimbursement could harm our
    business. In addition, as a result of their purchasing power,
    third party payors often seek discounts, price reductions or
    other incentives from medical products suppliers. Our provision
    of such pricing concessions could negatively impact our revenues
    and product margins.

Much of our business is subject to extensive government
    regulation, which may require us to incur significant expenses
    to ensure compliance; our failure to comply with those
    regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results
    of operations and financial condition

Numerous national and local government agencies in a number of
    countries regulate our products. The U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration (“FDA”) and government agencies in
    other countries regulate the approval, manufacturing and sale
    and marketing of many of our medical products. The
    U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the European
    Aviation Safety Agency regulate the manufacture and sale of some
    of our aerospace products and licenses for the operation of our
    repair stations. Failure to comply with applicable regulations
    and quality assurance guidelines could lead to manufacturing
    shutdowns, product shortages, delays in product manufacturing,
    product seizures, recalls, operating restrictions, withdrawal of
    required licenses, prohibitions against exporting of products
    to, or importing products from countries outside the United
    States. In addition, civil and criminal penalties, including
    exclusion under Medicaid or Medicare, could result from
    regulatory


violations. Any one or more of these events could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a
    medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign
    governmental authorities, can be costly and time consuming, and
    approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely
    basis, if at all. The regulatory approval process may result in
    delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial
    additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition and results of operations. Our Medical
    Segment facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA
    and other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities,
    which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to
    certain regulations, including testing, quality control and
    documentation procedures.

On October 11, 2007, Arrow International received a
    corporate warning letter from the FDA, which expresses concerns
    with Arrow’s quality systems, including complaint handling,
    corrective and preventive action, process and design validation
    and inspection and training procedures. While we are working
    with the FDA to resolve these issues, our efforts to address the
    issues raised in the warning letter have required and may
    continue to require the dedication of significant internal and
    external resources. There can be no assurance regarding the
    length of time or cost it will take us to resolve these issues
    to the satisfaction of the FDA. In addition, if our remedial
    actions are not satisfactory to the FDA, we may need to devote
    additional financial and human resources to our efforts, and the
    FDA may take further regulatory actions against us. These
    actions may include seizing our product inventory, obtaining a
    court injunction against further marketing of our products,
    assessing civil monetary penalties or imposing a consent decree
    on us, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining
    to healthcare pricing and fraud and abuse, including
    anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of these laws
    may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including
    substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation
    in federal and state healthcare programs.

In addition, we are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state
    and local environmental protection and health and safety laws
    governing, among other things:

•

the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous
    materials;

•

emissions or discharges of substances into the
    environment; and

•

the health and safety of our employees.

These laws and government regulations are complex, change
    frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time.
    We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with
    current or future environmental protection and health and safety
    laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases
    of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our
    estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition
    and results of operations. Moreover, we may become subject to
    additional environmental claims, which may include claims for
    personal injury or cleanup, based on our past, present or future
    business activities, which could also adversely affect our
    financial condition and results of operations.

Our strategic initiatives may not produce the intended
    growth in revenue and operating income.

We have disclosed operational strategies and initiatives. These
    strategies include making significant investments to achieve
    revenue growth and margin improvement targets. If we do not
    achieve the expected benefits from these investments or
    otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives, we may
    not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our
    results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, as
    part of our strategy for growth, we have made and may continue
    to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic
    alliances such as joint ventures and joint development
    agreements. However, we may not be able to identify suitable
    acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate
    acquisitions successfully, and our


strategic alliances may not prove to be successful. In this
    regard, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including
    difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies,
    services and products of the acquired companies and the
    diversion of management’s attention from other business
    concerns. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the
    risks inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no
    assurance that we will properly ascertain all such risks. In
    addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future
    acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial
    additional indebtedness and other expenses. Future acquisitions
    may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity
    securities. There can be no assurance that difficulties
    encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

We may not be successful in achieving expected operating
    efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense
    reductions, and may experience business disruptions, associated
    with announced restructuring, realignment and cost reduction
    activities.

Over the past few years we have announced several restructuring,
    realignment and cost reduction initiatives, including
    significant realignments of our businesses, employee
    terminations and product rationalizations. While we have started
    to realize the efficiencies of these actions, these activities
    may not produce the full efficiency and cost reduction benefits
    we expect. Further, such benefits may be realized later than
    expected, and the ongoing costs of implementing these measures
    may be greater than anticipated. If these measures are not
    successful or sustainable, we may undertake additional
    realignment and cost reduction efforts, which could result in
    future charges. Moreover, our ability to achieve our other
    strategic goals and business plans may be adversely affected and
    we could experience business disruptions with customers and
    elsewhere if our restructuring and realignment efforts prove
    ineffective.

Our failure to successfully develop new products could
    adversely affect our results.

The medical device industry is characterized by rapid product
    development and technological advances. In addition, while our
    products for the aerospace and commercial industries generally
    have longer life cycles, many of those products require changes
    in design or other enhancements to meet the evolving needs of
    our customers. The future success of our business will depend,
    in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new
    competitive products and to enhance existing products. Our
    product development efforts may require substantial investment
    by us. There can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will
    not occur with respect to the development, performance or market
    acceptance of new technologies or products, such as the
    inability to:

•

identify viable new products;

•

obtain adequate intellectual property protection;

•

gain market acceptance of new products; or

•

successfully obtain regulatory approvals.

Moreover, we may not otherwise be able to successfully develop
    and market new products or enhance existing products. Our
    failure to successfully develop and market new products or
    enhance existing products could reduce our revenues and margins,
    which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

We may incur material losses and costs as a result of
    product liability, warranty, recall and other claims that may be
    brought against us.

Our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks
    that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of
    our products. In particular, our medical device products are
    often used in surgical and intensive care settings with
    seriously ill patients. Many of these products are designed to
    be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time, and
    component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or
    inadequate disclosure of product-related risks with respect to
    these or other products we manufacture or sell could result in
    an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, the patient. In
    addition, our products for the


aerospace and commercial industries are used in potentially
    hazardous environments. Although we carry product liability
    insurance we may be exposed to product liability and warranty
    claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail
    to perform as expected or the use of our products results, or is
    alleged to result, in bodily injury

and/or

property damage. Accordingly, we could experience material
    warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur
    significant costs to defend these claims. In addition, if any of
    our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be
    required to participate in a recall of that product if the
    defect or the alleged defect relates to safety, and we may
    experience lost sales and be exposed to legal and reputational
    risk. Product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

We also are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the
    normal course of business involving contracts, intellectual
    property, import and export regulations, employment and
    environmental matters. The defense of these lawsuits may divert
    our management’s attention, and we may incur significant
    expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be
    required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject
    to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations. While we do not believe that any litigation in
    which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse
    effect, the outcome of litigation, including regulatory matters,
    is often difficult to predict, and we cannot assure that the
    outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
    of operations.

We have substantial debt obligations that could adversely
    impact our business, results of operations and financial
    condition.

As of December 31, 2009, our outstanding indebtedness was
    approximately $1.2 billion. We will be required to use a
    significant portion of our operating cash flow to reduce our
    indebtedness over the next few years. As a result, cash flow
    available to fund working capital, capital expenditures,
    acquisitions, investments and dividends may be limited. Our
    indebtedness may also subject us to greater vulnerability to
    general adverse economic and industry conditions and increase
    our vulnerability to increases in interest rates because a
    portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates.

Our senior credit facility and agreements with the holders of
    our senior notes, which we refer to below as our senior debt
    facilities, impose certain operating and financial covenants
    that could limit our ability to, among other things:

•

incur debt;

•

create liens;

•

consolidate, merge or dispose of assets;

•

make investments;

•

engage in acquisitions

•

pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of
    our capital stock; and

•

enter into derivative agreements to manage exposure to changes
    in interest rates.

In addition, the terms of our senior debt facilities require us
    to comply with a number of covenants, including covenants that
    require us to maintain specified financial ratios, which are
    described in more detail in Item 7, Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be
    affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure
    that, in the event of a significant deterioration of our
    operating results, we will be able to satisfy those ratios. A
    breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under
    our senior debt facilities. If we fail to maintain compliance
    with these covenants and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders
    under the senior debt facilities, the lenders could elect to
    declare all amounts outstanding under the senior debt facilities
    to be immediately due and payable and


terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the
    facilities. If the lenders under the senior debt facilities
    accelerate the repayment of borrowings and we are not able to
    obtain financing to enable repayment, we likely would have to
    liquidate significant assets, which nevertheless may not be
    sufficient to repay our borrowings.

We are subject to risks associated with our

non-U.S.

operations.

Although no material concentration of our manufacturing
    operations exists in any single country, we have significant
    manufacturing operations outside the United States, including
    operations conducted through entities that are not wholly-owned.
    As of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2009,
    approximately 41% of our total fixed assets and 46% of our total
    net revenues were attributable to products directly distributed
    from our operations outside the U.S. Our international
    operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in
    doing business outside the U.S., including:

•

exchange controls, currency restrictions and fluctuations in
    currency values;

•

trade protection measures;

•

import or export requirements;

•

subsidies or increased access to capital for firms who are
    currently or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we
    have operations;

•

potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;

•

restrictions and taxes related to the repatriation of foreign
    earnings;

•

differing labor regulations;

•

differing protection of intellectual property;

•

unsettled political and economic conditions and possible
    terrorist attacks against American interests.

These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on
    our international operations or on our business, results of
    operations and financial condition generally.

Foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and
    interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our
    results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the
    effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity
    prices and interest rates. We expect revenue from products
    manufactured in, and sold into,

non-U.S. markets

to continue to represent a significant portion of our net
    revenue. Our consolidated financial statements reflect
    translation of financial statements denominated in

non-U.S. currencies

to U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. When the
    U.S. dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the
    foreign currencies of the countries where we sell or manufacture
    our products, such as the euro, our U.S. dollar-reported
    revenue and income will fluctuate. Although we have entered into
    forward contracts with several major financial institutions to
    hedge a portion of projected cash flows denominated in
    non-functional currency in order to reduce the effects of
    currency rate fluctuations, changes in the relative values of
    currencies may, in some instances, have a significant effect on
    our results of operations.

Many of our products have significant steel and plastic resin
    content. We also use quantities of other commodities, including
    copper and zinc. Although we monitor our exposure to these
    commodity price increases as an integral part of our overall
    risk management program, volatility in the prices of these
    commodities could increase the costs of our products and
    services. We may not be able to pass on these costs to our
    customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations and cash flows.


Fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax
    laws may adversely affect our results.

As a company with significant operations outside of the U.S., we
    are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other
    jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived
    from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various
    countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
    In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of
    tax that will become payable in each of the countries, states
    and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax
    rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the
    past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of
    our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting
    for income taxes and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors
    could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly
    different from previous periods or our current expectations,
    which could have an adverse effect on our business and results
    of operations. In addition, unfavorable results of tax audits
    and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate,
    among other things, could adversely affect our results of
    operations and cash flows.

An interruption in our manufacturing operations may
    adversely affect our business.

Many of our key products across all three of our business
    segments are manufactured at single locations, with limited
    alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in damage
    to one or more of our facilities, it may not be possible to
    timely manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or
    at all. In addition, with respect to our Medical Segment, due to
    the stringent regulations and requirements of the FDA and other
    regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our
    products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or
    replacement sources for certain components or materials. A
    reduction or interruption in manufacturing, or an inability to
    secure alternative sources of raw materials or components that
    are acceptable to us, could have an adverse effect on our
    results of operations and financial condition.

Further adverse developments in general domestic and
    global economic conditions combined with a continuation of
    volatile global credit markets could adversely impact our
    operating results, financial condition and liquidity.

We are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general
    domestic and global economic conditions, including recession or
    economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets. The credit
    and capital markets experienced extreme volatility and
    disruption over the past year, leading to recessionary
    conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial
    spending. These recessionary conditions have caused customers to
    reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products
    and services. While recent indicators suggest modest improvement
    in the United States and global economy, we cannot predict the
    timing or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which
    our customers will return to more normalized spending behaviors.
    If the recessionary conditions continue or worsen, our customers
    may terminate existing purchase orders or reduce the volume of
    products or services they purchase from us in the future.
    Adverse economic and financial market conditions may also cause
    our suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments to us or
    may cause suppliers to make changes in the credit terms they
    extend to us, such as shortening the required payment period for
    outstanding accounts receivable or reducing the maximum amount
    of trade credit available to us. These types of actions by our
    suppliers could significantly affect our liquidity and could
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
    financial condition. If we are unable to successfully anticipate
    changing economic and financial market conditions, we may be
    unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and
    our business could be negatively affected.

In addition, the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets
    on our consolidated balance sheet have increased significantly
    in recent years, primarily as a result of the acquisition of
    Arrow International in 2007. Adverse economic and financial
    market conditions may result in future charges to recognize
    impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other
    intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial results.


Our technology is important to our success, and our
    failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive
    disadvantage.

Because many of our products rely on proprietary technology, we
    believe that the development and protection of our intellectual
    property rights is important, though not essential, to the
    future success of our business. In addition to relying on our
    patents, trademarks and copyrights, we rely on confidentiality
    agreements with employees and other measures to protect our
    know-how and trade secrets. Despite our efforts to protect
    proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy
    or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology. The
    steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of this
    technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may
    not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the
    U.S. Moreover, there can be no assurance that others will
    not independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or
    develop better technology than ours or that current and former
    employees, contractors and other parties will not breach
    confidentiality agreements, misappropriate proprietary
    information and copy or otherwise obtain and use our information
    and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise
    infringe on our intellectual property rights. Our inability to
    protect our proprietary technology could result in competitive
    harm that could adversely affect our business.

We depend upon relationships with physicians and other
    health care professionals.

The research and development of some of our products is
    dependent on our maintaining strong working relationships with
    physicians and other health care professionals. We rely on these
    professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and
    experience regarding our products and the development of our
    products. Physicians assist us as researchers, product
    consultants, inventors and as public speakers. If we fail to
    maintain our working relationships with physicians and receive
    the benefits of their knowledge, advice and input, our products
    may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and
    expectations of the professionals who use and support our
    products, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar
    agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of
    services.

Approximately 13% of our net revenues are generated by
    operations for which a significant part of our workforce is
    covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar
    agreements in foreign jurisdictions. It is likely that a portion
    of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining
    and similar agreements for the foreseeable future. Strikes or
    work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our
    relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our
    business.

    these properties for sale or sublease. At December 31,
    2009, the unused owned properties were classified as held for
    sale.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

On October 11, 2007, the Company’s subsidiary, Arrow
    International, Inc. (“Arrow”), received a corporate
    warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
    (FDA). The letter cited three site-specific warning letters
    issued by the FDA in 2005 and subsequent inspections performed
    from June 2005 to February 2007 at Arrow’s facilities in
    the United States. The letter expressed concerns with
    Arrow’s quality systems, including complaint handling,
    corrective and preventive action, process and design validation,
    inspection and training procedures. It also advised that
    Arrow’s corporate-wide program to evaluate, correct and
    prevent quality system issues has been deficient. Limitations on
    pre-market approvals and certificates for foreign governments
    had


previously been imposed on Arrow based on prior inspections and
    the corporate warning letter did not impose additional sanctions
    that are expected to have a material financial impact on the
    Company.

In connection with its acquisition of Arrow, completed on
    October 1, 2007, the Company developed an integration plan
    that included the commitment of significant resources to correct
    these previously-identified regulatory issues and further
    improve overall quality systems. Senior management officials
    from the Company have met with FDA representatives, and a
    comprehensive written corrective action plan was presented to
    FDA in late 2007. At the end of 2009, the FDA began its
    reinspections of the Arrow facilities covered by the corporate
    warning letter. These inspections have been substantially
    completed, and the FDA has issued certain written observations
    to Arrow as a result of those inspections. We are currently in
    the process of responding to those observations and
    communicating with the FDA regarding resolution of all
    outstanding issues.

While the Company continues to believe it has substantially
    remediated these issues through the corrective actions taken to
    date, there can be no assurances that these issues have been
    resolved to the satisfaction of the FDA. If the Company’s
    remedial actions are not satisfactory to the FDA, the Company
    may have to devote additional financial and human resources to
    its efforts, and the FDA may take further regulatory actions
    against the Company.

In addition, we are a party to various lawsuits and claims
    arising in the normal course of business. These lawsuits and
    claims include actions involving product liability, intellectual
    property, employment and environmental matters. Based on
    information currently available, advice of counsel, established
    reserves and other resources, we do not believe that any such
    actions are likely to be, individually or in the aggregate,
    material to our business, financial condition, results of
    operations or liquidity. However, in the event of unexpected
    further developments, it is possible that the ultimate
    resolution of these matters, or other similar matters, if
    unfavorable, may be materially adverse to our business,
    financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Various senior and term note agreements provide for the
    maintenance of certain financial ratios and limit the repurchase
    of our stock and payment of cash dividends. Under the most
    restrictive of these provisions, on an annual basis
    $223 million of retained earnings was available for
    dividends and stock repurchases at December 31, 2009. On
    February 23, 2010, the Board of Directors declared a
    quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share on our common stock, which
    is payable on March 15, 2010 to holders of record on
    March 3, 2010. As of February 23, 2010, we had
    approximately 804 holders of record of our common stock.

On June 14, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of
    outstanding Company common stock. Through December 31,
    2009, no shares have been purchased under this Board
    authorization. See “Stock Repurchase Programs”
    contained in the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” on page 42 for
    more information.


The following graph provides a comparison of five year
    cumulative total stockholder returns of Teleflex common stock,
    the Standard & Poor (S&P) 500 Stock Index and the
    S&P MidCap 400 Index. We have selected the S&P MidCap
    400 Index because, due to the diverse nature of our businesses,
    we do not believe that there exists a relevant published
    industry or line-of-business index and do not believe we can
    reasonably identify a peer group. The annual changes for the
    five-year period shown on the graph are based on the assumption
    that $100 had been invested in Teleflex common stock and each
    index on December 31, 2004 and that all dividends were
    reinvested.

Free cash flow is calculated by reducing cash provided by
    operating activities from continuing operations by capital
    expenditures. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial
    measure. We use this financial measure for internal managerial
    purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future
    results, and to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. This
    financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with
    results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be
    relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.
    Management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to
    investors because it facilitates an assessment of funds
    available to satisfy current and future obligations, pay
    dividends and fund acquisitions. Free cash flow is not a measure
    of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the
    Company has certain non-discretionary obligations, such as debt
    service, that are not deducted from the measure. Management
    strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements
    and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on
    any single financial measure. The following is a reconciliation
    of free cash flow to the nearest GAAP measure as required under
    the Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Overview

Teleflex strives to maintain a portfolio of businesses that
    provide consistency of performance, improved profitability and
    sustainable growth. We are focused on achieving consistent and
    sustainable growth through our internal growth initiatives,
    which include the development of new products, expansion of
    market share, moving existing products into new geographies, and
    through selected acquisitions which enhance or expedite our
    development initiatives and our ability to grow market share.

Over the past several years, we significantly changed the
    composition of our portfolio through acquisitions, principally
    in our Medical Segment, and divestitures in both our Aerospace
    and Commercial segments. These portfolio actions resulted in a
    significant expansion of our Medical Segment operations and a
    significant reduction in our Aerospace and Commercial Segment
    operations. As a result, our Medical Segment now accounts for
    over 75% of our revenues from continuing operations and over 90%
    of our segment operating profit. The following bullet points
    summarize our more significant acquisitions and divestitures,
    which occurred in 2007 and 2009. The results for the acquired
    businesses are included in the respective segments. See
    Notes 3 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information regarding our significant
    acquisitions and divestitures.

Medical
    Segment

•

October 2007 —

Acquired Arrow International,
    Inc., a leading global supplier of catheter-based medical
    technology products used for vascular access and cardiac care,
    for approximately $2.1 billion.

•

April 2007

— Acquired substantially all of the
    assets of HDJ Company, Inc., providers of engineering and
    manufacturing services to medical device manufacturers, for
    approximately $25 million.

Commercial
    Segment

•

September 2009

— Divested business units that
    design and manufacture heavy-duty truck and locomotive auxiliary
    power units, truck and bus climate control systems, and
    components and systems for the use of alternative fuels in
    industrial vehicles and passenger cars with 2008 annual revenues
    of approximately $97 million, for approximately
    $14.5 million in cash.

•

December 2007

— Divested business units that
    design and manufacture automotive and industrial driver
    controls, motion systems and fluid handling systems (the
    “GMS Businesses”) with 2007 revenues of over
    $860 million, for $560 million in cash.

•

April 2007

— Acquired substantially all of the
    assets of Southern Wire Corporation, a wholesale distributor of
    wire rope cables and related hardware, for approximately
    $20 million.

Aerospace
    Segment

•

March 2009

— Divested our 51% interest in
    Airfoil Technologies International Singapore Pte. Ltd.
    (“ATI Singapore”), which provides engine repair
    technologies and services primarily for critical components of
    flight turbines, including fan blades, compressors and airfoils,
    with 2008 annual revenues of approximately $257 million,
    for approximately $300 million in cash.

•

November 2007

— Acquired Nordisk Aviation
    Products A/S, a global leader in developing, manufacturing, and
    servicing containers and pallets for air cargo, for
    approximately $32 million.


•

June 2007

— Divested Teleflex Aerospace
    Manufacturing Group (“TAMG”), a precision-machined
    components business with 2006 revenues of approximately
    $130 million, for approximately $134 million in cash.

We incurred significant indebtedness to fund a portion of the
    consideration for our October 2007 acquisition of Arrow. As of
    December 31, 2009, our outstanding indebtedness was
    approximately $1.2 billion, down from $1.5 billion as
    of December 31, 2008, primarily due to the use of
    $240 million of the proceeds from the sale of the ATI
    businesses to repay and reduce indebtedness. For additional
    information regarding our indebtedness, please see
    “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below and
    Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in
    this Annual Report on Form

10-K.

Global Economic
    Conditions

The global recessionary conditions that prevailed throughout
    2009 have had an adverse impact on market activities including,
    among other things, failure of financial institutions, falling
    asset values, diminished liquidity, and reduced demand for
    products and services. At Teleflex, these economic developments
    principally affected our Aerospace and Commercial Segments
    during 2009, and, in response, we adjusted production levels and
    engaged in new restructuring activities. Although, on a
    consolidated basis, the economic conditions did not have a
    significant adverse impact on our financial position, results of
    operations or liquidity during 2009, the continuation of the
    broad economic trends could adversely affect our operations in
    the future, as described below. The potential effect of these
    factors on our current and future liquidity is discussed below
    under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.”

Medical —

Our Medical Segment serves a
    diverse base of hospitals and healthcare providers in more than
    140 countries. Healthcare policies and practice trends vary by
    country, and the impact of the global economic downturn was
    primarily felt in our U.S. and Asian markets during 2009.
    European healthcare markets were less affected due to the
    predominantly public funding mechanisms in those systems.

Hospitals in some regions of the United States experienced a
    decline in admissions, a weaker payor mix, and a reduction in
    elective procedures. Hospitals consequently took actions to
    reduce their costs, including limiting their capital spending,
    and distributors in the supply chain reduced inventory levels
    during 2009. The impact of these actions were most pronounced in
    capital goods markets, which affected our surgical instrument
    and cardiac assist businesses, and in the orthopedic sector
    which impacted our orthopedic OEM business. Approximately
    80 percent of our Medical revenues come from disposable
    products used in critical care and surgical applications, and
    our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital
    admission rates or payor mix decline further as a result of
    continuing high unemployment rates (and subsequent loss of
    insurance coverage by consumers).

Although the impact of the global recession outside the United
    States has been less pronounced to date, funding for foreign
    healthcare institutions could be affected in the future as
    governments make further spending adjustments and enact versions
    of healthcare reform to lower overall healthcare costs. During
    2009, the public healthcare systems in certain countries in
    Western Europe, most notably Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy,
    have experienced reduced liquidity due to recessionary
    conditions which has resulted in a slow down in payments to us.
    We believe this situation will be with us until these countries
    are able to find alternative funding sources to their respective
    public healthcare sectors. In 2009, sales into the public
    hospital systems in these countries were approximately 4% of our
    total sales.

Distributors in certain Asian markets were negatively impacted
    by credit availability and large swings in currency values early
    in 2009 but returned to more normal order patterns later in the
    year.


Significant fundamental changes are currently being proposed to
    the healthcare system in the U.S. The U.S. House of
    Representatives and Senate passed versions of health care reform
    legislation late in 2009. The bills in their current form
    contain provisions that (i) mandate health insurance
    coverage, (ii) introduce various insurance market reforms
    and (iii) seek to finance the cost of health care reform by
    reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and the levy
    of a variety of payroll taxes and fees on individuals and
    employers, including the imposition of fees on medical device
    manufacturers, such as Teleflex. The potential impact of these
    reforms remains uncertain. The addition of significant numbers
    of currently uninsured patients into the healthcare system could
    spur additional volume demand for our products. However,
    reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement could
    negatively affect pricing. We continue to study the evolution of
    the House and Senate bills, but until legislation is passed in
    final form, we will be unable to ascertain the anticipated
    impact on Teleflex.

•

Aerospace —

Sudden and significant
    increases in fuel costs in mid-2008 resulted in reductions in
    capacity for passenger and cargo traffic, and accelerated
    retirement of older, less fuel efficient aircraft. These trends
    were exacerbated by the economic crisis in 2009 even though fuel
    prices have decreased from these record levels. The sharp drop
    in fuel costs toward the end of 2008 was a positive development
    for airlines, as it offset somewhat the recession related drop
    in revenues for both passenger and cargo traffic. Although lower
    traffic makes it more difficult to sell cargo containment
    equipment due to reduced demand, new aircraft production and
    weight and greenhouse gas reduction objectives create some
    opportunities in these markets. Despite the fact that our
    installed base of equipment continues to grow, short term lower
    overall aircraft utilization will reduce demand for spare parts
    and repair services in all three of our Aerospace businesses.
    Nevertheless, we are well positioned on certain new Airbus and
    Boeing airframes and deliveries of cargo handling systems are
    expected to continue at previously expected levels overall,
    albeit on a slightly longer time horizon than what we initially
    anticipated.

•

Commercial —

The markets served by our
    Commercial Segment are largely affected by the general state of
    the economy and by consumer confidence. Factors such as housing
    starts, home values, fuel costs, environmental and other
    regulatory matters all affect the market outlook for the
    businesses in this segment. Very high fuel prices in 2008 began
    a trend of declining demand in the recreational marine market
    and the global recession that followed caused this trend to
    continue in 2009 in spite of moderating fuel costs. Although we
    experienced continued softness in the markets for new boats,
    aftermarket sales of replacement parts grew in the second half
    of 2009. Our rigging services business was adversely impacted by
    sharp drops in construction activity and in oil and gas
    exploration in 2009. We expect that growth will be a challenge
    in our Commercial Segment until there is a return to global
    economic growth and improvement in consumer confidence.

Results of
    Operations

Discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a
    purchased company for up to twelve months beyond the date of
    acquisition. Activity beyond the initial twelve months is
    considered core growth. Core growth excludes the impact of
    translating the results of international subsidiaries at
    different currency exchange rates from year to year and the
    comparable activity of divested companies within the most recent
    twelve-month period.


The following comparisons exclude the impact of the operations
    of the ATI businesses, Power Systems, TAMG, and the GMS
    businesses which have been presented in our consolidated
    financial results as discontinued operations (see Note 18
    to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

and “Discontinued Operations” in this
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” for discussion of
    discontinued operations).

Revenues




(Dollars in millions)

Net revenues

$

1,575.1

Net revenues decreased approximately 9% to $1.89 billion in
    2009 from $2.07 billion in 2008. Reduced revenues from core
    business caused 6% of the decline while foreign currency
    movements caused the other 3% of the decline. As a result of 2%
    core growth in the fourth quarter in the Medical Segment, core
    revenue in that segment was flat in 2009 compared to 2008, but
    core revenue declined in the Aerospace and Commercial segments
    24% and 17%, respectively in 2009 compared to 2008. Weak global
    economic conditions have negatively impacted markets served by
    our Aerospace and Commercial segments throughout 2009.

Net revenues increased approximately 31% to $2.07 billion
    in 2008 from $1.58 billion in 2007. Businesses acquired in
    2008 accounted for almost all of this increase in revenues, as
    foreign currency translation contributed 1% to revenue growth,
    while revenues from core business were essentially unchanged
    compared to 2007. Core revenue growth in the Medical (2%) and
    Aerospace (1%) segments was offset by a 9% decline in core
    revenues in the Commercial Segment, which was primarily due to a
    significant decrease in sales of recreational marine products.

Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 43.1% in
    2009 from 41.4% in 2008 with all three segments experiencing
    increases in gross profit as a percentage of revenues. The
    principal factors that impact the overall increase were a higher
    percentage of Medical revenues (77% of total revenues in 2009
    compared to 73% in 2008), a $7 million fair value
    adjustment to inventory in the first quarter of 2008 related to
    inventory acquired in the Arrow acquisition, which did not recur
    in 2009, synergies from the Arrow acquisition and manufacturing
    cost reductions implemented in each of our three segments,
    partly offset by higher pension expense in 2009 because of the
    decline in the value of our pension assets at the end of 2008 as
    a result of losses experienced in the global equity markets.

Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 41.4% in
    2008 from 37.6% in 2007. This trend was driven by increases in
    the Medical and Aerospace segments as the gross profit
    percentage in the Commercial Segment was unchanged from 2007.
    Improved margins in the Medical Segment were largely due to the
    inclusion of higher margin Arrow critical care product lines for
    the full year in 2008 compared to only the fourth quarter in
    2007 and volume related manufacturing efficiencies in the
    Medical OEM product line. Improved margins in the Aerospace
    Segment were principally due to a shift in sales favoring engine
    repair services and away from sales of lower margin replacement
    parts in the engine repairs business.

Selling, engineering and administrative expenses (operating
    expenses) as a percentage of revenues were 27.5% in 2009
    compared to 27.2% in 2008. The increase in the amount as a
    percentage of revenues is due to the

year-on-year

decline in revenues. The reduction in the dollar value of these
    costs was principally the result of cost reduction initiatives
    throughout the Company, including restructuring and integration
    activities in connection with the Arrow acquisition and the 2008
    Commercial segment restructuring program, and lower spending on
    remediation of FDA regulatory issues. These factors resulted in
    an aggregate reduction in expenses of approximately
    $45 million.

Selling, engineering and administrative expenses as a percentage
    of revenues were 27.2% in 2008 compared to 25.9% in 2007,
    principally due to approximately $25 million higher
    amortization expense related to the Arrow acquisition and
    approximately $20 million higher expenses in the Medical
    Segment related to the remediation of FDA regulatory issues.

In 2009, we performed an interim review of goodwill for our

    result of the difficult market conditions confronting the Cargo
    Container reporting unit and the significant deterioration in
    its operating performance, which accelerated in the second
    quarter of 2009. Upon conclusion of this review, we determined
    that goodwill in the Cargo Container operations was impaired,
    and we recorded an impairment charge of $6.7 million in the
    second quarter of 2009.

In 2007, we recorded a $2.4 million goodwill impairment
    charge related to a write-down to the agreed selling price of
    one of our variable interest entities in the Commercial Segment.

The $30.0 million write-off of in-process research and
    development costs in 2007 is related to in-process R&D
    projects acquired in the Arrow acquisition which we determined
    had no alternative future use in their current state.

Interest expense decreased in 2009 due to an approximate

    reflecting the $240 million of debt repaid in the first
    quarter of 2009 from the proceeds of the sale of the ATI
    business.

Interest expense increased significantly in 2008 compared to
    2007 principally as a result of the full year impact of the debt
    incurred in connection with the Arrow acquisition in October
    2007. Interest income decreased in 2008 compared to 2007
    primarily due to lower amounts of invested funds combined with
    lower average interest rates.


Taxes on

The effective tax rate in 2009 was 21.8% compared to 32.6% in
    2008. Taxes on income from continuing operations in 2009 were
    $39.9 million compared to $47.5 million in 2008. The
    decrease in the effective tax rate was due to (i) a
    decrease in deferred state tax liabilities driven by changes to
    applicable state tax laws and (ii) a reduction in the
    current year for reserves for uncertain tax positions as audits
    and settlements were closed, and fewer new reserves were
    established than in the prior year.

The effective tax rate in 2008 was 32.6% compared to 140.4% in
    2007. Taxes on income from continuing operations of
    $109.9 million in 2007 include discrete income tax charges
    incurred in connection with the Arrow acquisition. Specifically,
    in connection with funding the acquisition of Arrow, the Company
    (i) repatriated approximately $197.0 million of cash
    from foreign subsidiaries which had previously been deemed to be
    permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions;
    and (ii) changed its position with respect to certain
    additional previously untaxed foreign earnings to treat these
    earnings as no longer permanently reinvested. These items
    resulted in a discrete income tax charge in 2007 of
    approximately $80.9 million. The Company did not incur
    similar charges in 2009 or 2008.

In December 2008, we began certain restructuring initiatives
    that affect the Commercial Segment. These initiatives involved
    the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in
    workforce at three of our facilities in Europe and North
    America. We implemented these initiatives as a means to address
    an expected continuation of weakness in the marine and
    industrial markets. These costs amounted to approximately
    $2.2 million during 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we
    have completed the 2008 Commercial Segment restructuring
    program. We expect to have realized annual pre-tax savings of
    between $3.5 - $4.5 million in 2010 as a result of actions
    taken in connection with this program.

In connection with the acquisition of Arrow during 2007, we
    formulated a plan related to the integration of Arrow and our
    other Medical businesses. The integration plan focused on the
    closure of Arrow corporate functions and the consolidation of
    manufacturing, sales, marketing, and distribution functions in
    North America, Europe and Asia. Costs related to actions that
    affect employees and facilities of Arrow have been included in
    the allocation of the purchase price of Arrow. Costs related to
    actions that affect employees and facilities of Teleflex are
    charged to earnings and included in restructuring and impairment
    charges within the consolidated statement of operations. These
    costs amounted to approximately $7.0 million during 2009.
    As of December 31, 2009, we estimate that the aggregate of
    future restructuring and impairment charges that we will incur
    in connection with the Arrow integration plan are approximately
    $1.3 — $2.3 million in 2010. Of this amount,
    $1.0 — $1.5 million relates to employee
    termination costs, $0.2 — $0.5 million relates to
    contract termination costs associated with the termination of
    leases and certain distribution agreements and $0.1 —
    $0.3 million relates to other restructuring costs. We also
    have incurred restructuring related costs in the Medical Segment
    which do not qualify for classification as restructuring costs.
    In 2009 these costs amounted to


$2.5 million and are reported in the Medical Segment’s
    operating results in materials, labor and other product costs
    and in selling, engineering and administrative expenses. We
    expect to have realized annual pre-tax savings of between
    $70-$75 million by the end of 2010 when these integration
    and restructuring actions are complete.

In June 2006, we began certain restructuring initiatives that
    affected all three of our operating segments. These initiatives
    involved the consolidation of operations and a related reduction
    in workforce at several of our facilities in Europe and North
    America. We took these initiatives as a means to improving
    operating performance and to better leverage our existing
    resources and these activities are now complete.

For additional information regarding our restructuring programs,
    see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

During the second quarter of 2009, we recorded $2.3 million
    in impairment charges with respect to an intangible asset in our
    Commercial Segment. During the third quarter of 2009, we
    recorded a $3.3 million impairment charge related to our
    investment in a California real estate venture. In 2004, we
    contributed property and other assets that had been part of one
    of our former manufacturing sites to the real estate venture.
    During the third quarter of 2009, based on continued
    deterioration in the California real estate market, we concluded
    that our investment was not recoverable and recorded the
    impairment charge to fully write-off our investment in this
    venture.

Impairment charges in 2008 included $2.7 million related to
    five of our minority held investments precipitated by the
    deteriorating economic conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008,
    $0.8 million related to an intangible asset in the
    Commercial Segment that was identified during the annual
    impairment testing process, and a $0.2 million reduction in
    the carrying value of a building held for sale. In 2007, we
    determined that two minority-held investments and a building
    held for sale were impaired and recorded an aggregate charge of
    $3.9 million.

    Additional information regarding our segments, including a
    reconciliation of segment operating profit to income from
    continuing operations before interest, taxes and minority
    interest, is presented in Note 17 to our consolidated
    financial statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Medical

Comparison of
    2009 and 2008

Medical Segment net revenues declined 3% in 2009 to
    $1,457.1 million, from $1,499.1 million in 2008,
    entirely due to foreign currency fluctuations, mainly the
    stronger U.S. dollar against the Euro during the first
    three quarters of 2009. In the aggregate, we experienced no
    growth in core revenue in 2009 over 2008, as growth in critical
    care products in Europe and Asia/Latin America of approximately
    $11 million was offset by approximately $9 million
    lower sales of orthopedic instrumentation products to OEMs in
    North America and approximately $8 million lower sales of
    surgical products in North America and Europe.

Net sales for 2009, 2008 and 2007 by product group for the
    Medical Segment are comprised of the following:

Disposable
    Medical Products for Critical Care

The decrease in critical care product sales during 2009 compared
    to 2008 was entirely due to currency fluctuations as core
    revenue in this product group increased approximately 1% in
    2009. Higher sales of vascular access, urology and anesthesia
    products of approximately $12 million were partially offset
    by approximately $6 million lower sales of respiratory
    products, principally as a result of distributor de-stocking in
    North America in early 2009.


Surgical
    Instruments and Medical Devices

Surgical product sales declined approximately 4% in 2009
    compared to 2008. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted
    sales by approximately 3%, and lower sales in the
    instrumentation product line in Europe and North America led the
    1% decline in core revenue. We believe this decline in sales
    resulted from hospitals limiting their capital budgets for these
    products and distributors reducing inventory in the supply chain.

Cardiac Care
    Devices

The decrease in sales of cardiac care products in 2009 compared
    to 2008 is mainly due to currency movements, hospital capital
    budget constraints and a voluntary product recall during the
    first quarter of 2009.

Devices for
    Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”)

Sales of devices to OEMs decreased primarily as a result of
    approximately $9 million lower sales of orthopedic
    instrumentation as higher sales of specialty sutures and other
    devices of approximately $2 million was offset by the
    impact of currency movements. A reduction in new product
    launches by OEM customers and overall weakness in OEM orthopedic
    markets due to hospital budgetary constraints and postponement
    of certain elective surgical procedures have had a negative
    impact on demand for our orthopedic instrumentation products.

Operating profit in the Medical Segment increased 7% in 2009 to
    $305.1 million, from $286.3 million in 2008. The
    negative impact on operating profit from a stronger
    U.S. dollar during the first three quarters of 2009 was
    more than offset by approximately $20 million of lower
    manufacturing and selling, general and administrative costs
    during 2009 as a result of cost reduction initiatives, including
    restructuring and integration activities in connection with the
    Arrow acquisition, and approximately $18 million lower
    expenses related to the remediation of FDA regulatory issues.
    Also, a $7 million expense for fair value adjustment to
    inventory in the first quarter of 2008 related to inventory
    acquired in the Arrow acquisition, which did not recur in 2009,
    had a favorable impact on the comparison of 2009 operating
    profit to the prior year.

During the first quarter 2010, we undertook a voluntary recall
    of our custom IV tubing product. Estimated costs to be
    incurred for the recall are in a range of approximately
    $4.5 million to $7.5 million, pretax. Of that amount,
    $1.7 million relates to units sold or produced in 2009 and
    is included in materials, labor and other product costs in the
    2009 consolidated statement of income.

Comparison of
    2008 and 2007

Medical Segment net revenues grew 44% in 2008 to
    $1,499.1 million, from $1,041.3 million in 2007. The
    acquisition of Arrow accounted for 40% of this increase in
    revenues. Of the remaining 4% increase in net revenues, 2% was
    due to foreign currency fluctuations and 2% was due to core
    revenue growth. Medical Segment core revenue growth in 2008
    reflects higher sales volume for critical care and surgical
    products in Europe and Asia/Latin America of approximately
    $13 million and $8 million, respectively, and a
    $17 million increase in sales of specialty medical devices
    to OEMs, partially offset by $23 million lower sales
    volumes for critical care and surgical products in North America.

Operating profit in the Medical Segment increased 57% in 2008 to
    $286.3 million, from $182.6 million in 2007,
    principally due to the addition of higher margin Arrow critical
    care product lines. Other factors that contributed to the higher
    operating profit were improved cost and operational efficiencies
    in North America, higher volumes in Europe and Asia/Latin
    America, lower fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in
    the Arrow acquisition ($7 million in 2008 versus
    $29 million in 2007) and the favorable impact from the
    stronger Euro. The impact of these factors was partially offset
    by the impact of approximately $25 million higher
    amortization expense related to the Arrow acquisition and
    $20 million in higher costs incurred in 2008 in connection
    with a plan to remediate FDA regulatory issues.


Aerospace

Comparison of
    2009 and 2008

Aerospace Segment net revenues declined 27% in 2009 to
    $185.1 million, from $253.8 million in 2008. Core
    revenue reductions accounted for nearly all (24%) of the decline
    in revenue. Weakness in the commercial aviation sector
    throughout 2009 resulted in reduced sales to commercial airlines
    and freight carriers of wide body cargo spare components and
    repairs, cargo containers and actuators. This market weakness
    has also reduced the number of aftermarket cargo system
    conversions, resulting in lower sales of multi-deck wide body
    cargo handling systems, which offset the impact of higher sales
    of single deck wide body systems on passenger aircraft.

Segment operating profit decreased 41% in 2009 to
    $15.4 million, from $26.1 million in 2008. This
    decline was principally due to the sharply lower sales volumes
    across all product lines, including the unfavorable mix in 2009
    of lower margin single deck system sales compared with a mix in
    2008 that was weighted more toward aftermarket multi-deck system
    conversions and spares and repairs. The impact from lower sales
    volumes was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives that
    resulted in operating cost reductions of approximately
    $9 million during 2009.

Comparison of
    2008 and 2007

Aerospace Segment net revenues grew 28% in 2008 to
    $253.8 million, from $197.8 million in 2007. The
    expansion of the cargo containers product line due to the
    acquisition of Nordisk Aviation Products accounted for 24% of
    this increase. The 1% increase in core growth is primarily
    attributable to increased sales of narrow body cargo loading
    systems and wide body and narrow body cargo spare components and
    repairs.

Segment operating profit increased 43% in 2008 to
    $26.1 million, from $18.3 million in 2007. The
    increase was principally due to the impact of the Nordisk
    acquisition and favorable product mix of repair versus
    replacement in the engine repair services business as a result
    of technology investments we have made. Consolidation of
    operations and phasing out of lower margin product lines in the
    engine repair services business during 2007 also had a positive
    impact on operating profit in 2008.

Commercial

Comparison of
    2009 and 2008

Commercial Segment net revenues declined approximately 21% in
    2009 to $247.9 million, from $313.8 million in 2008.
    Core revenue reductions accounted for 17% of the decline, which
    was principally the result of a decrease in demand for rigging
    services (7%), and a decline in sales of marine products to OEM
    manufacturers for the recreational boat market (15%), partially
    offset by approximately $20 million of higher sales of the
    modern burner unit to the U.S. Military.

In 2009, segment operating profit decreased 42% to
    $15.2 million compared to $26.1 million in 2008. This
    decrease was principally due to the lower sales volumes of
    rigging products and marine products to OEM manufacturers for
    the recreational boat market and sale of higher cost inventory
    in the rigging services business, which more than offset the
    impact from the elimination of approximately $8 million of
    operating costs in 2009 and higher sales of the modern burner
    unit to the U.S. Military.

Comparison of
    2008 and 2007

Commercial Segment net revenues declined approximately 7% in
    2008 to $313.8 million, from $336.0 million in 2007.
    Core revenue declined 9% as a result of a 12% decline in sales
    of marine products for the recreational boat market offset by a
    3% increase in sales of rigging services products. Extreme
    volatility in fuel costs, accompanied by deterioration in the
    general state of the global economy in the second half of 2008
    adversely impacted the markets served by our marine products.


In 2008, segment operating profit decreased 19% to
    $26.1 million compared to $32.0 million in 2007. This
    decrease was principally due to a lower operating profit in the
    marine business resulting from lower sales in 2008 and
    unfavorable currency impact of approximately $3 million
    partially offset by an increase in the rigging services business
    due to an acquisition during 2007.

Discontinued
    Operations

During the third quarter of 2009, we completed the sale of our
    Power Systems operations to Fuel Systems Solutions, Inc. for
    $14.5 million and realized a loss of $3.3 million, net
    of tax. During the second quarter, we recognized a non-cash
    goodwill impairment charge of $25.1 million to adjust the
    carrying value of these operations to their estimated fair
    value. In the third quarter of 2009, we reported the Power
    Systems operations, including the goodwill impairment charge, in
    discontinued operations.

On March 20, 2009, we completed the sale of our
    51 percent ownership interest in ATI Singapore to GE
    Pacific Private Limited for $300 million in cash. ATI
    Singapore, which provides engine repair products and services
    for critical components of flight turbines, was part of a joint
    venture between General Electric Company (“GE”) and
    us. In December 2009, we completed the transfer of our ownership
    interest in the remaining ATI business (together with ATI
    Singapore, the “ATI businesses”) to GE for a nominal
    amount.

At the end of 2007, we completed the sale of our GMS businesses
    to Kongsberg Automotive Holding ASA for $560 million in
    cash. In the second quarter of 2008, we refined our estimates
    for the post-closing adjustments based on the provisions of the
    purchase agreement with Kongsberg Automotive Holdings on the
    sale of the GMS businesses. Also during 2008, we recorded a
    charge for the settlement of a contingency related to the sale
    of the GMS businesses. These activities resulted in a decrease
    in the gain on sale of the GMS businesses and are reported in
    discontinued operations as a loss of $14.2 million, net of
    taxes of $6.0 million.

On June 29, 2007, we completed the sale of a
    precision-machined components business in our Aerospace Segment
    for approximately $134 million in cash.

The Company has reported results of operations, cash flows and
    gains (losses) on the disposition of these businesses as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented. See
    Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included
    in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further information regarding divestiture activity and
    accounting for discontinued operations.

Liquidity and
    Capital Resources

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash
    to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our
    principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. In
    addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that
    affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital
    expenditures, acquisitions, pension funding, dividends, common
    stock repurchases, adequacy of available bank lines of credit,
    and access to other capital markets.

The global recessionary conditions that persisted throughout
    2009 affected the operating results of our various businesses as
    described above in “Results of Operations.”
    Nevertheless, we currently do not foresee any difficulties in
    meeting our cash requirements or accessing credit as needed in
    the next twelve months. To date, we have not experienced an
    inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers, and we
    have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to
    fund additional operating needs. However, in light of current
    economic conditions, there is an increased risk that our
    customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity. If
    current market conditions deteriorate further, we may experience
    delays in customer payments and reductions in our
    customers’ purchases from us, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our liquidity.

The precipitous deterioration in the securities markets that
    occurred during 2008 and the subsequent moderate recovery in
    these markets during 2009 has impacted the market value of the
    assets included in our defined benefit pension plans. As a
    result of these market conditions, the market value of assets in
    our domestic


pension funds declined in value by approximately
    $76 million, or 29%, during 2008 and recovered
    approximately $37 million, or 22%, in 2009. These events
    did not have a significant impact on our pension funding
    requirements in 2009, nor do we expect a significant impact on
    2010 funding requirements, because amounts funded to the plans
    in prior years exceeded the minimum amounts required in those
    years. The volatility in the securities markets has not
    significantly affected the liquidity of our pension plans or
    counterparty exposure. A majority of our domestic pension plans
    are invested in mutual funds registered with the SEC under the
    Investment Company Act of 1940. Underlying holdings of the
    mutual funds are primarily invested in publicly traded equity
    and fixed income securities.

We manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the
    funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the
    extent to which those funds can be accessed on a cost effective
    basis. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our
    subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, those
    balances are generally available without legal restrictions to
    fund ordinary business operations. We have and will continue to
    transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the U.S. and to other
    international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so.
    During 2009 we repatriated approximately $363 million of
    cash from our foreign subsidiaries and we expect to access
    approximately $70 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries
    in 2010 to help fund debt service and other cash requirements.
    Substantially all of our debt service requirements are United
    States based and we depend on foreign sources of cash to fund a
    portion of these requirements. During 2009 we repaid
    approximately $359 million of debt from the proceeds of the
    sale of businesses and from cash generated from operations. As a
    result, we have no scheduled principal payments under our senior
    credit facility until September 2011. Our next scheduled senior
    note principal payment is in July 2011 for $145 million. We
    anticipate our domestic interest payments for 2010 will be
    approximately $69 million. To the extent we cannot, or
    choose not to, repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries in time
    to meet quarterly debt service or other requirements our
    revolving credit facility can be utilized as a source of
    liquidity until such cash can be repatriated in a cost effective
    manner.

We believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and
    cash equivalents, borrowings under our revolving credit facility
    and additional sales of accounts receivable under our
    securitization program will enable us to fund our operating
    requirements, capital expenditures and debt obligations.

Cash Flow from
    Operating Activities

Lower tax payments of approximately $25 million, lower
    interest payments of approximately $25 million and
    approximately $16 million greater reduction in working
    capital were the primary contributors to the higher cash flow
    from operations in 2009 compared to 2008.

Changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in an
    aggregate decrease in cash from operations of approximately
    $101 million during 2009 which was comprised of a reduction
    in taxes of approximately $121 million offset by the impact
    from a reduction of working capital of approximately
    $20 million. The


reduction in taxes includes $97.5 million of taxes paid in
    connection with businesses divested in 2009. The reduction in
    working capital results principally from (i) lower accounts
    receivable, primarily in the Commercial and Aerospace segments
    generally, reflecting lower sales, partly offset by higher
    receivables in the Medical Segment due to a slow down in
    payments from public hospitals in Italy, Spain, Portugal and
    Greece where funding has been under pressure due to weak
    economic conditions; (ii) lower inventory due largely to
    efforts in both the Aerospace and Commercial segments in
    response to weak demand during 2009, generally, coupled with
    deliveries of cargo handling systems in the Aerospace Segment
    whose delivery schedules had been delayed from 2008 into 2009;
    partly offset by (iii) lower accounts payable and accrued
    expenses largely due to reduced spending on inventory in the
    Aerospace and Commercial segments coupled with payments of
    termination benefits and contract termination costs in
    restructuring and integration reserves.

Higher tax payments of approximately $112 million (net of
    refunds of approximately $27 million) and higher interest
    payments of approximately $60 million were the principal
    factors in the

year-on-year

decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2008
    compared to 2007. The largest factor contributing to the higher
    tax payments is approximately $90 million of taxes paid in
    connection with businesses divested in 2007.

Changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in an
    aggregate decrease in cash from operations of approximately
    $104 million during 2008 which is principally attributable
    to the $90 million of tax payments mentioned previously.
    The cash flow impact from changes in other operating assets and
    liabilities offset one another; an inventory increase of
    approximately $14 million, increase in accounts payable and
    accrued expenses of $3 million, decrease in accounts
    receivable of $11 million, and a decrease in other
    operating assets of $4 million. The ramp up in production
    of cargo handling systems to meet the delivery schedules
    communicated earlier in the year from aircraft manufacturers and
    the late in the year delay of those delivery schedules into 2009
    was the principal ($14 million) cause of the

year-on-year

increase in inventory. Nearly all of the increase in accounts
    payable and accrued expenses is due to a

year-on-year

increase in accounts payable in the Medical Segment that results
    from changes in payment patterns to suppliers of the Arrow
    operations during 2008 where early payment discounts were
    forgone in favor of longer payment terms. The $11 million
    decrease in accounts receivable reflects focused collection
    efforts in all segments and is in spite of higher sales during
    the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the same period of a year
    ago, and a heavier mix of sales in our cargo handling systems
    business to aircraft manufacturers in 2008 which carry longer
    payment terms compared to the aftermarket side of that business.
    During 2008 we repatriated approximately $104 million of
    cash from our foreign subsidiaries.

Cash Flow from
    Investing Activities

Our cash flows from investing activities from continuing
    operations in 2009 consisted primarily of proceeds from the
    sales of the ATI businesses and Power Systems operations, partly
    offset by capital expenditures of $30.4 million.

Our cash flows from investing activities from continuing
    operations in 2008 consisted primarily of capital expenditures
    of $35.2 million, deferred payments of $6.1 million
    with respect to acquired businesses, which primarily pertained
    to our acquisitions of Nordisk ($4.7 million) and Southern
    Wire ($1.0 million), and proceeds of $8.5 million from
    the sale of assets and investments, principally
    $5.3 million related to post closing adjustments in
    connection with the sale of the GMS business, $1.8 million
    derived from the sale of investments in non-consolidated
    affiliates and $1.0 million from the sale of a building
    held for sale.

Cash Flow from
    Financing Activities

Our cash flows from financing activities from continuing
    operations in 2009 consisted primarily of $357.6 million
    repayment of long-term debt and payment of dividends of
    $54.0 million, partly offset by borrowings of
    $10.0 million under our revolving credit facility.


Our cash flows from financing activities from continuing
    operations in 2008 consisted primarily of $133.9 million
    repayment of long-term debt, $92.8 million repayment of
    borrowings under our revolving credit facility and payment of
    dividends of $53.0 million, partly offset by borrowings
    under our revolving credit facility of $92.9 million.

In connection with our acquisition of Arrow, in October 2007, we
    entered into a credit agreement, which we refer to as our
    “senior credit agreement,” that provides for a
    five-year term loan facility of $1.4 billion and a
    five-year revolving line of credit facility of
    $400 million, both of which carried initial interest rates
    of LIBOR plus a spread of 150 basis points. The spread is
    subject to adjustment based upon our consolidated leverage ratio
    (generally, Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated
    EBITDA, each as defined in the senior credit agreement). At
    December 31, 2009, the spread over LIBOR was 125 basis
    points. We executed an interest rate swap for $600 million
    of the term loan from a floating 3 month LIBOR rate to a
    fixed rate of 4.75%. The notional value of the interest rate
    swap amortizes down to $350 million at maturity in 2012.
    Our obligations under the senior credit agreement are guaranteed
    by substantially all of our material wholly-owned domestic
    subsidiaries, and are secured by a pledge of the shares of
    certain of our subsidiaries.

Also in connection with our acquisition of Arrow, in October
    2007, we issued $200 million in new senior notes, which we
    refer to as the “2007 notes,” and amended certain
    terms of our outstanding notes issued in July 2004, which we
    refer to as the “2004 notes,” and October 2002, which
    we refer to as the “2002 notes.” We collectively refer
    to the 2004 notes and the 2002 notes as the “amended
    notes.” In addition, we repaid $10.5 million of
    outstanding notes issued on November 1, 1992 and
    December 15, 1993, which we collectively refer to as the
    “retired notes.” The retired notes consisted of the
    7.40% Senior Notes due November 15, 2007 and the 6.80%
    Series B Senior Notes due December 15, 2008.

The 2007 notes and the amended notes, referred to collectively
    as the “senior notes,” rank pari passu in right of
    repayment with our obligations under our senior credit agreement
    and are secured and guaranteed in the same manner as the senior
    credit agreement. The senior notes have mandatory prepayment
    requirements upon the sale of certain assets and may be
    accelerated upon certain events of default, in each case, on the
    same basis as our senior credit agreement.


The interest rates payable on the amended notes were also
    modified in connection with the foregoing transactions.
    Effective as of October 1, 2007:

•

the 2004 notes bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
    at the following rates: (i) 7.66% in respect of the

Series 2004-1

Tranche A Senior Notes due 2011; (ii) 8.14% in respect
    of the Series

2004-1

Tranche B Senior Notes due 2014; and (iii) 8.46% in
    respect of the

Series 2004-1

Tranche C Senior Notes due 2016; and

•

the 2002 notes bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
    at the rate of 7.82% per annum.

Interest rates on the amended notes are subject to reduction
    based on positive performance relative to certain financial
    ratios. During 2009, we repaid the 2002 notes and attained a
    25 basis point reduction on the 2004 notes.

Fixed rate borrowings, excluding the effect of derivative
    instruments, comprised 42% of total borrowings at
    December 31, 2009. Fixed rate borrowings, including the
    effect of derivative instruments, comprised 80% of total
    borrowings at December 31, 2009. Less than 1% of our total
    borrowings of $1,196.5 million are denominated in
    currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the Euro.

Our senior credit agreement and the senior note agreements
    contain covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict
    our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur debt,
    create liens, consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets,
    make certain investments, engage in acquisitions, pay dividends
    on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock
    and enter into swap agreements. These agreements also require us
    to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than
    3.50:1 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio (generally,
    Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense, each as
    defined in the senior credit agreement) of not less than 3.50:1
    as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal
    quarters calculated pursuant to the definitions and methodology
    set forth in the senior credit agreement. At December 31,
    2009 our consolidated leverage ratio was 2.95:1 and our interest
    coverage ratio was 4.92:1, both of which are in compliance with
    the limits mentioned in the preceding sentence.

At December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings outstanding and
    approximately $5 million in outstanding standby letters of
    credit under our $400 million revolving credit facility.
    This facility is used principally for seasonal working capital
    needs. The availability of loans under this facility is
    dependent upon our ability to maintain our financial condition
    and our continued compliance with the covenants contained in the
    senior credit agreement and senior note agreements. Moreover,
    additional borrowings would be prohibited if a Material Adverse
    Effect (as defined in the senior credit agreement) were to
    occur. Notwithstanding these restrictions, we believe that this
    revolving credit facility provides us with significant
    flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs. At
    our current level of EBITDA (as defined in the senior credit
    agreement) for the year ended December 31, 2009, we would
    have been permitted $223 million of additional debt beyond
    the levels outstanding at December 31, 2009.
    Notwithstanding the borrowing capacity described above,
    additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were
    used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of
    assets or controlling equity interests so long as the
    aforementioned leverage and interest coverage ratios are met
    after calculating EBITDA on a proforma basis to give effect to
    the acquisition.

As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all
    other terms of the senior credit agreement and the senior notes,
    and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of
    these agreements, including the leverage and interest coverage
    ratios, throughout 2010.

For additional information regarding our indebtedness, please
    see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In addition, at December 31, 2009, the Company had an
    accounts receivable securitization program under which it sells
    a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for
    consideration of up to $125 million to a commercial paper
    conduit. This facility is utilized from time to time for
    increased flexibility in funding short term working capital
    requirements. The credit market volatility during 2009 did not
    have a material impact on the


availability of the accounts receivable securitization program.
    For additional information regarding this facility, please refer
    to “Off Balance Sheet Arrangements” included in this
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.”

Stock Repurchase
    Programs

On June 14, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of
    outstanding Company common stock. Repurchases of Company stock
    under the Board authorization may be made from time to time in
    the open market and may include privately-negotiated
    transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to
    regulatory considerations. The stock repurchase program has no
    expiration date and the Company’s ability to execute on the
    program will depend on, among other factors, cash requirements
    for acquisitions, cash generation from operations, debt
    repayment obligations, market conditions and regulatory
    requirements. In addition, the Company’s senior loan
    agreements limit the aggregate amount of share repurchases and
    other restricted payments the Company may make to
    $75 million per year in the event the Company’s
    consolidated leverage ratio exceeds 3.5 to 1. Accordingly, these
    provisions may limit the Company’s ability to repurchase
    shares under this Board authorization. Through December 31,
    2009, no shares have been purchased under this Board
    authorization.

Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods
    or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that
    specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum
    quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable pricing
    provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions. These
    obligations relate primarily to material purchase requirements.

We have recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax
    positions of $109.9 million and $116.1 million as of
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.
    Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of
    ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably
    estimate the amount of any income tax payments to settle
    uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such
    payments will be made.

In 2009, cash contributions to all defined benefit pension plans
    were $9.1 million, and we estimate the amount of cash
    contributions will be in the range of $7.3 million to
    $10.0 million in 2010. Due to the potential impact of
    future plan investment performance, changes in interest rates
    and other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in
    legislation in the United States and other foreign
    jurisdictions, we are not able to


reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that
    may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods
    beyond 2010.

See Notes 14 and 15, respectively to our consolidated
    financial statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information.

Off Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

We have residual value guarantees under operating leases for
    certain equipment. The maximum potential amount of future
    payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is
    approximately $9.7 million.

We use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain
    access to credit markets with favorable interest rates and
    reduce financing costs. As currently structured, accounts
    receivable of certain domestic subsidiaries are sold on a
    non-recourse basis to a special purpose entity
    (“SPE”), which is a bankruptcy-remote consolidated
    subsidiary of Teleflex. Accordingly, the assets of the SPE are
    not available to satisfy the obligations of Teleflex or any of
    its other subsidiaries. The SPE then sells undivided interests
    in those receivables to an asset backed commercial paper
    conduit. The conduit issues notes secured by those interests and
    other assets to third party investors.

To the extent that cash consideration is received for the sale
    of undivided interests in the receivables by the SPE to the
    conduit, it is accounted for as a sale as we have relinquished
    control of the receivables. Accordingly, undivided interests in
    accounts receivable sold to the commercial paper conduit under
    these transactions are excluded from accounts receivable, net in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The interests for
    which cash consideration is not received from the conduit are
    retained by the SPE and remain in accounts receivable, net in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. However, as noted
    below, the accounting for accounts receivables sold will change
    beginning in the first quarter of 2010.

The interests in receivables sold and the interest in
    receivables retained by the SPE are carried at face value, which
    is due to the short-term nature of our accounts receivable. The
    SPE has received cash consideration of $39.7 million and
    $39.7 million for the interests in the accounts receivable
    it has sold to the commercial paper conduit at December 31,
    2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. No gain or loss
    is recorded upon sale as fee charges from the commercial paper
    conduit are based upon a floating yield rate and the period the
    undivided interests remain outstanding. Fee charges from the
    commercial paper conduit are accrued at the end of each month.
    If we default under the accounts receivable securitization
    program, the commercial paper conduit is entitled to receive
    collections on receivables owned by the SPE in satisfaction of
    the amount of cash consideration paid to the SPE by the
    commercial paper conduit.

Information regarding the outstanding balances related to the
    SPE’s interests in accounts receivables sold or retained as
    of December 31, 2009 is as follows:

Other fee charges related to the sale of receivables to the
    commercial paper conduit for the year ended December 31,
    2009 were not material.

We continue to service the receivables after they are sold to
    the conduit pursuant to servicing agreements with the SPE. No
    servicing asset is recorded at the time of sale because we do
    not receive any servicing fees from third parties or other
    income related to the servicing of the receivables. We do not
    record any servicing liability at the time of the sale as the
    receivables collection period is relatively short and the costs
    of servicing the receivables sold over the servicing period are
    insignificant. Servicing costs are recognized as incurred over
    the servicing period.

In the first quarter of 2010, we will adopt an amendment to
    Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) topic 860,
    “Transfers and Servicing” that affects the accounting
    for transfers of financial assets. Outstanding accounts
    receivable that we previously treated as sold and removed from
    the balance sheet will be included in accounts receivable, net
    on our balance sheet and the amounts outstanding under our
    accounts receivable securitization program will be accounted for
    as a secured borrowing and reflected as short-term debt on our
    balance sheet (which as of December 31, 2009 is
    $39.7 million for both). In addition, while there has been
    no change in the arrangement under our securitization program,
    the adoption of this amendment will reduce cash flow from
    operations by approximately $39.7 million and result in a
    corresponding increase in cash flow from financing activities.

See also Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
    at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

We have identified the following as critical accounting
    estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of
    significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive
    and important to the presentation of our financial condition and
    results of operations and could potentially result in materially
    different results under different assumptions and conditions.

Accounting for
    Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

In the ordinary course of business, we grant non-interest
    bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms. In
    an effort to reduce our credit risk, we (i) establish
    credit limits for all of our customer relationships,
    (ii) perform ongoing credit evaluations of our
    customers’ financial condition, (iii) monitor the
    payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables,
    and (iv) monitor open orders against an individual
    customer’s outstanding receivable balance.


An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts
    receivable based on our historical collection experience and
    expected collectability of the accounts receivable, considering
    the period an account is outstanding, the financial position of
    the customer and information provided by credit rating services.
    The adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period
    and adjusted as necessary. Our allowance for doubtful accounts
    was $7.1 million at December 31, 2009 and
    $8.7 million at December 31, 2008 which was 2.6% of
    gross accounts receivable at those respective dates. In light of
    the disruptions in global credit markets that occurred in the
    fourth quarter of 2008 and continued through 2009 we have taken
    this heightened risk of customer payment default into account
    when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts at
    December 31, 2009 by engaging in a more robust

customer-by-customer

risk assessment. Although future results cannot always be
    predicted by extrapolating past results, management believes
    that it is reasonably likely that future results will be
    consistent with historical trends and experience. However, if
    the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to
    deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make
    payments, or if unexpected events or significant future changes
    in trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required.

Inventory
    Utilization

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
    Accordingly, we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete
    inventory to reduce the carrying value of our inventories for
    the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence,
    damage or other issues affecting marketability equal to the
    difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated
    market value. Factors utilized in the determination of estimated
    market value include (i) current sales data and historical
    return rates, (ii) estimates of future demand,
    (iii) competitive pricing pressures, (iv) new product
    introductions, (v) product expiration dates, and
    (vi) component and packaging obsolescence.

The adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period
    and adjusted as necessary. We regularly compare inventory
    quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related
    to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and
    excessive quantities. In assessing historical usage, we also
    qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the
    reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of
    future usage.

Our excess and obsolete inventory reserve was $35.3 million
    at December 31, 2009 and $37.5 million at
    December 31, 2008 which was 8.9% and 8.1% of gross
    inventories, at those respective dates.

Accounting for
    Long-Lived Assets and Investments

The ability to realize long-lived assets is evaluated
    periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible
    inability to recover their carrying amount. Such evaluation is
    based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow
    projections. The analyses necessarily involve significant
    management judgment. Any impairment loss, if indicated, is
    measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
    exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.

Accounting for
    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Acquired intangible assets may represent indefinite-lived assets
    (e.g., certain trademarks or brands), determinable-lived
    intangibles (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer
    relationships, patents and technologies) or residual goodwill.
    Of these, only the costs of determinable-lived intangibles are
    amortized to expense over their estimated life. The value of the
    indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not
    amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our
    impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our
    impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. Goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangibles assets, primarily trademarks and
    brand names, are tested annually for impairment during the
    fourth quarter, using the first day of the quarter as the
    measurement date, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain
    events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the
    carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions may
    include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change
    in the assessment of future operations.

Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the
    impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate
    future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in the
    Company’s impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth
    rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal
    projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and
    estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by
    other marketplace participants.

Goodwill

Impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level.
    For purposes of this assessment, the Company’s reporting
    units are generally its businesses one level below the
    respective operating segment.

Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The
    first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a
    reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. In
    performing the first step, the Company calculated fair values of
    the various reporting units using equal weighting of two
    methods; one which estimates the discounted cash flows
    (“DCF”) of each of the reporting units based on
    projected earnings in the future (the Income Approach) and one
    which is based on sales of similar assets in actual transactions
    (the Market Approach). If the fair value exceeds the carrying
    value, there is no impairment. If the reporting unit carrying
    amount exceeds the fair value, the second step of the goodwill
    impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the
    impairment loss, if any.

Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant
    judgment. The more significant judgments and assumptions made to
    determine the fair value of our reporting units were
    (1) the amount and timing of expected future cash flows
    which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales,
    operating income, industry trends and the regulatory environment
    of the individual reporting units, (2) the expected
    long-term growth rates for each of our reporting units which
    approximate the expected long-term growth rate of the global
    economy and of the respective industries in which the reporting
    units operate, (3) discount rates that are used to discount
    future cash flows to their present values which are based on an
    assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the
    respective reporting units along with various market based
    inputs, (4) relevant comparable company selection, and
    (5) calculation of comparable company multiples. There were
    no changes to the underlying methods used in the current year as
    compared to the prior year valuations of our reporting units.
    The DCF analysis utilized in the fourth quarter 2009 impairment
    test was performed over a ten year time horizon for each
    reporting unit where the compound growth rates during this
    period range from approximately 4% to 8% for revenue and from
    approximately 4% to 12% for operating income. Discount rates
    were 10.5% for reporting units in the Medical Segment and 13.5%
    for reporting units in the Aerospace and Commercial segments. A
    perpetual growth rate of 2.5% was assumed for all reporting
    units.

In arriving at our estimate of the fair value of each reporting
    unit, we considered the results of both the DCF and the market
    comparable methods and concluded the fair value to be the
    average of the results yielded by the two methods for each
    reporting unit. Then, the current market capitalization of the
    Company was reconciled to the sum of the estimated fair values
    of the individual reporting units, plus a control premium, to
    ensure the fair value conclusions were reasonable in light of
    current market capitalization. The control premium implied by
    our


analysis was approximately 34%, which was deemed to be within a
    reasonable range of observed average industry control premiums.

No impairment in the carrying value of any of our reporting
    units was evident as a result of the assessment of their
    respective fair values as determined under the methodology
    described above. The fair values of our reporting units whose
    assets include goodwill, other than the North America reporting
    unit within the Medical segment, exceed their respective
    carrying values by 51% to 150%. For the Medical —
    North America reporting unit, the fair value is approximately
    18% higher than its carrying value and at approximately
    $960 million the goodwill attributed to the
    Medical — North America reporting unit is
    approximately 66% of our total goodwill.

Our expected future growth rates are based on our estimates of
    future sales, operating income and cash flow and are consistent
    with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a
    modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful
    launch of new products each year which, together, more than
    offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach
    the end of their life cycle. As a result of this analysis, the
    compound annual growth rate of sales and cash flows over the
    projected ten year period in the Medical — North
    America reporting unit is estimated to be 4.8% and 4.9%,
    respectively. Under the income approach, significant changes in
    assumptions would be required for this reporting unit to fail
    the step one test. For example, an increase of over

one-and-a-quarter

percent in the discount rate or a decrease of over 30% percent
    in the compound annual growth rate of operating income would be
    required.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical
    substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition
    apart from goodwill. Intangible assets obtained through
    acquisitions are comprised mainly of technology, customer
    relationships, and trade names. The fair value of acquired
    technology and trade names is estimated by the use of a relief
    from royalty method, which values an intangible asset by
    estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an
    asset. Under this method, an owner of an intangible asset
    determines the arms length royalty that likely would have been
    charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third
    party. The royalty, which is based on a reasonable rate applied
    against forecasted sales, is tax-effected and discounted to
    present value using a discount rate commensurate with the
    relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the
    asset. The fair value of acquired customer relationships is
    estimated by the use of an income approach known as the excess
    earnings method. The excess earnings method measures economic
    benefit indirectly by calculating residual profit attributable
    to an asset after appropriate returns are paid to complementary
    or contributory assets. The residual profit is tax-effected and
    discounted to present value at an appropriate discount rate that
    reflects the risk factors associated with the estimated income
    stream. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset
    requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will
    have different useful lives and certain assets may even be
    considered to have indefinite useful lives.

Management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets on at least
    an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary. In connection
    with the analysis, management tests for impairment by comparing
    the carrying value of intangible assets to their estimated fair
    values. Since quoted market prices are seldom available for
    intangible assets, we utilize present value techniques to
    estimate fair value. Common among such approaches is the relief
    from royalty methodology described above, under which management
    estimates the direct cash flows associated with the intangible
    asset. Management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate,
    discount rate, and residual growth rate to estimate the
    forecasted cash flows associated with the asset.

Discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the
    impairment test of indefinite-lived assets during the fourth
    quarter of 2009 are comparable to the rates utilized in the
    impairment test of goodwill by segment. Compound annual growth
    rates in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade
    names in the Medical Segment ranged from 3.7% to 10.2% and a
    royalty rate of 4.0% was assumed. The compound annual growth
    rate in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade
    names in the Commercial Segment was 2.0% and a royalty rate of
    2.0% was assumed. Discount rate assumptions are based on an
    assessment of the risk inherent


in the future cash flows generated as a result of the respective
    intangible assets. Assumptions about royalty rates are based on
    the rates at which similar trademarks or technologies are being
    licensed in the marketplace.

No impairment in the carrying value of any of our trade names
    was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective
    fair values as determined under the methodology described above,
    nor would impairment be evident had the fair value of each
    Company’s indefinite-lived assets been hypothetically lower
    than presently estimated by 10% as of September 28, 2009.

We are not required to perform an annual impairment test for
    long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets
    (e.g., customer relationships); instead, long-lived assets are
    tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event.
    Triggering events include the likely (i.e., more likely than
    not) disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of
    an adverse change in the market involving the business employing
    the related assets. Significant judgments in this area involve
    determining whether a triggering event has occurred and
    re-assessing the reasonableness of the remaining useful lives of
    finite-lived assets by, among other things, validating customer
    attrition rates.

Acquired
    In-Process Research and Development

In connection with the acquisition of Arrow International, the
    Company recorded a $30 million charge to operations during
    2007 for in-process research and development
    (“IPR&D”) assets acquired that the Company
    determined had no alternative future use in their current state.
    This amount represents the estimated value based on
    risk-adjusted cash flows related to in-process projects that had
    not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative
    future uses as of the date of the acquisition. The primary basis
    for determining the technological feasibility of these projects
    is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying
    products.

The value assigned to the acquired in-process technology was
    determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired
    technology into commercially viable products, estimating the
    resulting net cash flows from the projects, and discounting the
    net cash flows to their present value. The revenue projections
    used to value the acquired in-process research and development
    were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth
    factors, expected trends in technology, and the nature and
    expected timing of new product introductions by us and our
    competitors. The resulting net cash flows from such projects
    were based on our estimates of cost of sales, operating
    expenses, and income taxes from such projects.

The rate of 14 percent utilized to discount the net cash
    flows to their present value was based on estimated cost of
    capital calculations and the implied rate of return from the
    Company’s acquisition model plus a risk premium. Due to the
    nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the
    developmental projects, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates
    were used for the in-process research and development projects.
    The discount rates are based on the stage of completion and
    uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the
    purchased in-process technology projects.

The purchased in-process technology of Arrow relates to research
    and development projects in the Central Venus Access Catheters,
    Peripherally Inserted Catheters and Specialty Care Catheters
    product families.

Accounting for
    Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

We provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired
    employees, including pensions and postretirement healthcare.
    Several statistical and other factors which are designed to
    project future events are used in calculating the expense and
    liability related to these plans. These factors include
    actuarial assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of
    return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates
    and healthcare cost trend rates. We review the actuarial
    assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the
    assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.


The weighted average assumptions for U.S. and foreign plans
    used in determining net benefit cost were as follows:

Product Warranty
    Liability

We warrant to the original purchaser of certain of our products
    that we will, at our option, repair or replace, without charge,
    such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect.
    Warranty periods vary by product. We have recourse provisions
    for certain products that would enable recovery from third
    parties for amounts paid under the warranty. We accrue for
    product warranties when, based on available information, it is
    probable that customers will make claims under warranties
    relating to products that have been sold, and a reasonable
    estimate of the costs (based on historical claims experience
    relative to sales) can be made. Our estimated product warranty
    liability was $12.1 million and $17.1 million at
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.

Share-based
    Compensation

We estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of
    grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of
    the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as
    expense over the requisite service periods. Share-based
    compensation expense is measured using a multiple point
    Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account
    highly subjective and complex assumptions. The expected life of
    options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award,
    as well as historical exercise behavior, and represents the
    period of time that options granted are expected to be
    outstanding. Expected volatilities are based on a blend of
    historical volatility and implied volatility derived from
    publicly traded options to purchase our common stock, which we
    believe is more reflective of the market conditions and a better
    indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical
    volatility. The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield
    currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues
    with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option.

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

Our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the
    deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess
    uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize
    estimates. We conduct a broad range of operations around the
    world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous


international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax
    audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which
    is uncertain. Management must make judgments about such
    uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and
    liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
    and recorded using current enacted tax rates, which the Company
    expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those
    temporary differences are recovered or settled. The likelihood
    of a material change in the Company’s expected realization
    of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, its
    ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks,
    final U.S. and foreign tax settlements, and the
    effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various
    relevant jurisdictions. While management believes that its
    judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are
    appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may
    require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities and
    such adjustments could be material.

We are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred
    tax assets. We evaluate all positive and negative evidence and
    use judgments regarding past and future events, including
    operating results and available tax planning strategies that
    could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets to help
    determine when it is more likely than not that all or some
    portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized. Based on
    this assessment, we evaluate the need for, and amount of,
    valuation allowances to offset future tax benefits that may not
    be realized. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the
    future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of
    $49.2 million and $57.9 million at December 31,
    2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, relates
    principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain
    deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards
    in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate
    sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits
    related to the remaining net deferred tax asset. The valuation
    allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions under
    ASC topic 740 “Income Taxes,” which requires that a
    valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is
    “more likely than not” that all or a portion of
    deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation
    allowance decrease in 2009 was primarily attributable to the
    sale of entities associated with Power Systems operations,
    utilization of certain foreign net operating losses and movement
    in unrealized gain/loss in relation to pension valuation.

Significant judgment is required in determining income tax
    provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish
    additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief
    that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain
    positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, as
    defined under the Income Taxes topic, which is a tax position
    that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by
    the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of
    business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by
    various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities. We regularly
    assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any
    future examinations for the current or prior years in
    determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We
    continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential
    adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax
    liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts
    that give rise to a revision become known. Specifically, we are
    currently in the midst of examinations by the U.S. and
    German taxing authorities with respect to our income tax returns
    for those countries for various tax years. The ultimate outcomes
    of the examinations of these returns could result in increases
    or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities, which could impact
    our financial results.

    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information regarding the Company’s
    uncertain tax positions.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market
    Risk

We are exposed to certain financial risks, specifically
    fluctuations in market interest rates, foreign currency exchange
    rates and, to a lesser extent, commodity prices. We use
    derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact
    of some of these risks. All instruments are entered into for
    other than trading purposes. We are also exposed to changes in
    the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the
    valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings.

Interest Rate
    Risk

We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our
    borrowing activities and our cash balances. An interest rate
    swap is used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk. The
    table below is an analysis of the amortization and related
    interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable
    rate debt obligations. Variable interest rates shown below are
    weighted average rates of the debt portfolio based on
    December 31, 2009 rates. For the swap, the notional amount
    and the related interest rate is shown by year of maturity. The
    fair value, net of tax, of the interest rate swap as of
    December 31, 2009 was a loss of $17.6 million
    reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.

The notional value of the interest rate swap was
    $600 million at inception and amortizes down to a notional
    value of $350 million at maturity in 2012. As of
    December 31, 2009, the notional value of the interest rate
    swap was $450 million.

(2)

The all in cost of the $450 million swapped debt is 4.75%
    plus the applicable spread over LIBOR, which at
    December 31, 2009 was 125 basis points.

A 1.0% change in variable interest rates would adversely or
    positively impact our expected net earnings by approximately
    $1.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Foreign Currency
    Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in market values of transactions
    in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain
    subsidiaries. We have entered into forward contracts with
    several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of
    projected cash flows from these exposures. These are primarily
    contracts to buy or sell a foreign currency against the
    U.S. dollar. The fair value of the open forward contracts
    as of December 31, 2009 was a gain of $0.3 million.
    The following table presents our open forward currency contracts
    as of December 31, 2009, which mature in 2010. Forward
    contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the
    stated currencies (in thousands). The total notional amount for
    all contracts translates to approximately $74.8 million.

A strengthening of 10% in the value of the U.S. dollar
    against foreign currencies would, on a combined basis, adversely
    impact the translation of our non-US subsidiary net earnings and
    transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of
    certain subsidiaries by approximately $9.5 million, for the
    year ended December 31, 2010.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
    of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
    period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
    that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
    period covered by this report are functioning effectively to
    provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be
    disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to
    our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute
    assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system
    are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
    any, within a company have been detected.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Teleflex Incorporated and its subsidiaries
    (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
    Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
    expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
    and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
    the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
    the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, management
    used the framework established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). As a result of this assessment and based on the criteria
    in the COSO framework, management has concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2009, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears
    herein.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Teleflex
    Incorporated:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index appearing on page F-1 present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Teleflex
    Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In
    addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
    listed in the accompanying index appearing on page F-1 presents
    fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
    therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
    financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting, appearing on

page F-2.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

    millions, except per share)

Note 1 —
    Summary of significant accounting policies

Consolidation:

The consolidated financial
    statements include the accounts of Teleflex Incorporated and its
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) and variable interest
    entities in which the Company bears a majority of the risk of
    the potential losses or gains from a majority of the expected
    returns. Intercompany transactions are eliminated in
    consolidation. Investments in affiliates over which the Company
    has significant influence but not a controlling equity interest
    are carried on the equity basis. Investments in affiliates over
    which the Company does not have significant influence are
    accounted for by the cost method of accounting. These
    consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America and include management’s estimates
    and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents:

All highly liquid
    debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or
    less are classified as cash equivalents. The carrying value of
    cash equivalents approximates their current market value.

Accounts receivable:

Accounts receivable
    represents amounts due from customers related to the sale of
    products and provision of services. An allowance for doubtful
    accounts is maintained and represents the Company’s
    estimate of probable losses on realization of the full
    receivable. The allowance is provided at such time that
    management believes reasonable doubt exists that such balances
    will be collected within a reasonable period of time. The
    allowance is based on the Company’s historical experience,
    the length of time an account is outstanding, the financial
    position of the customer and information provided by credit
    rating services. The allowance for doubtful accounts was
    $7.1 million and $8.7 million as of December 31,
    2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at the
    lower of cost or market. The cost of the Company’s
    inventories is determined by the

“first-in,

first-out” method for catheter and related product
    inventories and by the average cost method for other inventory
    categories. Elements of cost in inventory include raw materials,
    direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. In estimating market
    value, the Company evaluates inventory for excess and obsolete
    quantities based on estimated usage and sales.

Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant
    and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated
    depreciation. Costs incurred to develop internal-use computer
    software during the application development stage generally are
    capitalized. Costs of enhancements to internal-use computer
    software are capitalized, provided that these enhancements
    result in additional functionality. Other additions and those
    improvements which increase the capacity or lengthen the useful
    lives of the assets are also capitalized. With minor exceptions,
    straight-line composite lives for depreciation of property,
    plant and equipment are as follows: land
    improvements — 5 years; buildings —
    30 years

;

machinery and equipment — 3 to
    10 years; computer equipment and software — 3 to
    5 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the
    remaining lease periods. Repairs and maintenance costs are
    expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and other intangible assets:

Goodwill
    and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not
    amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually,
    during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events

F-8

TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not
    be recoverable. Impairment losses, if any, are recorded as part
    of income from operations. The goodwill impairment test is
    applied to each of the Company’s reporting units. For
    purposes of this assessment, a reporting unit is the operating
    segment, or a business one level below that operating segment
    (the component level) if discrete financial information is
    prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. However,
    components are aggregated as a single reporting unit if they
    have similar economic characteristics. The goodwill impairment
    test is applied using a two-step approach. In performing the
    first step, the Company calculates fair values of the various
    reporting units using equal weighting of two methods; one which
    estimates the discounted cash flows (“DCF”) of each of
    the reporting units based on projected earnings in the future
    (the Income Approach) and one which is based on sales of similar
    assets in actual transactions (the Market Approach). If the
    reporting unit carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the
    second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to
    measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. In the second
    step, the implied fair value of the goodwill is estimated as the
    fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step less the
    fair values of all net tangible and intangible assets of the
    reporting unit other than goodwill. If the carrying amount of
    the goodwill exceeds its implied fair market value, an
    impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess,
    not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill. For other
    indefinite lived intangible assets, the impairment test consists
    of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets to
    their carrying amounts.

Intangible assets consisting of intellectual property, customer
    lists and distribution rights are being amortized over their
    estimated useful lives, which are as follows: intellectual
    property, 3 to 20 years; customer lists, 5 to
    30 years; distribution rights, 3 to 22 years. The
    weighted average amortization period is approximately
    15 years. Trade names of $326.8 million are considered
    indefinite lived. The Company periodically evaluates the
    reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets. During 2007,
    the Company terminated certain contractual relationships that
    resulted in an impairment charge of $2.5 million which is
    included in restructuring and other impairment charges.

Long-lived assets:

The ability to realize
    long-lived assets is evaluated when events or circumstances
    indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount.
    Such evaluation is based on various analyses, including
    undiscounted cash flow and profitability projections that
    incorporate, as applicable, the impact on the existing business.
    The analyses necessarily involve significant management
    judgment. Any impairment loss, if indicated, is measured as the
    amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
    estimated fair value of the asset.

Product warranty liability:

The Company
    warrants to the original purchaser of certain of its products
    that it will, at its option, repair or replace, without charge,
    such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect.
    Warranty periods vary by product. The Company has recourse
    provisions for certain products that would enable recovery from
    third parties for amounts paid under the warranty. The Company
    accrues for product warranties when, based on available
    information, it is probable that customers will make claims
    under warranties relating to products that have been sold, and a
    reasonable estimate of the costs (based on historical claims
    experience relative to sales) can be made.

Foreign currency translation:

Assets and
    liabilities of non-domestic subsidiaries denominated in local
    currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of
    exchange at the balance sheet date; income and expenses are
    translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during
    the year. The resultant translation adjustments are reported as
    a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in equity.

Derivative financial instruments:

The Company
    uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of
    hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. All instruments are entered into for
    other than trading purposes. All derivatives are recognized on
    the balance sheet at fair value.

F-9

TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in
    earnings or other comprehensive income, based on whether the
    instrument is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if
    so, the type of hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative
    instruments reported in other comprehensive income are
    reclassified to earnings in the period in which earnings are
    affected by the underlying hedged item. The ineffective portion
    of all hedges is recognized in current period earnings. If the
    hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes
    probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur,
    gains or losses on the derivative are recorded in current period
    earnings.

Share-based compensation:

The Company
    estimates the fair value of share-based awards on the date of
    grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of
    the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as
    expense over the requisite service periods. Share-based
    compensation expense is measured using a multiple point
    Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account
    highly subjective and complex assumptions. The expected life of
    options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award,
    as well as historical exercise behavior, and represents the
    period of time that options granted are expected to be
    outstanding. Expected volatilities are based on a blend of
    historical volatility and implied volatility derived from
    publicly traded options to purchase the Company’s common
    stock, which the Company believes is more reflective of the
    market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility
    than solely using historical volatility. The risk-free interest
    rate is the implied yield currently available on
    U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term
    equal to the expected life of the option.

Share-based compensation expense for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
    $9.1 million, $8.5 million and $7.4 million,
    respectively and is included in selling, engineering and
    administrative expenses. The total income tax benefit recognized
    for share-based compensation arrangements for 2009, 2008 and
    2007 was $2.5 million, $2.1 million and
    $1.5 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, unamortized share-based
    compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, net of
    expected forfeitures, was $4.6 million, which is expected
    to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    1.77 years. Unamortized share-based compensation cost
    related to non-vested shares (restricted stock), net of expected
    forfeitures, was $7.0 million, which is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.78 years.

Share-based compensation expense recognized during a period is
    based on the value of the portion of stock-based awards that is
    ultimately expected to vest during the period less estimated
    forfeitures. Share-based compensation expense recognized in
    2009, 2008 and 2007 included compensation expense for
    (1) share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested
    as of December 25, 2005, based on the fair value on the
    grant date estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions
    of ASC topic 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation,”
    and (2) share-based awards granted subsequent to
    December 25, 2005, based on the fair value on the grant
    date estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    Compensation-Stock Compensation. The topic requires forfeitures
    to be estimated at the time of grant. Management reviews and
    revises the estimate of forfeitures for all share-based awards
    on a quarterly basis based on management’s expectation of
    the awards that will ultimately vest to minimize fluctuations in
    share-based compensation expense. In 2009, the Company issued
    175,684 non-vested shares (restricted stock) the majority of
    which vest in three years (cliff vesting).

Income taxes:

The provision for income taxes
    is determined using the asset and liability approach of
    accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes
    represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or
    paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes
    paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred
    taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences
    between the financial and tax bases of the Company’s assets
    and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and
    tax laws when changes are enacted. Provision

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

has been made for income taxes on unremitted earnings of
    subsidiaries and affiliates, except for subsidiaries in which
    earnings are deemed to be permanently re-invested.

Significant judgment is required in determining income tax
    provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish
    additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief
    that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain
    positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold
    which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be
    sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority.
    In the normal course of business, the Company and its
    subsidiaries are examined by various Federal, State and foreign
    tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of
    these examinations and any future examinations for the current
    or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for
    income taxes. Interest accrued related to unrecognized tax
    benefits and income tax related penalties are both included in
    taxes on income from continuing operations. We periodically
    assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and
    adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and
    deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise
    to a revision become known.

Pensions and other postretirement
    benefits:

The Company provides a range of
    benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including
    pensions and postretirement healthcare. The Company records
    annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations
    which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount
    rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, compensation
    increases, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. The
    Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and
    makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates
    and trends when appropriate. As required, the effect of the
    modifications is generally amortized over future periods.

Restructuring costs:

Restructuring costs,
    which include termination benefits, facility closure costs,
    contract termination costs and other restructuring costs are
    recorded at estimated fair value. Key assumptions in calculating
    the restructuring costs include the terms that may be negotiated
    to exit certain contractual obligations and the timing of
    employees leaving the company.

Revenue recognition:

The Company recognizes
    revenues from product sales, including sales to distributors, or
    services provided when the following revenue recognition
    criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the
    selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is
    reasonably assured. This generally occurs when products are
    shipped, when services are rendered or upon customers’
    acceptance.

Revenues from product sales, net of estimated returns and other
    allowances based on historical experience and current trends,
    are recognized upon shipment of products to customers or
    distributors. Net revenues from services provided are recognized
    as the services are rendered and comprised 0.7%, 0.6% and 4.1%
    of net revenues in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Company’s normal policy is to accept returns only in
    cases in which the product is defective and covered under the
    Company’s standard warranty provisions. However, in the
    limited cases where an arrangement provides a right of return to
    the customer, including a distributor, the Company believes it
    has the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of returns
    based on its substantial historical experience with respect to
    these arrangements. The Company accrues any costs or losses that
    may be expected in connection with any returns in accordance
    with ASC topic 450, “Contingencies.” Revenues and
    materials, labor and other product costs are reduced to reflect
    estimated returns.

Allowances for discounts and rebates related to customer
    incentive programs, which include discounts or rebates, are
    estimated and provided for in the period that the related sales
    are recorded. These allowances are recorded as a reduction of
    revenue.

Subsequent Events:

We have evaluated the
    period from December 31, 2009, the date of the financial
    statements, through February 24, 2010, the date of the
    issuance and filing of the financial statements, and determined
    that no material subsequent events occurred that would affect
    the information presented in these financial statements or
    require additional disclosure other than as presented in
    Note 19.

Reclassifications:

Certain reclassifications
    have been made to the prior years’ consolidated financial
    statements to conform to current year presentation. Certain
    financial information is presented on a rounded basis, which may
    cause minor differences.

Note 2 —
    New accounting standards

The financial statements included in this report reflect changes
    resulting from the recent adoption of several accounting
    pronouncements. The subject matter of the changes, and the
    footnotes in which they appear, are as follows:

Evaluation period of subsequent events in Note 1;

Disclosure of derivative instruments and hedging activities in
    Note 10;

Fair value of long-term debt in Note 9; and

Fair value measurements in Note 11.

Described below are several accounting pronouncements that we
    either recently adopted (including those reflected in the
    footnotes referenced above) or will adopt in the near future:

The Company adopted the following new accounting standards as of
    January 1, 2009, the first day of its 2009 fiscal year:

Fair Value Measurements:

In September 2006,
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    established a framework for measuring fair value, and expanded
    disclosure about such fair value measurements.

In February 2008, the FASB allowed a deferral of the effective
    date of this framework for all nonfinancial assets and
    nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or
    disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
    recurring basis (at least annually). The Company adopted the
    initial framework as of January 1, 2008 with respect to
    financial assets and financial liabilities and adopted the
    entire framework as of January 1, 2009 with respect to
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities. While the topic and the
    related update did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial
    position upon adoption, the framework required additional
    disclosures regarding the Company’s assets and liabilities
    recorded at fair value which are included in Note 11.

Business Combinations:

In December 2007, the
    FASB revised the accounting for business combinations which
    retained the fundamental requirement that the acquisition method
    of accounting (previously referred to as the

purchase
    method

) be used for all business combinations and that an
    acquirer be identified for each business combination. The
    revision defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control
    of one or more businesses in the business combination and
    establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer
    achieves control.

The revision replaces the cost-allocation process and requires
    an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities
    assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquired
    business at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values
    as of that date, with limited exceptions. In addition, the
    revision changes the allocation and treatment of
    acquisition-related costs, restructuring costs that the acquirer
    expected but was not

F-12

TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

obligated to incur, the recognition of assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed arising from contingencies and the
    recognition and measurement of goodwill.

The FASB, on April 1, 2009, clarified issues that arose
    regarding initial recognition and measurement, subsequent
    measurement and accounting and disclosure of assets and
    liabilities arising from contingencies in a business
    combination. The clarification did not have an impact on the
    Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial
    position upon their adoption.

Non-controlling Interests:

In December 2007,
    the FASB established accounting and reporting standards for the
    non-controlling interest in a subsidiary, sometimes referred to
    as minority interest, and for the deconsolidation of a
    subsidiary. These standards clarified that a non-controlling
    interest in a subsidiary held by a party other than the parent
    is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should
    be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements.
    A non-controlling interest in subsidiaries held by parties other
    than the parent is to be clearly identified, labeled, and
    presented in the consolidated statement of financial position
    within equity, but separate from the parent’s equity, that
    the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent
    and to the non-controlling interest be clearly identified and
    presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income,
    that the changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the
    parent retains its controlling financial interest in its
    subsidiary be accounted for consistently as equity transactions
    and that when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained
    non-controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary be
    initially measured at fair value. This changed the presentation
    of non-controlling interests on our income statement, balance
    sheet and changes in equity.

Disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging
    activities:

In March 2008, the FASB enhanced
    disclosures about (a) how and why a company uses derivative
    instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items are accounted for under the topic and related
    interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and
    related hedged items affect the Company’s financial
    position, financial performance, and cash flows. Refer to
    Note 10 for the enhanced disclosures related to the
    Company’s derivative instruments.

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets:

In April 2008, the FASB issued guidance
    that addresses the factors that should be considered in
    developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine
    the useful lives for intangible assets. The guidance requires an
    entity to consider its own historical experience in renewing or
    extending similar arrangements, regardless of whether those
    arrangements have explicit renewal or extension provisions, when
    determining the useful life of an intangible asset. In the
    absence of such experience, an entity shall consider the
    assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or
    extension, adjusted for entity-specific factors. The guidance
    did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of
    operations, cash flows or financial position upon adoption.

The Company adopted the following new accounting standards in
    the second quarter of 2009:

Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments:

In April 2009, the FASB guidance
    which required disclosures about fair value of financial
    instruments for interim reporting periods as well as in annual
    financial statements. The guidance required those disclosures in
    summarized financial information at interim reporting periods.
    The guidance which requires that an entity disclose in the body
    or in the accompanying notes of its financial information the
    fair value of all financial instruments for which it is
    practicable to estimate that value, whether recognized or not
    recognized in the statement of financial position. In addition,
    an entity shall also disclose the method(s) and significant
    assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial
    instruments.

The guidance does not require disclosures for earlier periods
    presented for comparative purposes at initial adoption. Refer to
    Note 11 for fair value disclosures related to the
    Company’s financial instruments.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity
    for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and
    Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly:

In
    April 2009, the FASB provided additional guidance for estimating
    fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset
    or liability have significantly decreased. The guidance also
    identifies circumstances that indicate a transaction is not
    orderly.

The guidance does not require disclosures for earlier periods
    presented for comparative purposes at initial adoption. The
    adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial
    position.

Subsequent Events:

In May 2009, the FASB
    established reporting and disclosure requirements based on the
    existence of conditions at the date of the balance sheet for
    events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet
    date but before the financial statements are issued or are
    available to be issued. Companies are required to disclose the
    date through which subsequent events have been evaluated and
    whether that date is the date the financial statements were
    issued or were available to be issued.

The Company adopted the following new accounting standard in the
    third quarter of 2009:

The FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification

TM

and

    the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles:

In June 2009, the FASB identified the
    sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting
    the principles used in the preparation of financial statements
    of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity
    with GAAP in the United States (the GAAP hierarchy). The FASB
    established its Accounting Standards Codification (the
    “Codification”) as the source of authoritative GAAP
    recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental
    entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under
    federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP
    for SEC registrants. All guidance contained in the Codification
    carries an equal level of authority.

The Company adopted the following new accounting standards in
    the fourth quarter of 2009:

Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan
    Assets:

In December 2008, the FASB provided
    guidance requiring additional disclosures about the investment
    policies and strategies for the major categories of plan assets,
    and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. Refer
    to Note 15 for the new disclosures related to the
    Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans.

Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value:

In
    September 2009, the FASB clarified how an entity should measure
    the fair value of liabilities and that restrictions which
    prevent the transfer of a liability should not be considered as
    separate inputs or adjustments in the measurement of the
    liability’s fair value. The guidance reaffirms the
    measurements concept of determining fair value based on an
    orderly transaction between market participants even though
    liabilities are infrequently transferred due to contractual or
    other legal restrictions. The guidance did not have an impact on
    the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or
    financial position upon its adoption.

The Company will adopt the following amendments to accounting
    standards as of January 1, 2010, the first day of its 2010
    fiscal year:

Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets — an
    amendment to Transfers and Servicing:

In June
    2009, the FASB issued guidance to improve the information that
    is reported in financial statements about the transfer of
    financial assets and the effects of transfers of financial
    assets on financial position, financial performance and cash
    flows and a transferor’s continuing involvement, if any,
    with transferred financial assets. In addition, the guidance
    eliminates the concept of qualifying special purpose entities
    and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset or a
    portion of a financial asset should be derecognized in the
    financial statements being presented when the transferor has not
    transferred the entire original financial asset to an entity
    that is not

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

consolidated with the transferor

and/or

when
    the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred
    financial asset. Upon the adoption of this guidance in the first
    quarter of 2010 the accounts receivable that the Company had
    previously treated as sold and removed from the balance sheet
    will be included in accounts receivable, net and the amounts
    outstanding under the Company’s Accounts Receivable
    Securitization Program will be accounted for as a secured
    borrowing and reflected as short-term debt on our balance sheet
    (which as of December 31, 2009 is $39.7 million for
    both). In addition, while there has been no change in the
    arrangement under the Company’s securitization program, the
    adoption of this amendment reduce cash flow from operations by
    approximately $39.7 million and result in a corresponding
    increase in cash flow from financing activities.

Amendment to Consolidation:

In June 2009, the
    FASB issued guidance that requires an enterprise to perform an
    analysis to determine whether the enterprise’s variable
    interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest
    in a variable interest entity (which would result in the
    enterprise being deemed the primary beneficiary of that entity
    and, therefore, obligated to consolidate the variable interest
    entity in its financial statements); to require ongoing
    reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary
    beneficiary of a variable interest entity; to revise guidance
    for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity;
    and to require enhanced disclosures that will provide more
    transparent information about an enterprise’s involvement
    with a variable interest entity. The guidance is not expected to
    have a material impact on the Company’s results of
    operations, cash flows, or financial position.

Amendment to Fair Value Measurements and
    Disclosures:

In January 2010, the FASB enhanced
    and clarified disclosure requirements regarding fair value of
    financial instruments for interim and annual reporting periods.
    The guidance requires additional disclosure for transfer
    activity pertaining to Level 1 & 2 fair value
    measurements and purchase, sale, issuance, and settlement
    activity for Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally,
    the FASB clarified disclosure requirements related to level of
    disaggregation, inputs and valuation techniques used to measure
    fair value. The guidance is effective for interim and annual
    reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except
    for the disclosures related to Level 3 fair value
    measurement activity which is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2010.

The Company will adopt the following new accounting standards as
    of January 1, 2011, the first day of its 2011 fiscal year:

Amendment to Software:

In October 2009, the
    FASB changed the accounting model for revenue arrangements for
    certain tangible products containing software components and
    nonsoftware components. The guidance provides direction on how
    to determine which software, if any, relating to the tangible
    product is excluded from the scope of the software revenue
    guidance. The amendment will be effective prospectively for
    fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The
    Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the
    impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows,
    and financial position.

Amendment to Revenue Recognition:

In October
    2009, the FASB established the criteria for multiple-deliverable
    revenue arrangements by establishing new guidance on how to
    separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate
    arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting.
    Additionally, this requires vendors to expand their disclosures
    around multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements and will be
    effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
    materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
    June 15, 2010. The Company is currently evaluating the
    guidance to determine the impact on the Company’s results
    of operations, cash flows, and financial position.

    Acquisitions

Acquisition of
    Arrow International, Inc.

On October 1, 2007, the Company acquired all of the
    outstanding capital stock of Arrow International, Inc.
    (“Arrow”) for approximately $2.1 billion. Arrow
    is a global provider of catheter-based access and therapeutic
    products for critical and cardiac care. The transaction was
    financed with cash, borrowings under a new senior secured
    syndicated bank loan and proceeds received through the issuance
    of privately placed notes. The results of operations for Arrow
    are included in the Company’s Medical Segment from the date
    of acquisition.

Under the terms of the transaction, the Company paid $45.50 per
    common share in cash, or $2,094.6 million in total, to
    acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Arrow. In
    addition, the Company paid $39.1 million in cash for
    outstanding stock options of Arrow. Pursuant to the terms of the
    agreement, upon the change in control of Arrow, Arrow’s
    outstanding stock options became fully vested and exercisable
    and were cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an
    amount for each share subject to the stock option, equal to the
    excess of $45.50 per share over the exercise price per share of
    each option. The aggregate purchase price of
    $2,104.0 million includes transaction costs of
    approximately $10.8 million.

In conjunction with the acquisition of Arrow, the Company repaid
    approximately $35.1 million of debt, representing
    substantially all of Arrow’s existing outstanding debt as
    of October 1, 2007.

The Company financed the all cash purchase price and related
    transaction costs associated with the Arrow acquisition, and the
    repayment of substantially all of Arrow’s outstanding debt
    with $1,672.0 million from borrowings under a new senior
    secured syndicated bank loan and proceeds received through the
    issuance of privately placed notes (see Note 9
    “Borrowings”) and cash on hand of approximately
    $433.5 million.

The acquisition of Arrow was accounted for under the purchase
    method of accounting. As such, the cost to acquire Arrow was
    allocated to the respective assets and liabilities acquired
    based on their preliminary estimated fair values as of the
    closing date.

The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation of
    the cost to acquire Arrow based on the fair values as of

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Certain assets acquired in the Arrow transaction qualify for
    recognition as intangible assets apart from goodwill. The
    estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired included
    customer related intangibles of $497.7 million, trade names
    of $249.0 million and purchased technology of
    $153.4 million. Customer related intangibles have a useful
    life of 25 years and purchased technology have useful lives
    ranging from 7-15 years. Trade names have an indefinite
    useful life. A portion of the purchase price allocation,
    $30 million, representing in-process research and
    development was deemed to have no future alternative use and was
    charged to expense as of the date of the combination. Goodwill
    is not deductible for tax purposes.

The amount of the purchase price allocated to the acquired
    in-process research and development represents the estimated
    value based on risk-adjusted cash flows related to in-process
    projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and
    have no alternative future uses as of the date of the
    acquisition. The primary basis for determining the technological
    feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval
    to market the underlying products. If the products are not
    successful or completed in a timely manner, the Company may not
    realize the financial benefits expected for these projects.

The value assigned to the acquired in-process technology was
    determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired
    technology into commercially viable products, estimating the
    resulting net cash flows from the projects, and discounting the
    net cash flows to their present value. The revenue projections
    used to value the acquired in-process research and development
    was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth
    factors, expected trends in technology, and the nature and
    expected timing of new product introductions by us and our
    competitors. The resulting net cash flows from such projects
    were based on our estimates of cost of sales, operating
    expenses, and income taxes from such projects.

The rate of 14 percent utilized to discount the net cash
    flows to their present value was based on estimated cost of
    capital calculations and the implied rate of return from the
    Company’s acquisition model plus a risk premium. Due to the
    nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the
    developmental projects, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates
    were used for the in-process research and development projects.
    The discount rates are based on the stage of completion and
    uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the
    purchased in-process technology projects.

The purchased in-process technology of Arrow relates to research
    and development projects in the following product families:
    Central Venus Access Catheters and Specialty Care Catheters.

The most significant purchased set of in-process technologies
    relates to the CVC Product Family for which the Company has
    estimated a value of $25 million. The projects included in
    this product family’s in-process technology include the
    Pressure Injectable CVC, PICC Triple Lumen, Antimicrobial PICC,
    and certain Catheter Tip Positioning Technology.

The remaining purchased set of in-process technologies relates
    to the Specialty Care Product Family for which the Company has
    estimated a value of $5 million. The projects included in
    this product family’s in-process technology include the
    Ethanol Lock Program and Antimicrobial Chronic Hemodialysis
    Catheter.

    Income taxes for more information concerning the repatriation of
    cash.

Integration of
    Arrow

In 2007 in connection with the acquisition of Arrow, the Company
    formulated a plan related to the future integration of Arrow and
    the Company’s Medical businesses. The integration plan
    focused on the closure of Arrow corporate functions and the
    consolidation of manufacturing, sales, marketing, and
    distribution functions in North America, Europe and Asia. The
    Company reassessed its estimate of the costs to implement the
    plan in the fourth quarter of 2008, which resulted in a net
    $8.5 million reduction of the costs to implement the plan
    that was charged to goodwill and changed the allocation of the
    purchase price. The reduction in the reserve principally
    resulted from the Company’s ability to re-negotiate certain
    foreign distribution agreements that were originally deemed to
    be contract termination costs, fewer people taking relocation
    packages than was originally estimated, lower employee and lease
    termination costs and an overall finalization of the plan for
    amounts different than originally estimated. In some instances,
    the Company changed the focus of the original plan from an Arrow
    facility to a Teleflex facility which resulted in an increase in
    future estimated restructuring expenses (see Note 4
    “Restructuring”). In 2009, principally as a result of
    fewer people taking relocation packages and lower employee
    termination costs, the Company reduced its integration accrual
    by approximately $4.2 million. The reduction was charged to
    goodwill, net of $1.6 million in taxes.

The Company recognized an aggregate amount of $31.6 million
    as a liability assumed in the acquisition of Arrow, and included
    in the allocation of the purchase price, for the estimated costs
    to carry out the integration plan. Of this amount,
    $18.4 million related to employee termination costs,
    $4.3 million related to facility

Impairment
    Charges

During the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded
    $2.3 million in impairment charges with respect to an
    intangible asset in the Commercial Segment. In 2004, the Company
    contributed property and other assets that had been part of one
    of its former manufacturing sites to a real estate venture in
    California. During the third quarter of 2009, based on continued
    deterioration in the California real estate market, the Company
    concluded that its investment was not recoverable and recorded
    $3.3 million in impairment charges to fully write-off its
    investment in this venture. During 2009 asset impairments of
    $0.2 million were recorded in the restructuring programs
    for the disposal of assets, primarily furniture and fixtures.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the following events took
    place:

•

Charges of $2.7 million were recorded in the fourth quarter
    of 2008 related to five of the Company’s minority held
    investments due to deteriorating economic conditions.

Note 5 —
    Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company performed an interim review of goodwill and
    intangible assets in the Marine and Cargo Container reporting
    units during the second quarter of 2009 and determined that
    $6.7 million of goodwill in the Cargo Container operations
    and $2.3 million of indefinite lived trade names in the
    Marine operations were impaired. Accordingly, the Company
    recorded a $9.0 million impairment charge with respect to
    these assets. The Company performed this interim review as a
    result of the difficult market conditions in which these
    reporting units were operating and the significant deterioration
    in the operating performance of these reporting units which
    accelerated in the second quarter of 2009.

In performing the goodwill impairment test, the Company
    estimated the fair values of these two reporting units by a
    combination of (i) estimation of the discounted cash flows
    of each of the reporting units based on projected earnings in
    the future (the income approach) and (ii) analysis of sales
    of similar assets in actual transactions (the market approach).
    Using this methodology, the Company determined that the entire
    $6.7 million of goodwill in the Cargo Container reporting
    unit was impaired, but that goodwill in the Marine reporting
    unit was not impaired. In performing the impairment test for the
    indefinite lived intangibles, the Company estimated the direct
    cash flows associated with the applicable intangible assets
    using a “relief from royalty” methodology associated
    with revenues projected to be generated from these intangibles.
    Under this methodology, the owner of an intangible asset must
    determine the arms length royalty that likely would have been
    charged if the owner had to license that asset from a third
    party. This analysis indicated that certain trade names in the
    Marine reporting unit were impaired by $2.3 million.

In 2008, certain trade names in the Commercial Segment were
    determined to be impaired by $0.8 million. In 2007, an
    impairment charge of $2.4 million was made to goodwill.

On October 1, 2007, the Company acquired all of the
    outstanding capital stock of Arrow for approximately
    $2.1 billion. The transaction was financed with cash,
    borrowings under a new senior secured syndicated bank loan and
    proceeds received through the issuance of privately placed notes.

In connection with the acquisition, the Company entered into a
    credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
    administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication
    agent, the guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto
    and each other party thereto, (the “senior credit
    agreement”). The senior credit agreement provides for a
    five-year term loan facility of $1.4 billion and a
    five-year revolving line of credit facility of
    $400 million, both of which carried initial interest rates
    of LIBOR plus a spread of 150 basis points. The spread is
    subject to adjustment based upon the Company’s consolidated
    leverage ratio (generally, Consolidated Total Indebtedness to
    Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Senior Credit
    Facility). At December 31, 2009, the spread over LIBOR was
    125 basis points. The Company also executed an interest
    rate swap for $600 million of the term loan from a floating
    3 month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate to a fixed rate of
    4.75%. The swap amortizes down to a notional value of
    $350 million at maturity in 2012. The obligations under the
    senior credit agreement are obligations of the Company and
    substantially all of its material wholly-owned domestic
    subsidiaries of the Company and are secured by a pledge of
    shares of certain of the Company’s domestic and foreign
    subsidiaries.

In addition, the Company (i) entered into a Note Purchase
    Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2007, among Teleflex
    Incorporated and the several purchasers party thereto (the
    “Note Purchase Agreement”) under which the Company
    issued $200 million in new senior secured notes pursuant
    thereto (the “2007 notes”), (ii) amended the
    terms of the note purchase agreement dated July 8, 2004 and
    the notes issued pursuant thereto (the “2004 notes”)
    and the note purchase agreement dated October 25, 2002 and
    the notes issued pursuant thereto (the “2002 notes”
    and, together with the 2004 notes, the “amended
    notes”) and (iii) repaid $10.5 million of notes
    issued pursuant to the note agreements dated November 1,
    1992 and December 15, 1993 (the “retired notes”).

The 2007 notes and the amended notes, referred to collectively
    as the “senior notes”, rank pari passu in right of
    repayment with the Company’s obligations under the senior
    credit agreement (the “primary bank obligations”) and
    are secured and guaranteed in the same manner as the primary
    bank obligations. The senior notes have mandatory prepayment
    requirements upon the sale of certain assets and may be
    accelerated upon certain events of default, in each case, on the
    same basis as the primary bank obligations.

The interest rates payable on the amended notes were also
    modified in connection with the foregoing transactions.
    Effective October 1, 2007, (a) the 2004 notes bear
    interest on the outstanding principal amount at the following
    rates: (i) 7.66% in respect of the

Series 2004-1

Tranche A Senior Notes due 2011; (ii) 8.14% in

respect of the

Series 2004-1

Tranche B Senior Notes due 2014; and (iii) 8.46% in
    respect of the

Series 2004-1

Tranche C Senior Notes due 2016; and (b) the 2002
    notes bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at the
    rate of 7.82% per annum. Interest rates on the amended notes are
    subject to reduction based on positive performance by the
    Company relative to certain financial ratios. During 2009, the
    Company repaid the 2002 notes and attained a 25 basis point
    reduction on the 2004 notes.

The senior credit agreement and the agreements with the holders
    of the senior notes contain covenants that, among other things,
    limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its
    subsidiaries to incur debt, create liens, consolidate, merge or
    dispose of certain assets, make certain investments, engage in
    acquisitions, pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions
    in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements.
    Under the most restrictive of these provisions, on an annual
    basis $223 million of retained earnings was available for
    cash dividends and stock repurchases. The senior credit
    agreement and the senior note agreements also require the
    Company to maintain certain consolidated leverage and interest
    coverage ratios. Currently, the Company is required to maintain
    a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 3.5 to 1 and a
    consolidated interest coverage ratio (generally, Consolidated
    EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined in the
    senior credit agreement) of not less than 3.5 to 1. At
    December 31, 2009 the Company’s consolidated leverage
    ratio was 2.95:1 and its interest coverage ratio was 4.92:1,
    both of which are in compliance with the limits mentioned in the
    preceding sentence. As of December 31, 2009, the Company
    was in compliance with all other terms of the senior credit
    agreement and the senior notes.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had no borrowings and
    approximately $5 million of standby letters of credit
    issued under its revolving line of credit. The Company has
    approximately $395 million available in committed financing
    through the senior credit agreement.

The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet
    as of December 31, 2009 for long-term debt is
    $1,192.5 million. Using a discounted cash flow technique
    that incorporates a market interest yield curve with adjustments
    for duration, optionality, and risk profile, the Company has
    determined the fair value of its debt to be
    $1,152.9 million at December 31, 2009. The
    Company’s implied credit rating is a factor in determining
    the market interest yield curve.

Notes payable at December 31, 2009 consists of demand loans
    due to banks of $4.0 million borrowed at an average
    interest rate of 6.54%.

The aggregate amounts of notes payable and long-term debt

During 2009, clearance of the Company’s interest rate swap
    and forward rate contracts hedge results to income contributed
    approximately $12.3 and $2.0 million, respectively, to the
    increase in other comprehensive income.

During 2008, revaluations of our interest rate swap resulted in
    a $23.4 million decrease to other comprehensive income. The
    decrease is due to a reduction in the benchmark interest
    rate — 3 month USD LIBOR. Additions and
    revaluations of our forward rate contracts contributed
    approximately $6.5 million to the decrease in other
    comprehensive income.

Valuation
    Techniques

The Company has determined the fair value of its financial
    assets based on Level 1 and Level 2 inputs and the
    fair value of its financial liabilities based on Level 2
    inputs in accordance with the fair value hierarchy established
    under accounting standards. The Company’s financial assets
    valued based upon Level 1 inputs are comprised of
    investments in marketable securities held in Rabbi Trusts which
    are used to pay benefits under certain deferred compensation
    plan benefits. Under these deferred compensation plans,
    participants designate investment options to serve as the basis
    for measurement of the notional value of their accounts. The
    investment assets of the rabbi trust are valued using quoted
    market prices multiplied by the number of shares held in the
    trust.

The Company’s financial assets valued based upon
    Level 2 inputs are comprised of foreign currency forward
    contracts. The Company’s financial liabilities valued based
    upon Level 2 inputs are comprised of an interest rate swap
    contract and foreign currency forward contracts. The Company has
    taken into account the creditworthiness of the counterparties in
    measuring fair value. The Company uses forward rate contracts to
    manage currency transaction exposure and interest rate swaps to
    manage exposure to interest rate changes. The fair value of the
    interest rate swap contract is developed from market-based
    inputs under the income approach using cash flows discounted at
    relevant market interest rates. The fair value of the foreign
    currency forward exchange contracts represents the amount
    required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar
    remaining maturities based on quoted market prices. See
    Note 10, “Financial Instruments” for additional
    information.

    Shareholders’ equity

The authorized capital of the Company is comprised of
    200 million common shares, $1 par value, and 500,000
    preference shares. No preference shares have been outstanding
    during the last three years.

On June 14, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of
    outstanding Company common stock. Repurchases of Company stock
    under the Board authorization may be made from time to time in
    the open market and may include privately-negotiated
    transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to
    regulatory considerations. The stock repurchase program has no
    expiration date and the Company’s ability to execute on the
    program will depend on, among other factors, cash requirements
    for acquisitions, cash generation from operations, debt
    repayment obligations, market conditions and regulatory
    requirements. In addition, under the senior loan agreements
    entered into October 1, 2007, the Company is subject to
    certain restrictions relating to its ability to repurchase
    shares in the event the Company’s consolidated leverage
    ratio exceeds certain levels, which may further limit the
    Company’s ability to repurchase shares under this Board
    authorization. Through December 31, 2009, no shares have
    been purchased under this Board authorization.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
    the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed in the same
    manner except that the weighted average number of shares is
    increased for dilutive securities. The difference between basic
    and diluted weighted average common shares results from the
    assumption that dilutive stock options were exercised. A
    reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares
    outstanding is as follows:

    Stock compensation plans

The Company has two stock-based compensation plans under which
    equity-based awards may be made. The Company’s 2000 Stock
    Compensation Plan (the “2000 plan”) provides for the
    granting of incentive and non-qualified stock options and
    restricted stock units to directors, officers and key employees.
    Under the 2000 plan, the Company is authorized to issue up to
    4 million shares of common stock, but no more than 800,000
    of those shares may be issued as restricted stock. Options
    granted under the 2000 plan have an exercise price equal to the
    average of the high and low sales prices of the Company’s
    common stock on the date of the grant, rounded to the nearest
    $0.25. Generally, options granted under the 2000 plan are
    exercisable three to five years after the date of the grant and
    expire no more than ten years after the grant. Outstanding
    restricted stock units

generally vest in one to three years. In 2009, the Company
    granted incentive and non-qualified options to purchase
    5,000 shares of common stock and granted restricted stock
    units representing 175,684 shares of common stock under the
    2000 plan. As of December 31, 2009, 294,858 shares
    were available for future grant under the 2000 plan.

The Company’s 2008 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2008
    plan”) provides for the granting of various types of
    equity-based awards to directors, officers and key employees.
    These awards include incentive and non-qualified stock options,
    stock appreciation rights, stock awards and other stock-based
    awards. Under the 2008 plan, the Company is authorized to issue
    up to 2.5 million shares of common stock, but grants of
    awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights
    may not exceed 875,000 shares. Options granted under the
    2008 plan have an exercise price equal to the closing price of
    the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. In 2009,
    the Company granted incentive and non-qualified options to
    purchase 471,144 shares of common stock under the 2008
    plan. As of December 31, 2009, 2,033,856 shares were
    available for future grant under the 2008 plan.

Stock-based compensation expense is measured using a multiple
    point Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account
    highly subjective and complex assumptions. The expected life of
    options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award,
    as well as historical exercise behavior, and represents the
    period of time that options granted are expected to be
    outstanding. Expected volatilities are based on a blend of
    historical volatility and implied volatility derived from
    publicly traded options to purchase the Company’s common
    stock, which the Company believes is more reflective of the
    market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility
    than solely using historical volatility. The risk-free interest
    rate is the implied yield currently available on
    U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term
    equal to the expected life of the option.

The fair value for options granted in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
    estimated at the date of grant using a multiple point
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following
    weighted-average assumptions were used:

The fair value for non-vested shares granted in 2009, 2008 and

    on the grant date discounted for the risk free interest rate and
    the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period.

The Company applied a simplified method to establish the
    beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool
    (“APIC Pool”) related to the tax effects of employee
    stock-based compensation and to determine the subsequent impact
    on the APIC Pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of
    the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that
    are outstanding.

In 2007, the Company repatriated approximately $197 million
    of cash from foreign subsidiaries which had previously been
    deemed to be permanently reinvested in the respective foreign
    jurisdictions and changed its position with respect to certain
    previously untaxed foreign earnings to treat these earnings as
    no longer permanently reinvested. The change in the permanently
    reinvested treatment of the previously untaxed foreign earnings
    allows for future cash repatriations to be used to service debt.
    As a result of the change in its permanently reinvested
    position, the Company recorded a tax charge of approximately
    $80.9 million.

The income taxes receivable of $100.7 million is principally
    comprised of overpayments of estimated taxes in the U.S. and
    Germany which the Company will seek and receive funds in 2010.

In 2009, the Company sold its interest in Airfoil Technologies
    International Singapore and several related entities and sold
    several entities in its Power Systems division. These businesses
    had income before taxes for 2008 and 2007 of $75.3 million
    and $31.1 million, respectively, which are reported as part
    of discontinued operations. The company recorded a gain on the
    sale of these businesses of $272.3 million along with
    related taxes on the gain of $102.9 million. The gain and
    related taxes are reported as discontinued operations.

In 2007, the Company also completed the sale of two significant
    business units: 1) the precision-machined components
    business in the Aerospace segment, and 2) the automotive
    and industrial driver controls, motion systems and fluid
    handling systems business in the Commercial segment. These
    business units had income before taxes for 2007 of
    $50.5 million, which has been reported as part of
    discontinued operations, along with the related taxes on income
    of $15.5 million. The Company recorded gains on the sale of
    these business units of $299.5 million, along with the
    related taxes on the gain of $145.6 million. The gain and
    related taxes have also been reported as part of discontinued
    operations.

At December 31, 2009, the cumulative unremitted earnings of
    other subsidiaries outside the United States, considered
    permanently reinvested, for which no income or withholding taxes
    have been provided, approximated $566.0 million. Such
    earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely and, as a
    result, no deferred tax liability has been recognized with
    regard to the remittance of such earnings. It is not practicable
    to estimate the income tax liability that might be incurred if
    such earnings were remitted to the United States.

During the fourth quarter of 2009, we determined that an
    out-of-period adjustment was required to correct our financial
    statement tax related balance sheet accounts. Correction of this
    error decreased deferred tax liabilities and our taxes payable
    by approximately $2.6 million and reduced income tax
    expense approximately $2.6 million. Based on our analysis,
    we concluded that this matter was not material on a quantitative
    or qualitative basis to the prior period financial statements
    and, as such, is being corrected in the current period.

Under the tax laws of various jurisdictions in which the Company
    operates, deductions or credits that cannot be fully utilized
    for tax purposes during the current year may be carried forward,
    subject to statutory limitations, to reduce taxable income or
    taxes payable in a future tax year. At December 31, 2009,
    the tax effect of such carry forwards approximated
    $72.3 million. Of this amount, $8.6 million has no
    expiration date, $3.8 million expires after 2009 but before
    the end of 2014 and $59.9 million expires after 2014. A
    substantial amount of these carry forwards consist of tax losses
    which were acquired in an acquisition by the Company in 2004.
    Therefore, the utilization of these tax attributes is subject to
    an annual limitation imposed by Section 382 of the Internal
    Revenue Code. It is not expected that this annual limitation
    will prevent the Company from utilizing its carry forwards. The
    determination of state net operating loss carry forwards is
    dependent upon the U.S. subsidiaries’ taxable income
    or loss, apportionment percentages and other respective state
    laws, which can change from year to year and impact the amount
    of such carry forward.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of
    $49.2 million and $57.9 million at December 31,
    2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, relates
    principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain
    deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carry
    forwards in various jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was
    calculated in accordance with accounting standards, which
    requires that a valuation allowance be established and
    maintained when it is “more likely than not” that all
    or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
    valuation allowance decrease in 2009 was primarily attributable
    to the sale of entities associated with Power Systems
    operations, utilization of certain foreign net operating losses
    and movement in unrealized gain/loss in relation to pension
    valuation.

Several foreign subsidiaries formerly operated under separate
    “tax holiday” arrangements as granted by certain
    foreign jurisdictions. The most significant of these was related
    to Airfoil Technologies Singapore International which was
    divested in 2009. There are several small transitional
    agreements in place that are not material in nature and will in
    general be phased out by 2012.

Uncertain Tax Positions:

On January 1,
    2007, the Company adopted the provisions under revised
    accounting standards related to income taxes. As a result of
    that adoption, the Company recognized a charge of
    $14.2 million to retained earnings. A reconciliation of the

    $0.4 million respectively ($3.0 million and
    $1.1 million respectively for the year ended
    December 31, 2008). The corresponding liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets for interest and penalties were
    $14.9 million and $6.7 million respectively at
    December 31, 2009 ($14.4 million and $6.2 million

The taxable years that remain subject to examination by major
    tax jurisdictions are as follows:

The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to income
    tax examinations by various taxing authorities. As of
    December 31, 2009, the most significant tax examinations in
    process are in the jurisdictions of the United States, Czech
    Republic, Germany, Italy, and France. It is uncertain as to when
    these examinations may be concluded and the ultimate outcome of
    such examinations. As a result of the uncertain outcome of these
    ongoing examinations, future examinations, or the expiration of
    statutes of limitation for certain jurisdictions, it is
    reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits
    for tax positions taken could materially change from those
    recorded as liabilities at December 31, 2009. Due to the
    potential for resolution of certain foreign and
    U.S. examinations, and the expiration of various statutes
    of limitation, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s
    unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next twelve
    months by a range of zero to $23 million.

Note 15 —
    Pension and other postretirement benefits

The Company has a number of defined benefit pension and
    postretirement plans covering eligible U.S. and

non-U.S. employees.

The defined benefit pension plans are noncontributory. The
    benefits under these plans are based primarily on years of
    service and employees’ pay near retirement. The
    Company’s funding policy for U.S. plans is to
    contribute annually, at a minimum, amounts required by
    applicable laws and regulations. Obligations under

non-U.S. plans

are systematically provided for by depositing funds with
    trustees or by book reserves.

In 2009, the Company offered certain qualifying individuals an
    early retirement program. Based on the individuals that accepted
    the offer, the Company recognized special termination costs of
    $402 thousand in pension expense and $395 thousand in
    postretirement expense in the second quarter of 2009.

In 2008, the Company took the following actions with respect to
    its pension benefits:

•

Effective August 31, 2008, the Arrow Salaried plan, the
    Arrow Hourly plan and the Berks plan were merged into the
    Teleflex Retirement Income Plan (“TRIP”).

•

On October 31, 2008, the TRIP was amended to cease future
    benefit accruals for all employees, other than those subject to
    a collective bargaining agreement, as of December 31, 2008.

F-37

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

On December 15, 2008, the Company amended its Supplemental
    Executive Retirement Plans (“SERP”) for all executives
    to cease future benefit accruals as of December 31, 2008.
    In addition, the Company approved a plan to replace the
    non-qualified defined benefits provided under the SERP with a
    non-qualified defined contribution arrangement under the
    Company’s Deferred Compensation Plan, effective
    January 1, 2009.

In addition, on October 31, 2008, the Company’s
    postretirement benefit plans were amended to eliminate future
    benefits for employees, other than those subject to a collective
    bargaining agreement, who had not attained age 50 and whose
    age plus service was less than 65.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries provide medical,
    dental and life insurance benefits to pensioners and survivors.
    The associated plans are unfunded and approved claims are paid
    from Company funds.

The discount rates for U.S. pension plans and other benefit
    plans of 5.85% and 5.60%, respectively, were established by
    comparing the projection of expected benefit payments to the
    Citigroup Pension Discount Curve (published monthly) as of
    December 31, 2009. The expected benefit payments are
    discounted by each corresponding discount rate on the yield
    curve. Once the present value of the string of benefit payments
    is established, the Company solves for the single spot rate to
    apply to all obligations of the plan that will exactly match the
    previously determined present value.

The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve is constructed beginning
    with a U.S. Treasury par curve that reflects the entire
    Treasury and Separate Trading of Registered Interest and
    Principal Securities (“STRIPS”) market. From

F-41

TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Treasury curve, Citibank produces a AA corporate par curve
    by adding option-adjusted spreads that are drawn from the AA
    corporate sector of the Citigroup Broad Investment —
    Grade Bond Index. Finally, from the AA corporate par curve,
    Citigroup derives the spot rates that constitute the Pension
    Discount Curve. For payments beyond 30 years, the Company
    extends the curve assuming that the discount rate derived in
    year 30 is extended to the end of the plan’s payment
    expectations.

Our assumption for the Expected Return on Assets is primarily
    based on the determination of an expected return for our current
    portfolio. This determination is made using assumptions for
    return and volatility of the portfolio. Asset class assumptions
    are set using a combination of empirical and forward-looking
    analysis. To the extent that history has been skewed by
    unsustainable trends or events, the effects of those trends are
    quantified and removed. We apply a variety of models for
    filtering historical data and isolating the fundamental
    characteristics of asset classes. These models provide empirical
    return estimates for each asset class, which are then reviewed
    and combined with a qualitative assessment of long term
    relationships between asset classes before a return estimate is
    finalized. This provides an additional means for correcting for
    the effect of unrealistic or unsustainable short-term valuations
    or trends, opting instead for return levels and behavior that is
    more likely to prevail over long periods.

Increasing the assumed healthcare trend rate by 1% would
    increase the benefit obligation by $4.8 million and would
    increase the 2009 benefit expense by $0.4 million.
    Decreasing the trend rate by 1% would decrease the benefit
    obligation by $4.1 million and would decrease the 2009
    benefit expense by $0.3 million.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. and foreign
    defined benefit pension plans was $331.5 million and
    $303.4 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit
    obligation, and fair value of plan assets for U.S. and
    foreign plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of
    plan assets were $331.0 million, $330.7 million and
    $217.2 million, respectively for 2009 and
    $290.7 million, $290.1 million and
    $172.9 million, respectively for 2008.

The Company’s investment objective is to achieve an
    enhanced long-term rate of return on plan assets, subject to a
    prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing
    the security of benefits for participants. These investments are
    held primarily in equity and fixed income mutual funds. The
    Company’s other investments are largely comprised of a
    hedge fund of funds. The equity funds are diversified in terms
    of domestic and international equity securities, as well as
    small, middle and large capitalization stocks. The domestic
    mutual funds held in the plans are managed in accordance with
    the diversification and industry concentration restrictions set
    forth in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The
    Company’s target allocation percentage is as follows:
    equity securities (60%); fixed-income securities (30%) and other
    securities (10%). Equity funds are held for their expected high
    return and excess return over inflation. Fixed-income funds are
    held for diversification relative to equities and as a partial
    hedge of interest rate risk to plan liabilities. The other
    investments are held to further diversify assets within the
    plans and provide a mix of equity and bond like return with a
    bond like risk profile. The plans may also hold cash to meet
    liquidity requirements. Investment risks and returns are
    measured and monitored on an on-going basis through annual
    liability measurements and investment portfolio reviews to
    determine whether the asset allocation targets continue to
    represent an appropriate balance of expected risk and reward.

During 2008, pension plan assets decreased approximately
    $78.7 million primarily due to the downturn in the economy.
    The decrease was the primary factor for the increase in pension
    and postretirement benefit liabilities in the consolidated
    balance sheet and a significant portion of the change in
    accumulated other comprehensive income. In 2009, pension plan
    assets increased $37.2 million but continue to remain
    depressed from 2007 values.

    that it will, at its option, repair or replace, without charge,
    such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect.
    Warranty periods vary by product. The Company has recourse
    provisions for certain products that would enable recovery from
    third parties for amounts paid under the warranty. The Company
    accrues for product warranties when, based on available
    information, it is probable that customers will make claims
    under warranties relating to products that have been sold, and a

Operating leases:

The Company uses various
    leased facilities and equipment in its operations. The terms for
    these leased assets vary depending on the lease agreement. The
    Company’s future payments cannot exceed the minimum rent
    obligation plus the residual value guarantee amount. The
    guarantee amounts are tied to the unamortized lease values of
    the assets under lease, and are due should the Company decide
    neither to renew these leases, nor to exercise its purchase
    option. At December 31, 2009, the Company had no
    liabilities recorded for these obligations. Any residual value
    guarantee amounts paid to the lessor may be recovered by the
    Company from the sale of the assets to a third party.

Future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2009
    (including residual value guarantee amounts) under noncancelable
    operating leases are as follows:

We have residual value guarantees under operating leases for
    certain equipment. The maximum potential amount of future
    payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is
    approximately $9.7 million at December 31, 2009.

Accounts receivable securitization
    program:

The Company uses an accounts receivable
    securitization program to gain access to credit markets with
    favorable interest rates and reduce financing costs. As
    currently structured, accounts receivable of certain domestic
    subsidiaries are sold on a non-recourse basis to a special
    purpose entity (“SPE”), which is a bankruptcy-remote
    consolidated subsidiary of Teleflex. Accordingly, the assets of
    the SPE are not available to satisfy the obligations of Teleflex
    or any of its other subsidiaries. The SPE then sells undivided
    interests in those receivables to an asset backed commercial
    paper conduit. The conduit issues notes secured by those
    interests and other assets to third party investors.

To the extent that cash consideration is received for the sale
    of undivided interests in the receivables by the SPE to the
    conduit, it is accounted for as a sale as the Company has
    relinquished control of the receivables. Accordingly, undivided
    interests in accounts receivable sold to the commercial paper
    conduit under these transactions are excluded from accounts
    receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
    The

F-45

TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

interests for which cash consideration is not received from the
    conduit are retained by the SPE and remain in accounts
    receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The interests in receivables sold and the interest in
    receivables retained by the SPE are carried at face value, which
    is due to the short-term nature of our accounts receivable. The
    SPE has received cash consideration of $39.7 million and
    $39.7 million for the interests in the accounts receivable
    it has sold to the commercial paper conduit at December 31,
    2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. No gain or loss
    is recorded upon sale as fee charges from the commercial paper
    conduit are based upon a floating yield rate and the period the
    undivided interests remain outstanding. Fee charges from the
    commercial paper conduit are accrued at the end of each month.
    If the Company defaults under the accounts receivable
    securitization program, the commercial paper conduit is entitled
    to receive collections on receivables owned by the SPE in
    satisfaction of the amount of cash consideration paid to the SPE
    by the commercial paper conduit.

Information regarding the outstanding balances related to the
    SPE’s interests in accounts receivables sold or retained as
    of December 31, 2009 is as follows:

Other fee charges related to the sale of receivables to the

    2009 were not material.

The Company continues to service the receivables after they are
    sold to the conduit pursuant to servicing agreements with the
    SPE. No servicing asset is recorded at the time of sale because
    the Company does not receive any servicing fees from third
    parties or other income related to the servicing of the
    receivables. The Company does not record any servicing liability
    at the time of the sale as the receivables collection period is
    relatively short and the costs of servicing the receivables sold
    over the servicing period are insignificant. Servicing costs are
    recognized as incurred over the servicing period.

In the first quarter of 2010, the Company will adopt an
    amendment to accounting standards that affects the accounting
    for transfers of financial assets. Outstanding accounts
    receivable that the Company previously treated as sold and
    removed from the balance sheet will be included in accounts
    receivable, net on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet
    and the amounts outstanding under the Company’s accounts

    2009 is $39.7 million for both). In addition, while there
    has been no change in the arrangement under the Company’s
    securitization program, the adoption of this amendment will
    reduce cash flow from operations by approximately
    $39.7 million and result in a corresponding increase in
    cash flow from financing activities.

Environmental:

The Company is subject to
    contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations
    that in the future may require the Company to take further
    action to correct the effects on the environment of prior
    disposal practices or releases of chemical or petroleum
    substances by the Company or other parties. Much of this
    liability results from the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”),
    often referred to as Superfund, the U.S. Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and similar
    state laws. These laws require the Company to undertake certain
    investigative and remedial activities at sites where the Company
    conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where
    Company-generated waste was disposed.

Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost
    from site to site. These activities, and their associated costs,
    depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving
    remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and
    enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of
    potentially responsible parties. At December 31, 2009 and
    December 31, 2008, the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet included an accrued liability of $8.1 million and
    $8.9 million, respectively, relating to these matters.
    Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs and,
    under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may
    exceed the amount accrued as of December 31, 2009. The
    time-frame over which the accrued or presently unrecognized
    amounts may be paid out, based on past history, is estimated to
    be

15-20 years.

Regulatory matters:

On October 11, 2007,
    the Company’s subsidiary, Arrow International, Inc.
    (“Arrow”), received a corporate warning letter from
    the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The letter
    cites three site-specific warning letters issued by the FDA in
    2005 and subsequent inspections performed from June 2005 to
    February 2007 at Arrow’s facilities in the United States.
    The letter expresses concerns with Arrow’s quality systems,
    including complaint handling, corrective and preventive action,
    process and design validation, inspection and training
    procedures. It also advises that Arrow’s corporate-wide
    program to evaluate, correct and prevent quality system issues
    has been deficient. Limitations on pre-market approvals and
    certificates for foreign governments had previously been imposed
    on Arrow based on prior inspections and the corporate warning
    letter did not impose additional sanctions that are expected to
    have a material financial impact on the Company.

In connection with its acquisition of Arrow, completed on
    October 1, 2007, the Company developed an integration plan
    that included the commitment of significant resources to correct
    these previously-identified regulatory issues and further
    improve overall quality systems. Senior management officials
    from the Company have met with FDA representatives, and a
    comprehensive written corrective action plan was presented to
    FDA in late 2007. At the end of 2009, the FDA began its
    reinspections of the Arrow facilities covered by the corporate
    warning letter. These inspections have been substantially
    completed, and the FDA has issued certain written observations
    to Arrow as a result of those inspections. The Company is
    currently in the process of responding to those observations and
    communicating with the FDA regarding resolution of all
    outstanding issues.

While the Company continues to believe it has substantially
    remediated these issues through the corrective actions taken to
    date, there can be no assurances that these issues have been
    resolved to the satisfaction of the FDA. If the Company’s
    remedial actions are not satisfactory to the FDA, the Company
    may have to devote additional financial and human resources to
    its efforts, and the FDA may take further regulatory actions
    against the Company.

Litigation:

The Company is a party to various
    lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business.
    These lawsuits and claims include actions involving product
    liability, intellectual property, employment and environmental
    matters. Based on information currently available, advice of
    counsel, established reserves and other resources, the Company
    does not believe that any such actions are likely to be,
    individually or in the aggregate, material to its business,
    financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
    However, in the event of unexpected further developments, it is
    possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, or other
    similar matters, if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to
    the Company’s business, financial condition, results of
    operations or liquidity. Legal costs such as outside counsel
    fees and expenses are charged to expense in the period incurred.

Other:

The Company has various purchase
    commitments for materials, supplies and items of permanent
    investment incident to the ordinary conduct of business. On
    average, such commitments are not at prices in excess of current
    market.

Note 17 —
    Business segments and other information

An operating segment as a component of an enterprise
    (a) that engages in business activities from which it may
    earn revenues and incur expenses, (b) whose operating
    results are regularly reviewed by the enterprise’s chief
    operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be
    allocated to the segment and to assess its performance, and
    (c) for which discrete financial information is available.
    Based on these criteria, the Company has determined that it has
    three operating segments: Medical, Aerospace and Commercial.

The Medical Segment businesses design, manufacture and
    distribute medical devices primarily used in critical care,
    surgical applications and cardiac care. Additionally, the
    company designs, manufactures and supplies devices and
    instruments for other medical device manufacturers. Over
    90 percent of Medical Segment net revenues are derived from
    devices that are considered disposable or single use. The
    Medical Segment’s products are largely sold and distributed
    to hospitals and healthcare providers and are most widely used
    in the acute care setting for a range of diagnostic and
    therapeutic procedures and in general and specialty surgical
    applications.

Our Aerospace Segment businesses provide cargo handling systems
    for wide body and narrow body aircraft. Commercial aviation
    markets represent 95% of revenues in this segment. Markets for
    these products are generally influenced by spending patterns in
    the commercial aviation markets, cargo market trends, flights
    hours, and age and type of engines in use.

The Commercial Segment businesses principally design,
    manufacture and distribute driver controls and engine and drive
    parts for the marine market and rigging products and services.
    Commercial Segment products are used in a range of markets
    including: recreational marine, oil and gas, marine
    transportation and industrial.

During the third quarter of 2009, the Company completed the sale
    of its Power Systems operations to Fuel Systems Solutions, Inc.
    for $14.5 million and realized a loss of $3.3 million,
    net of tax. During the second quarter, the Company recognized a
    non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $25.1 million to
    adjust the carrying value of these operations to their estimated
    fair value. In the third quarter of 2009, the Company reported
    the Power Systems operations, including the goodwill impairment
    charge, in discontinued operations.

On March 20, 2009, the Company completed the sale of its
    51 percent share of Airfoil Technologies
    International — Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“ATI
    Singapore”) to GE Pacific Private Limited for
    $300 million in cash. ATI Singapore, which provides engine
    repair products and services for critical components of flight
    turbines, was part of a joint venture between General Electric
    Company (“GE”) and the Company. In December 2009, the
    Company completed the transfer of its ownership interest in the
    remaining ATI business to GE.

In the second quarter of 2008, the Company refined its estimates
    for the post-closing adjustments based on the provisions of the
    Purchase Agreement with Kongsberg Automotive Holdings on the
    sale in 2007 of the Company’s business units that design
    and manufacture automotive and industrial driver controls,
    motion systems and fluid handling systems (“the GMS
    businesses”). Also during the second quarter of 2008, the
    Company recorded a charge for the settlement of a contingency
    related to the sale of the GMS businesses. These activities
    resulted in a decrease in the gain on sale of the GMS businesses
    and are reported in discontinued operations as a loss of
    $14.2 million, with related taxes of $6.0 million.

On June 29, 2007 the Company completed the sale of Teleflex
    Aerospace Manufacturing Group (“TAMG”), a
    precision-machined components business in the Aerospace Segment
    for $133.9 million in cash and realized a pre-tax gain of
    $75.2 million.
