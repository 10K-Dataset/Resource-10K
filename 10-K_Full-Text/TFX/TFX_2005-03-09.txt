PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Teleflex Incorporated is a diversified industrial company
specializing in the design, manufacture and distribution of
specialty-engineered products. We serve a wide range of
customers in niche segments of the commercial, medical and
aerospace industries. Our products include: driver controls,
motion controls, power and vehicle management systems and fluid
management systems for commercial industries; disposable medical
products, surgical instruments, medical devices and specialty
devices for hospitals and health-care providers; and repair
products and services, precision-machined components,
cargo-handling systems and surface coatings for commercial and
military aviation as well as other industrial markets.

For more than 60 years, we have grown by providing
engineered products that help our customers meet their business
requirements. We have grown through an active program of
development of new products, introduction of products into new
geographic or end-markets and through acquisitions of companies
that can add value with related market, technology or industry
expertise. We serve a diverse customer base through operations
in 26 countries and local direct sales and distribution
networks. In 2004, products manufactured or distributed by our
operations in the United States accounted for 46 percent of
revenues and products manufactured or distributed by our
operations in other countries represented 54 percent of
revenues.

Strategic Initiatives
and Recent Developments

In 2004, we commenced a portfolio evaluation to identify
businesses for divestiture, phase out or consolidation. We have
engaged an investment banking firm to assist us in this process
and to evaluate strategic alternatives for a major portion of
the businesses that were identified as non-strategic in our
evaluation process. As a result of the initial evaluations we
completed the divestiture of six small, non-strategic businesses
during the year — four in the Commercial Segment, one
in the Medical Segment and one in the Aerospace Segment.

On November 10, 2004, we announced the initiation of a
restructuring and divestiture program designed to improve future
operating performance and position us for earnings growth in the
years ahead. The planned actions include exiting or divesting of
non-core or underperforming businesses, consolidating
manufacturing operations and reorganizing administrative
functions to enable businesses to share services. In connection
with the restructuring and divestiture program we announced
plans to actively market and divest the automotive pedal systems
business. For 2004 and comparable periods, the automotive pedal
systems business has been presented in our consolidated
financial results as a discontinued operation. We also announced
plans to substantially exit the aftermarket services portion of
the industrial gas turbine product line reported in our
Aerospace Segment. In addition, we began a program to
consolidate manufacturing facilities and continue to consolidate
administrative functions to create shared services and further
standardization of processes across the company.

In January and February 2005, we completed the divestiture of
three additional small product lines — one in the
Commercial Segment and two in the Medical Segment. On
February 28, 2005, we also completed a larger divestiture,
the sale of our surface-engineering/ specialty coatings
business. We anticipate recording a gain on the sale of
$28-$32 million in the first quarter of 2005.


Our Business
Segments

We classify our business into three business
segments — Commercial, Medical and Aerospace. For
2004, the percentages of our consolidated net revenues
represented by our segments were as follows:
Commercial — 48%; Medical — 30%; and
Aerospace — 22%. Additional information regarding our
segments is presented in Note 15 to our consolidated
financial statements included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Commercial

Our Commercial Segment businesses principally design,
manufacture and distribute driver control, motion control, power
and vehicle management and fluid management products and
systems. Our products are used by a wide range of markets
including the passenger and light truck, marine, recreational,
mobile power equipment, military, agricultural and construction
vehicle, truck and bus and various other industrial equipment
sectors. These products are provided through business operating
units organized around geographical location, market knowledge,
and technical expertise. Major manufacturing operations are
located in North America, Europe, and Asia.

Driver Controls:

This is the largest single product
category in the Commercial Segment, representing 47 percent
of Commercial Segment revenues in 2004. Products in this
category include: full manual and automatic gearshift systems,
transmission guide controls, park-lock cables, control cables,
mechanical and hydraulic steering, steering columns, throttle
controls and industrial vehicle pedal systems. Our driver
controls, for example, are used in passenger cars, boats,
trucks, agricultural vehicles and recreational vehicles. We are
a global supplier of manual and automatic gearshift systems and
control cables for passenger cars and light trucks and a leading
global provider of both mechanical and hydraulic steering
systems for recreational boats.

Motion Controls:

Products in this category represented
22 percent of Commercial Segment revenues in 2004. Motion
controls include: mechanical and electro-mechanical controls for
seat-comfort, interior flexibility, movement and regulation of
window, door, function and other safety controls and mobile
power equipment controls and products for heavy-lift
applications. While the largest portion of this category relates
to seat and interior comfort and motion systems sold to
automotive suppliers and industrial vehicle manufacturers, our
motion systems also serve a wide range of other markets and
applications. For example, we are a large supplier of safety
cable and light-duty motion controls used in mobile power
equipment, and our heavy-lift products which include heavy-duty
cables, hoisting and rigging equipment are used in oil drilling
and other industrial markets.

Power and Vehicle Management Systems:

Products in this
category represented 20 percent of Commercial Segment
revenues in 2004. Power and vehicle management systems include:
mobile auxiliary power systems, fuel management systems and
components, industrial actuation products and components,
instrumentation and electronic controls for engine and vehicle
management, diagnostics and monitoring. These products generally
address the need for greater fuel efficiency, reduced emissions,
mobile power, and improved connectivity of engine and vehicle
systems. Our major products in this category include mobile
auxiliary power units used for power and climate control in
heavy duty trucks, industrial vehicles and locomotives,
instrumentation and electronic products for marine and
industrial vehicles, and components and systems for the use of
alternative fuels in military, industrial and automotive
applications.

Fluid Management Systems:

Products in this category
represented roughly 11 percent of Commercial Segment
revenues in 2004. Fluid management products include
premium-branded, custom-manufactured and bulk hose and related
assemblies that are generally custom-designed and manufactured
to address specific requirements for vapor permeation,
durability and flexibility. Our fluid management products can be
found in automobiles, pleasure boats, remote sensing devices,
high-purity food processing, underground fuel transfer,
compressed natural gas applications and in a number of other
industrial product and equipment


applications. The largest percentage of fluid management systems
are sold to automotive and industrial customers.

The following table sets forth the percentage of revenues by end
market for 2004 for the Commercial Segment.

Backlog:

As of December 26, 2004, our backlog of
firm orders for our Commercial Segment was $185 million.
This compares with $165 million as of December 28,
2003. Substantially all of the December 26, 2004 backlog
will be filled in 2005. Standard Commercial products are
typically shipped between two weeks and three months after
receipt of order. Therefore, the backlog of such orders is not
indicative of probable revenues in any future 12-month period.

Marketing:

The majority of our Commercial Segment
products are sold to original equipment manufacturers through a
direct sales force of field representatives and technical
specialists. We also market our marine products through dealers,
distributors, and retail outlets serving owners of recreational
boats. Our mobile auxiliary power units and climate control
units are marketed by our field sales force to dealers and
owners of heavy duty trucks and industrial vehicles. Fuel
systems and components include custom applications sold directly
to military customers and to the automotive aftermarket in
Europe.

Medical

Our Medical Segment businesses develop, manufacture and
distribute disposable medical products, surgical instruments,
medical devices, and specialty devices for health-care providers
and medical equipment manufacturers. Our products are largely
sold and distributed to hospitals and health-care providers in a
range of clinical settings. These products are provided through
business operating units organized around product category,
market knowledge, geographical location and technical expertise.
Major manufacturing operations are located in North America,
Europe, and Asia.

Markets for these products are influenced by a number of factors
including demographics, utilization and reimbursement patterns
in the worldwide health-care market.


Disposable Medical Products:

This is the largest product
category in the Medical Segment, representing 58 percent of
segment revenues in 2004. Our disposable medical products are
generally used in the clinical specialty areas of anesthesia,
respiratory care and urology. Anesthesia and respiratory care
products include those used in airway management, oxygen
administration and therapy, humidification and aerosol therapy.
Urology products include: catheters, drain and irrigation
supplies. Our products are marketed under the brand names of
Rusch, HudsonRCI, Gibeck, and Sheridan. The large majority of
sales for disposable medical products are made to the hospitals/
health-care provider market with a smaller percentage to the
home health market and medical device manufacturers. A large
majority of product sales are outside of the United States.

Surgical Instruments and Medical Devices:

Products in
this category represented 35 percent of Medical Segment
revenues in 2004. Our surgical instrument and medical device
products include: hand-held instruments for general and
specialty surgical procedures, devices used in cardiovascular,
orthopedic and general surgery and minimally-invasive diagnostic
and therapeutic care. We also produce and market a range of
ligation and closure products. In addition, we provide
instrument management and sterilization services. We market
surgical instruments and medical devices under the Deknatel,
Pleur-evac, Pilling and Weck brand names. The largest percentage
of our surgical instruments and medical device sales are to
hospitals and health-care providers in North America, Europe and
Asia.

Specialty Devices:

Specialty devices represented
7 percent of Medical Segment revenues in 2004. Products in
this category include custom-designed and manufactured specialty
instruments for cardiovascular and orthopedic procedures,
specialty sutures, microcatheters, introducers and guidewires.
We also design and manufacture specialty devices and instruments
for industry leading medical device manufacturers and provide
them with outsourcing services. Our brands include Beere,
KMedic, and Deknatel. Specialty devices are generally marketed
to medical device manufacturers.

Backlog:

As of December 26, 2004, our backlog of
firm orders for our Medical Segment was $65 million. This
compares with $42 million as of December  28,
2003. Substantially all of the December 26, 2004 backlog
will be filled in 2005. Most of our medical products are sold on
orders calling for delivery within a few months. Therefore, the
backlog of such orders is not indicative of probable revenues in
any future 12-month period.

Marketing:

Medical products are sold directly to
hospitals, health-care providers, distributors and to original
equipment manufacturers of medical devices. Products sold to the
medical market are sold both through our own sales forces and
through independent representatives and independent distributor
networks.


Aerospace

Our Aerospace Segment businesses provide repair products and
services for flight and ground-based turbine engines;
manufacture and distribute precision-machined components;
design, manufacture and market cargo-handling systems; and
provide advanced surface treatments to commercial aviation,
military, power generation and industrial markets worldwide.
These products require a high degree of engineering
sophistication and are often custom-designed. They are provided
through business operating units organized by market and
technical expertise. Major operations are located in North
America, Europe and Asia.

Commercial aviation markets represent the largest percentage of
revenues in this segment. Markets for these products are
generally influenced by spending patterns in the commercial
aviation and military markets.

Repair Products and Services:

The largest single product
category in the Aerospace Segment, repair products and services
represented 38 percent of segment revenues in 2004. This
category includes repair technologies and services primarily for
critical components of flight turbines, including fan blades and
airfoils. We utilize advanced reprofiling and adaptive-machining
techniques to improve efficiency of aircraft engine performance
and reduce turnaround time for maintenance and repairs. Repair
products and services are provided through service locations in
North America, Europe and Asia. We maintain a joint venture with
GE Aircraft Engines called Airfoil Technologies International
(ATI), whose product line serves many of the industry’s
leading aircraft engine providers and a range of commercial
airlines.

Precision-Machined Components:

Products in this category
represented 22 percent of Aerospace Segment revenues in
2004. Our precision-machined components include: fan blades,
compressor blades, cases, blisks and other components for
military and commercial flight turbine engines and a range of
custom-designed and manufactured products for industrial
markets. The vast majority of our precision-machined components
are sold to original equipment manufacturers of aircraft engines
and for military applications, with a very small percentage of
products sold to industrial markets.

Cargo-Handling Systems:

Products in this category
represented 19 percent of Aerospace Segment revenues in
2004. Our cargo-handling systems include on-board cargo-handling
systems for wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, actuators, cargo
containers, aftermarket spare parts and repair services.
Marketed under the Telair International brand name, our
wide-body cargo-handling systems are sold to aircraft original
equipment manufacturers or to airlines and air freight carriers
as “buyer furnished equipment” for original
installations or as retrofits for existing equipment. Our other
Telair products in this category include: narrow-body aircraft
cargo-loading systems, and cargo containers. We also manufacture
and repair components for our systems and other related aircraft
controls including canopy and door actuators, cargo winches and
flight controls.

Surface-Engineering/ Specialty Coatings:

This product
category represented 21 percent of Aerospace Segment
revenues in 2004. Products in this segment include
highly-engineered protective coatings for components used in
aerospace and industrial applications to improve product life,
reduce corrosion and lower maintenance costs. These products are
provided in service locations and mobile field operations in
North America, Europe and Asia. In 2004 and prior, this category
also included a range of aftermarket services designed and
provided specifically for industrial gas turbine maintenance and
repair. In the second half of 2004, we exited significant
portions of the industrial gas turbine aftermarket services
business. In February 2005, we completed the divestiture of the
remainder of the surface-engineering/ specialty coatings
business.

No product lines for the Aerospace Segment amounted to more than
10% of consolidated revenues for any period presented.


The following table sets forth the percentage of revenues by end
market for 2004 for the Aerospace Segment.

Commercial Aviation

71%

Military

13%

Power Generation

11%

Industrial and Other

5%

Backlog:

As of December 26, 2004, our backlog of
firm orders for our Aerospace Segment was $294 million, of
which we expect nearly two-thirds to be filled in 2005. Our
backlog for our Aerospace Segment on December 28, 2003 was
$203 million.

Marketing:

Generally, products sold to the aerospace
market are sold through our own force of field representatives.

Discontinued
Operations

As part of our restructuring and divestiture program approved by
our Board of Directors and initiated during the fourth quarter
2004, we adopted a plan to sell our automotive pedal systems
business. We are actively marketing the business and selectively
reviewing alternatives, while we continue to serve our
Tier 1 automotive customers with these systems and provide
appropriate transition. For a more complete discussion, see
Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Government
Regulation

Government agencies in a number of countries regulate our
products and the products sold by our customers utilizing our
products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and
government agencies in other countries regulate the approval,
manufacturing and sale and marketing of many of our healthcare
products. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the
European Aviation Safety Agency regulate the manufacturing and
sale of some of our aerospace products and license the operation
of our repair stations. The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration regulates the manufacturing and sale of numerous
of our automotive products.

Competition

Given the range and diversity of our products and markets, no
one competitor offers competitive products for all the markets
and customers that we serve. In general, all of our segments and
product lines face significant competition from competitors of
varying sizes, although the number of competitors in each market
tends to be limited. We believe that our competitive position
depends on the technical competence and creative ability of our
engineering personnel, the know-how and skill of our
manufacturing personnel, and the strength and scope of our
sales, service and distribution networks.

Patents and
Trademarks

We own a portfolio of patents, patents pending and trademarks.
We also license various patents and trademarks. Patents for
individual products extend for varying periods according to the
date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in
the various countries where patent protection is obtained.
Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of
time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks.
All capitalized product names throughout this document are
trademarks owned by, or licensed to, us or our subsidiaries.
Although these have been of value and are expected to continue
to be of value in the future, we do not consider any single
patent or trademark, except for the Teleflex brand, to be
material to the operation of our business.


Suppliers and
Materials

Materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased
from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic
locations. We are not dependent on any single supplier for a
substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied
for our overall operations. Most of the materials and components
we use are available from multiple sources and where practical,
we attempt to identify alternative suppliers. Volatility in
commodity markets, particularly steel and plastic resins, can
have a significant impact on the cost of producing our products.
We cannot be assured of successfully passing these cost
increases through to all of our customers, particularly OEMs.

Seasonality

A portion of our revenues, particularly in the Commercial
Segment, are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Revenue in the
automotive market is generally reduced in the third quarter of
each year as a result of preparations by vehicle manufacturers
for the upcoming model year. In addition, marine aftermarket
revenues generally increase in the second quarter as boat owners
prepare their watercraft for the upcoming season.

Employees

We employed approximately 21,300 full-time and temporary
employees at December 26, 2004. Of these employees,
approximately 8,900 were employed in the United States and
12,400 in countries outside of the United States. Less than
10 percent of our employees in the United States were
covered by union contracts. We have government-mandated
collective-bargaining arrangements or union contracts that cover
employees in other countries. We believe we have good relations
with our employees.

Investor

We are subject to the informational requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Therefore, we file reports and
information, proxy statements and other information with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Such reports, proxy and
information statements and other information may be obtained by

Risk Factors

All statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking
statements. The words “anticipate”,
“believe”, “estimate”, “expect”,
“intend”, “may”, “plan”,
“will”, “would”, “should”,
“guidance”, “potential”,
“continue”, “project”, “forecast”,
“confident”, “prospects”, and similar
expressions typically are used to identify forward-looking
statements. Forward-


looking statements are based on the then-current expectations,
beliefs, assumptions, estimates and forecasts about our business
and the industry and markets in which we operate. These
statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve
risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to
predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ
materially from what is expressed or implied by these
forward-looking statements. Factors which may affect our
business, financial condition and operating results include
changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from
major customers or suppliers, including delays or cancellations
in shipments; demand for and market acceptance of new and
existing products; our ability to integrate acquired businesses
into our operations, realize planned synergies and operate such
businesses profitably in accordance with expectations; our
ability to effectively execute our restructuring and divestiture
program; competitive market conditions and resulting effects on
revenues and pricing; increases in raw material costs that
cannot be recovered in product pricing; and global economic
factors, including currency exchange rates, difficulties
entering new markets and general economic conditions such as
interest rates. More information about potential factors that
could affect us is provided below. We expressly disclaim any
intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements,
except as otherwise specifically stated by us.

The costs associated with our restructuring and divestiture
program may be greater than expected.

We are engaged in a restructuring and divestiture program, which
requires management to utilize significant estimates related to
realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete and
expenses for severance and other employee separation costs,
lease cancellation and other exit costs. Actual results could
differ materially from those estimated due to, among other
things: inability to sell businesses at prices, or within
time-periods, anticipated by management; unanticipated
expenditures in connection with the effectuation of the program;
costs and length of time required to comply with legal
requirements applicable to certain aspects of the program; and
unanticipated difficulties in connection with consolidation of
manufacturing and administrative functions.

Many of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and,
accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the
economy.

Many of the business areas in which we operate are subject to
specific industry and general economic cycles, most acutely in
the automotive, marine, aerospace and transportation industries.
Accordingly, any downturn in these or other markets in which we
participate could materially adversely affect us. Moreover, if
demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly, our results
of operations could be materially adversely affected in any
given quarter. The diversified nature of our business reduces
the risk that all of our operations would experience
simultaneous cyclical downturns.

We are subject to risks associated with our
non-U.S. operations.

We have significant manufacturing operations outside the United
States, including joint ventures and other alliances. As of
December 26, 2004, approximately 47% of our total assets
and 54% of our total revenues were attributable to operations
outside the U.S. Our international operations are subject
to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside
the U.S., including:


•

differing protection of intellectual property;

•

and unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist
    attacks against American interests.

These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on
our international operations or on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. No material concentration
exists in any single country.

Our products are typically integrated into other
manufacturers’ products. As a result changes in demand for
our customers’ products may adversely affect our revenues
on short notice.

Many of our customers in the Commercial and our Aerospace
segments, including OEMs, integrate our products into products
our customers sell. Our customers also generally have no
obligation to purchase any minimum quantity of product from us
and may terminate our arrangement on short notice, typically 30
to 90 days, sometimes less. Our reported backlog may not be
realized as revenues, and revenues could materially decline if
these customers experience a reduction in demand for their
products or cancel a significant number of contracts and we
cannot replace them with similar arrangements.

Customers in our Medical Segment depend on third party
reimbursement.

Sales of some of our medical products depend on the
reimbursement to our customers of patients’ medical
expenses by government healthcare programs and private health
insurers in the countries where we do business. Internationally,
medical reimbursement systems vary significantly, with medical
centers in some countries having fixed budgets, regardless of
the level of patient treatment. Other countries require
application for, and approval of, government or third party
reimbursement. Without both favorable coverage determinations
by, and the financial support of, government and third party
insurers, there could be an impact on the market for some of our
medical products.

We cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the
current level of reimbursement to our customers for use of our
existing products. Adverse coverage determinations or any
reduction in the amount of this reimbursement could harm our
business. In addition, through their purchasing power, these
payors often seek discounts, price reductions or other
incentives from medical products suppliers. Uncertainties
regarding future healthcare policy, legislation and regulations,
as well as private market practices, could affect our ability to
sell our products in commercially acceptable quantities at
profitable prices.

Foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest
rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the
effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity
prices and interest rates. We expect revenue from
non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant
portion of our revenues. When the U.S. dollar strengthens
or weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the
countries where we sell our products, such as the euro, our
U.S. dollar-reported revenue and income will fluctuate.
Changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to
time and may, in some instances, have a significant effect on
our results of operations. Our consolidated financial statements
reflect translation of items denominated in
non-U.S. currencies to U.S. dollars, our functional
currency. We maintain a currency hedging program to minimize the
effects of this risk.

Many of our products have a significant steel and plastic resin
content. We also use quantities of other commodities, including
copper and zinc. Volatility in the prices of these commodities
could increase the costs of our products and services. We may
not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this
could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and cash flows. We monitor these exposures as an
integral part of our overall risk management program.

We depend on our ability to develop new products.

The future success of our business will depend, in part, on our
ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and
to enhance existing products, including developing electronic
technology to


replace or improve upon mechanical technology. This product
development may require substantial investment by us. There can
be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with
respect to the development, performance or market acceptance of
new technologies or products, such as the inability to: identify
viable new products; obtain adequate intellectual property
protection; gain market acceptance of new products, or
successfully obtain regulatory approvals. Moreover, we may not
otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new
products. Our failure to successfully develop and market new
products could reduce our margins, which would have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Our technology is important to our success and our failure to
protect this technology could put us at a competitive
disadvantage.

Because many of our products rely on proprietary technology, we
believe that the development and protection of these
intellectual property rights is important to the future success
of our business. In addition to relying on patent, trademark,
and copyright rights, we rely on unpatented proprietary know-how
and trade secrets, and employ various methods, including
confidentiality agreements with employees, to protect our
know-how and trade secrets. Despite our efforts to protect
proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy
or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology. The
steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of this
technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may
not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S., and
there can be no assurance that others will not independently
develop the know-how and trade secrets or develop better
technology than us or that current and former employees,
contractors and other parties will not breach confidentiality
agreements, misappropriate proprietary information and copy or
otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary
technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our
intellectual property rights.

We are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of
our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition.

We are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the
normal course of business. These lawsuits and claims include
actions involving product liability, contracts, intellectual
property, employment and environmental matters. The defense of
these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, and
we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits.
In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or
settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable
remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

The outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from our
expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including
regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict.

We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product
liability and warranty and recall claims that may be brought
against us.

We may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in
the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to
perform as expected or the use of our products results, or is
alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage.
Accordingly, we could experience material warranty or product
liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to
defend these claims. In addition, if any of our products are, or
are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate
in a recall of that product if the defect or the alleged defect
relates to safety. Product liability, warranty and recall costs
may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and results of operations.


Much of our business is subject to extensive regulation
and/or oversight by the government and failure to comply with
those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition.

Numerous national and local government agencies in a number of
countries regulate our products and the products sold by our
customers incorporating our products. The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration regulates the manufacturing and
sale of many of our automotive products. The U.S. Food and
Drug Administration regulates the approval, manufacturing and
sale and marketing of many of our medical products. The
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the European
Aviation Safety Agency regulate the manufacturing and sale of
some of our aerospace products and licenses the operation of our
repair stations. Failure to comply with applicable regulations
and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary
manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages or delays in product
manufacturing.

We are also subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and
local environmental protection and health and safety laws
governing, among other things: the generation, storage, use and
transportation of hazardous materials; emissions or discharges
of substances into the environment; and the health and safety of
our employees.

These laws and government regulations are complex, change
frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time.
We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with
current or future environmental protection and health and safety
laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases
of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our
estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations or that we will not be subject to
additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup
in the future based on our past, present or future business
activities.

There is the possibility that acquisitions and strategic
alliances may not meet revenue and/or profit expectations.

As part of our strategy for growth, we have made and may
continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into
strategic alliances. However, there can be no assurance that
these will be completed or beneficial to us. We may not be able
to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete
acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully.
Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in
the integration of the operations, technologies, services and
products of the acquired companies and the diversion of
management’s attention from other business concerns.
Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks
inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no
assurance that we will properly ascertain all such risks. In
addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future
acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial
additional indebtedness and other expenses. Future acquisitions
may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity
securities. There can be no assurance that difficulties
encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar
agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of
services.

Approximately 33% of manufacturing revenues are produced by
operations for which a significant part of our workforce is
covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar
agreements in foreign jurisdictions. It is likely that a
significant portion of our workforce will remain covered by
collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable
future. Strikes or work stoppages could occur that would
adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our
ability to conduct our business.

Item 2.    Properties

Our operations have approximately 220 owned and leased
properties consisting of plants, engineering and research
centers, distribution warehouses, offices and other facilities.
The properties are maintained in good operating condition and
are suitable for their intended use. All the plants have space
available for the activities currently conducted therein and
expected in the next several years.


Our major facilities are as follows:


In addition to the above, we own or lease approximately
2,800,000 square feet of warehousing, manufacturing and
office space located in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South
America, Europe, Australia and Asia.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

We are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the
normal course of business. These lawsuits and claims include
actions involving product liability, intellectual property,
employment and environmental matters. Based on information
currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance
coverage, established reserves and other resources, we do not
believe that any such actions are likely to be, individually or
in the aggregate, material to our business, financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity. However, in the event of
unexpected further developments, it is possible that the
ultimate resolution of these matters, or other similar matters,
if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to our business,
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

In February 2001, Go Medical Industries, Pty, Ltd. and its owner
Dr. Alexander O’Neil filed a trademark infringement
action against our subsidiary Rüsch Inc. and Medical
Marketing Group, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia. The suit alleges that
Rüsch’s manufacture and sale of a catheter infringed
upon a common law trademark held by the plaintiffs. A jury
verdict in the amount of $2,600 as “reasonable
royalty” and an additional $32,200 as “unjust
enrichment” was rendered against Rüsch in February
2004. In 2005, the trial judge entered an order rejecting the
jury award against Rüsch. In February 2005, the plaintiff
filed a notice of its intent to appeal this decision. We cannot
predict whether the appeal


will be successful or whether any judgment against Rüsch
will be awarded. Accordingly, no accrual has been recorded in
our consolidated financial statements.

stock.


Item 6.    Selected Financial
Data

(1)

Amounts exclude the impact of the automotive pedal systems
    business, which has been presented in our consolidated financial
    results as a discontinued operation.

(2)

Free cash flow and the income measure which excludes the effect
    of restructuring costs and other costs associated with our
    restructuring and divestiture program may be considered non-GAAP
    financial measures. Regulation G, “Conditions for Use
    of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” and other provisions of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“1934 Act”)
    define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP
    financial information. We use these non-GAAP financial measures
    for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing
    guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate
    period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures
    are used in addition to and in conjunction with results
    presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial
    measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP
    financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an
    additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when
    viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying
    reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures,
    provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends
    affecting our business. Management strongly encourages investors
    to review our


financial statements and
    publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any
    single financial measure. The following are reconciliations of
    these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest GAAP measures
    as required under Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

We are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth
through the continued development of our core businesses and
carefully selected acquisitions. We fueled our acquisition
growth during 2004 primarily by the third quarter acquisition of
Hudson Respiratory Care Inc., or HudsonRCI, a leading provider
of disposable medical products for respiratory care and
anesthesia. We continue to integrate HudsonRCI’s operations
into our existing Medical business. During 2004 our results also
were affected by the full year contribution from 2003
acquisitions of seven smaller businesses:


Our internal growth initiatives include the development of new
products, moving existing products into market adjacencies in
which we already participate with other products and the
expansion of market share. Our core revenue growth in 2004 as
compared to 2003, excluding the impacts of currency,
acquisitions and divestitures, was 5%.

In connection with the acquisition of HudsonRCI, we retired
certain existing credit lines, issued $350 million of
Senior Notes at fixed interest rates ranging from 5.23% to
5.85%, entered into a $400 million five-year revolving
credit facility and amended the terms of certain existing Senior
Notes to create a more effective and lower rate debt structure.

In 2004, we commenced a portfolio evaluation to identify
businesses for divestiture, phase out or consolidation. We have
engaged an investment banking firm to assist us in this process
and to evaluate strategic alternatives for a major portion of
the businesses that were identified as non-strategic in our
evaluation process. As a result of the initial evaluations we
completed the divestiture of six small, non-strategic businesses
during the year — four in the Commercial Segment, one
in the Medical Segment and one in the Aerospace Segment. These
divestitures resulted in an aggregate pre-tax gain of
$2.7 million.

On November 10, 2004, we announced the initiation of a
restructuring and divestiture program designed to improve future
operating performance and position us for earnings growth in the
years ahead. The planned actions include exiting or divesting of
non-core or underperforming businesses, consolidating
manufacturing operations and reorganizing administrative
functions to enable businesses to share services. In connection
with the restructuring and divestiture program we announced
plans to actively market and divest the automotive pedal systems
business. For 2004 and comparable periods, the automotive pedal
systems business has been presented in our consolidated
financial results as a discontinued operation. We also announced
plans to substantially exit the aftermarket services portion of
the industrial gas turbine product line reported in our
Aerospace Segment. In addition, we began a program to
consolidate manufacturing facilities and continue to consolidate
administrative functions to create shared services and further
standardization of processes across the company. Restructuring
costs were $67.6 million in 2004, of which 31% was
Commercial, 15% Medical and 54% Aerospace. All inventory
adjustments that resulted from the restructuring and divestiture
program and certain other costs associated with closing out
businesses during the fourth quarter of 2004 are included in
materials, labor and other product costs and totaled
$17.0 million in 2004, of which $4.5 million, $0 and
$12.5 million was attributed to our Commercial, Medical and
Aerospace segments, respectively.

The weakening of the U.S. dollar through 2003 and 2004,
particularly against the euro, the Swedish krona, the Canadian
dollar and the British pound, had mixed impact on our reported
results. Currency changes increased reported net revenues and
net orders by $80.3 million and $87.3 million,
respectively, in 2004, as compared to 2003.

During 2004, we adopted the provisions of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Interpretation, or FIN,
No. 46(R), “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51.” As a
result, we consolidated four small entities which had previously
not been consolidated. These entities are reported in our
Medical and Commercial segments. We also determined that it is
appropriate to separately identify and reclassify for all
periods presented minority interest and minority interest in
equity for all of our consolidated, but not wholly-owned,
subsidiaries. The minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries
previously included within selling, engineering and
administrative expenses totaled $16,534 and $16,184 for 2003 and
2002, respectively. The minority interest in equity of
consolidated affiliates previously included within other
liabilities totaled $63,443 for 2003. These reclassifications
have no impact on previously reported net income or equity.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we eliminated the one-month
lag for certain of our foreign operations to coincide with the
timing of reporting for all of our other operations. As a
result, our consolidated results for 2004 include the results of
those operations for the month of December 2003 and the entire
twelve months of 2004, whereas our consolidated results for 2003
include the results of those operations for the month of
December 2002 and the first eleven months of 2003. This change
increased our consolidated revenues for


2004 by $16,879 and reduced our consolidated income from
continuing operations before taxes and minority interest for
2004 by $1,114.

Critical Accounting
Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

We have identified the following as critical accounting
estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of
significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive
and important to the presentation of our financial condition and
results of operations and could potentially result in materially
different results under different assumptions and conditions.

Inventory Utilization

Inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market.
Inherent in this valuation are significant management judgments
and estimates concerning excess inventory and obsolescence
rates. Based upon these judgments and estimates, we record a
valuation allowance to adjust the carrying amount of our
inventories. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand
against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items
in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. In
assessing historical usage, we also qualitatively assess
business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using
historical information as an estimate of future usage.

Accounting for Long-Lived Assets

The ability to realize long-lived assets is evaluated
periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible
inability to recover their carrying amount. Such evaluation is
based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow and
profitability projections that incorporate, as applicable, the
impact on the existing business. The analyses necessarily
involve significant management judgment. Any impairment loss, if
indicated, is measured as the amount by which the carrying
amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the
asset.

Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards,
or SFAS, No. 142, we perform an annual impairment test of
our recorded goodwill. In addition, we test our other
indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. These
impairment tests can be significantly altered by estimates of
future performance, long-term discount notes and market price
valuation multiples. These estimates will likely change over
time. Many of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and
the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate
as a result of this cyclicality. Goodwill and other intangible
assets totaled $745.8 million and $386.9 million at
December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, respectively.

Accounting for Restructuring Costs

Restructuring costs, which include termination benefits,
contract termination costs, asset impairments and other
restructuring costs are recorded at estimated fair value. Key
assumptions in calculating the restructuring costs include the
anticipated sales price for discontinued operations, the terms
that may be negotiated to exit certain contractual obligations,
the realizable value of certain assets associated with
discontinued product lines and the timing of employees leaving
the company. The estimated total cost of the restructuring and
divestiture actions which commenced in November 2004 is
anticipated to be between $190 million and
$198 million.

Accounting for Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for which the
collection of the full amount of accounts receivable is
doubtful. The allowance is based on our historical experience,
the period an account is outstand-


ing, the financial position of the customer and information
provided by credit rating services. We review the allowance
periodically and adjust it as necessary. Our allowance for
doubtful accounts was $11.3 million and $9.3 million
at December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003,
respectively.

Product Warranty Liability

Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions for the
repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a
specified period after the time of the sales. We estimate our
warranty costs and liability based on a number of factors
including historical trends of units sold, recourse provisions
against third parties, the status of existing claims, recall
programs and communication with customers. Our estimated product
warranty liability was $9.7 million and $7.0 million
at December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003,
respectively.

Accounting for Income Taxes

Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within
which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when
cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other
aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing
jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax
treatment of certain items. We estimate the likelihood of these
actions and provide appropriate tax liabilities. Our income
taxes payable was $11.9 million and $42.8 million at
December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, respectively.

Results of
Operations

Discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a
purchased company up to twelve months beyond the date of
acquisition. Activity beyond the initial twelve months is
considered core growth. Core growth excludes the impact of
translating the results of international subsidiaries at
different currency exchange rates from year to year, the impact
of eliminating the one-month reporting lag for certain of our
foreign operations and the comparable activity of divested
companies within the most recent twelve-month period. The
following comparisons exclude the impact of the automotive pedal
systems business, which has been presented in our consolidated
financial results as a discontinued operation.

Comparison of 2004 and 2003

Revenues increased 15% in 2004 to $2.49 billion from
$2.15 billion in 2003. This increase was due to increases
of 5% from core growth, 5% from acquisitions, net of
dispositions, 4% from currency and 1% from the impact of
eliminating the one-month reporting lag for certain of our
foreign operations. The Commercial, Medical and Aerospace
segments comprised 48%, 30% and 22% of our revenues,
respectively.

Materials, labor and other product costs as a percentage of
revenues decreased to 71.9% in 2004 compared to 72.4% in 2003.
The decline was due to the disposition of underperforming
businesses and a favorable contribution from the HudsonRCI
acquisition. Selling, engineering and administrative expenses
(operating expenses) as a percentage of revenues increased to
19.9% in 2004 compared with 18.3% in 2003 due to increases
relative to sales in the Commercial and Aerospace segments and
higher corporate expenses which were impacted by the costs of
compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and costs
associated with the resolution of a number of legal matters.

In 2003, we sold an investment, resulting in a pre-tax gain of
$3.1 million, or $0.05 per share after tax. In 2004,
we sold six non-strategic businesses, resulting in a net pre-tax
gain of $2.7 million, or $0.04 per share after tax.

Interest expense increased in 2004 principally from higher debt
outstanding in connection with the HudsonRCI acquisition, net of
repayments and lower borrowing costs. The effective income tax
rate was 14.02% in 2004 compared with 24.24% in 2003. The lower
rate in 2004 was primarily the result of the benefit associated
with the restructuring and divestiture program. Net income for
2004 was $9.5 million, a


decrease of 91% from 2003. Diluted net earnings per share
decreased 91% to $0.24, and includes the cost of restructuring
and discontinued operations.

Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased
$3.1 million in 2004 due to increased profits from our
joint ventures.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we announced and commenced
implementation of our restructuring and divestiture program
designed to improve future operating performance and position us
for earnings growth in the years ahead. The planned actions
include exiting or divesting of non-core or low performing
businesses, consolidating manufacturing operations and
reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses to
share services.

Certain costs associated with our restructuring and divestiture
program are not included in restructuring costs. All inventory
adjustments that resulted from the restructuring and divestiture
program and certain other costs associated with closing out
businesses during the fourth quarter of 2004 are included in
materials, labor and other product costs and totaled
$17.0 million, of which $4.5 million, $0 and
$12.5 million was attributed to our Commercial, Medical and
Aerospace segments, respectively.

For 2004, the charges associated with the restructuring and
divestiture program by segment that are included in
restructuring costs were as follows:

Termination benefits are comprised of severance-related payments
for all employees terminated in connection with the
restructuring and divestiture program. Contract termination
costs relate primarily to the termination of leases in
conjunction with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities.
Asset impairments relate primarily to machinery and equipment
associated with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities as
well as goodwill associated with our industrial gas turbine
aftermarket services business . Other restructuring costs
include expenses which are directly attributable to the
restructuring and divestiture program.

As of December 26, 2004, we expect to incur the following
future restructuring costs in our Commercial, Medical and
Aerospace segments over the next 6 quarters:

Comparison of 2003 and 2002

Revenues increased 10% in 2003 to $2.15 billion from
$1.96 billion resulting from gains in the Commercial and
Medical segments, which offset a decline in the Aerospace
Segment. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, accounted for
one-half of our increase in revenue. The impact of currency
exchange rates provided the remainder of the revenue increase.
Overall core growth was down slightly. Sales from international
operations, which represented 51% of our revenues, increased 22%
in 2003 of which 11% resulted from stronger foreign currency and
5% from acquisitions. The Commercial, Medical and Aerospace
segments accounted for 51%, 25% and 24% of our revenues,
respectively.

Materials, labor and other product costs were 72.4% of revenues,
consistent with 2002. Operating expenses increased to 18.3% of
revenues in 2003 compared with 17.2% in 2002 due to increases in
the Medical Segment, and to a lesser extent the Commercial and
Aerospace segments.

In 2003, we sold an investment which resulted in a pretax gain
of $3.1 million, or $0.05 per share after tax. In
2002, we sold two minor non-core businesses and also received
insurance proceeds resulting in an aggregate $10.1 million
gain, or $0.16 per share after tax.

Interest expense increased in 2003 by $1.3 million, largely
a result of currency movement during the year. As a percent of
revenues, interest expense decreased to 1.2% compared to 1.3% in
2002. The effective income tax rate decreased to 24.24% in 2003
from 25.11% in 2002. Net income in 2003 decreased 13% to
$109.1 million from $125.3 million. Diluted earnings
per share decreased 13% from $3.15 in 2002 to $2.73 per
share in 2003.

Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased
$0.4 million in 2003 due primarily to an increase in the
Medical Segment.

We closed or severely curtailed operations at 11 facilities in
2003. Costs related to these consolidation efforts were
$9.0 million, of which 48% was Commercial, 24% Medical and
28% Aerospace. These costs were incurred throughout the year.

Segment
Reviews

The following is a discussion of our segment operating results.
Additional information regarding our segments is presented in
Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Commercial

Products in the Commercial Segment generally are produced in
higher unit volume than those of our other two segments. They
are manufactured for broad distribution as well as custom
fabricated to meet individual customer needs. Consumer spending
patterns influence the market trends for products sold to the
automotive and marine markets.

Automotive cable and shifter products are manufactured primarily
for automotive OEMs. Discussion of marine and industrial product
lines below includes the manufacturing and distribution of
driver controls, motion controls, power and vehicle management
systems and fuel management systems to the automotive supply,
marine and industrial markets.

Comparison of 2004 and 2003

Commercial Segment revenues increased 10% in 2004 to
$1.20 billion from $1.09 billion in 2003. The
improvement was due to increases of 8% from core growth, 4% from
currency and 3% from acquisitions, offset, in part, by a 5%
decrease from dispositions. Revenue from driver control products
sold to OEM’s increased slightly in 2004 compared to 2003,
with increases from currency and core growth mostly offset by


a decrease from a disposition. For the remainder of the segment,
three-fourths of the revenue improvements were the result of
core gains. Favorable currency translation provided a majority
of the remaining growth and revenues from acquired entities were
equivalent to the impact of dispositions.

Commercial Segment operating profit declined 5% in 2004 to
$105.7 million from $111.5 million in 2003. Marine and
industrial operating profit improved on volume gains which were
partially offset by a cancellation of automotive alternative
fuel programs in North America, pricing pressure in the
automotive supplier market and costs related to a new product
launch. Operating profit in the automotive cables and shifters
product line declined as a result of pricing pressure and
increased raw material costs. Operating profit as a percent of
revenues declined to 8.8% in 2004 from 10.2% in 2003.

Assets in the Commercial Segment increased $23.8 million,
as currency and receivable increases in European automotive
cable and shifter and United States light-duty cables were
tempered by the impact of business dispositions.

Comparison of 2003 and 2002

Commercial Segment revenues increased 12% to $1.09 billion
in 2003 from $972.1 million in 2002. Acquisitions and
currency translation each added 6%. In automotive cables and
shifters, favorable currency movements accounted for over 85% of
the overall improvement as core gains in Europe and Asia were
tempered by a decline in North America. Core growth outside the
United States was largely the result of increased shifter and
guide control products. In the marine and industrial product
lines, revenue increased as a result of acquisitions, including
businesses in the power and vehicle management systems and
motion controls businesses. Acquisitions accounted for nearly
three-fourths of the improvement and currency provided the
remainder. Core revenue was relatively constant as declines in
the marine aftermarket, primarily fishfinders, and alternative
fuel systems were offset by increased sales to truck, military
and automotive supply markets.

Commercial Segment operating profit increased 10% in 2003 to
$111.5 million from $101.3 million due to improvement
in the automotive cable and shifter product line. Automotive
cables and shifters operating profit improved as the result of
higher volume from new products and cost reductions which served
to more than offset the impact of customer price reductions.
Marine and industrial operating profit was flat as acquisitions
compensated for a core business decline. Core business declined
due to adverse mix as lower margin marine and truck products
replaced higher margin aftermarket products. In addition,
alternative fuel systems declined as a result of lower volume in
part related to delays in the passage of the energy bill.

Assets in this segment increased $193.9 million; 44% of the
increase resulted from acquisitions in the marine and industrial
product lines, and 37% from the impact of currency exchange
rates.

Medical

Products in the Medical Segment generally are required to meet
exacting standards of performance and have long product life
cycles. Economic influences on revenues relate primarily to
spending patterns in the worldwide medical devices and hospital
supply market.

Comparison of 2004 and 2003

Medical Segment revenues increased 40% in 2004 to
$746.2 million from $534.7 million in 2003. This
increase was due to increases of 24% from acquisitions, 6% from
core growth, 5% from currency, 3% from the impact of eliminating
the one-month reporting lag for certain of our foreign
operations and 2% from the consolidation of variable interest
entities. In disposable medical products, 59% of the growth came
from the HudsonRCI acquisition with currency and core
improvement providing a majority of the remaining increase.


In surgical instruments and medical devices, the cardiothoracic
acquisition in the third quarter of 2003 accounted for over
two-thirds of the year-over-year revenue improvement.

Medical Segment operating profit increased 37% in 2004 to
$117.2 million from $85.4 million in 2003. This
increase was driven largely by acquisitions and core volume
gains in both the disposable medical products and surgical
instruments and medical devices product lines. Operating profit
as a percent of revenues declined to 15.7% in 2004 from 16.0% in
2003.

Assets in the Medical Segment increased $521.3 million or
91% primarily due to the HudsonRCI acquisition.

Comparison of 2003 and 2002

In 2003, Medical Segment revenues increased 19% to
$534.7 million from $448.7 million. Revenues gained
10% from acquisitions and 8% from the effects of stronger
currencies while core growth remained relatively constant. In
the disposable medical products product line, two-thirds of the
revenue increase came from stronger foreign currencies. Sales in
the surgical instruments and medical devices product line
improved substantially due to acquisitions including a
cardiothoracic devices business in 2003.

Operating profit increased 18% in 2003 to $85.4 million
compared with $72.3 million in 2002. The increase in
operating profit was comprised of equal contributions from
disposable medical products volume and currency and acquisitions
in the surgical instruments and medical devices product line.
Overall operating profit as a percent of revenues declined as an
improvement in the disposable medical products product line from
volume gains was more than offset by a decline in surgical
instruments and medical devices, as a result of the acquisition.

Assets increased $70.1 million or 14%. The cardiothoracic
devices acquisition accounted for 75% of the increase.

Aerospace

Products and services in the Aerospace Segment, many of which
are proprietary, require a high degree of engineering
sophistication and are often custom-designed. Economic
influences on these products and services relate primarily to
spending patterns in the worldwide aerospace industry and to
demand for power generation.

Comparison of 2004 and 2003

Aerospace Segment revenues increased 2% in 2004 to
$538.3 million from $528.6 million in 2003. This
increase was due to increases of 2% from currency and 1% from
the impact of eliminating the one-month reporting lag for
certain of our foreign operations, offset, in part, by a 1%
decrease from dispositions. Core growth was the result of
double-digit growth in repair products and services and
precision-machined components, which more than compensated for
declines in industrial gas turbine, or IGT and cargo-handling
systems. Core revenue growth was in part due to increased sales
of lower margin offerings.

Aerospace Segment operating profit declined 168% in 2004 to a
loss of $6.3 million from a profit of $9.2 million in
2003. Operating profit declined due primarily to one-time
charges in IGT related to our restructuring and divestiture
program, pricing pressures from the aerospace OEMs and
aftermarket and higher costs in precision-machined components.
Operating profit (loss) as a percent of revenues was (1.2)% in
2004 versus 1.7% in 2003.

Assets in the Aerospace Segment declined $72.3 million or
16% due substantially to the phase-out of the IGT business.


Comparison of 2003 and 2002

In 2003 Aerospace Segment revenues decreased 2% to
$528.6 million from $542.1 million in 2002. Core
products declined by 4% while currency contributed a positive
2%. Sales declined due to weaker end markets in the IGT product
line and to a lesser extent the cargo-handling systems and
precision-machined components product lines. These declines were
tempered by an increase in repair products and services revenues
brought about by higher sales of low margin material product
offerings.

Operating profit declined 73% from $34.2 million in 2002 to
$9.2 million in 2003, while operating profit as a percent
of revenues fell to 1.7% from 6.3% in the prior year. A
significant portion of the decline was attributable to the IGT
product line which declined due to lower volume, major
investments in new parts development, and contract losses in the
engineering services business. Results in cargo-handling systems
and precision-machined components were adversely impacted by
volume declines and continued pricing pressures. Margins of
repair products and services declined due to the unfavorable
product mix.

In 2003, assets increased $11.0 million or 2% due
substantially to currency fluctuations.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Operating activities provided net cash of approximately
$254.5 million during 2004. Changes in our operating assets
and liabilities during 2004 resulted in a net cash inflow of
$13.9 million. The most significant changes were an
increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease
in inventories, offset, in part, by an increase in accounts
receivable and a decrease in income taxes payable. The increase
in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due primarily to
increased accruals associated with the restructuring and
divestiture program. The decrease in inventories was the result
of our focus on improved working capital management. The
increase in accounts receivable was largely a result of
increased business levels and the HudsonRCI acquisition. The
decrease in income taxes payable was a result of tax deductions
associated with the restructuring and divestiture program, for
which the cash benefits will be received in 2005. Our financing
activities during 2004 consisted primarily of the receipt of
$511.6 million in gross proceeds from long-term borrowings,
primarily for the acquisition of HudsonRCI. This amount is
offset by a decrease in notes payable and current borrowings of
$137.8 million and a reduction in long-term borrowings of
$77.9 million, driven by improved operating cash flow,
proceeds from the disposition of businesses and lower
year-over-year capital spending. Our investing activities during
2004 consisted primarily of payments for businesses acquired of
$458.5 million. We had net cash used in discontinued
operations of $7.0 million in 2004. See the “Interest
Rate Risk” section of Item 7A on page 28 for
additional information regarding interest rates and borrowings.

Operating activities provided net cash of approximately
$225.1 million during 2003. Changes in our operating assets
and liabilities during 2003 resulted in a net cash outflow of
$17.8 million. The most significant change was an increase
in accounts receivable, offset, in part, by an increase in
income taxes payable. Accounts receivable growth was in line
with volume improvement as accounts receivable as a percentage
of fourth quarter revenues remained flat. Our financing
activities during 2003 consisted primarily of a reduction in
long-term borrowings of $37.5 million, offset, in part, by
an increase in notes payable and current borrowings of
$35.1 million. During 2003, we also paid $30.9 million
in dividends. Our investing activities during 2003 consisted
primarily of payments for businesses acquired of
$85.2 million and capital expenditures of
$80.4 million. We had net cash used in discontinued
operations of $23.2 million in 2003.

Operating activities provided net cash of approximately
$198.2 million during 2002. Changes in our operating assets
and liabilities during 2002 resulted in a net cash outflow of
$29.5 million. The most significant change was an increase
in inventory, offset, in part, by an increase in income taxes
payable. Inventory increased in connection with new wide-body
cargo-handling systems, repair products and services programs
and IGT aftermarket parts products. Our financing activities
during 2002 consisted primarily of


reductions of $74.6 million in notes payable and current
borrowings and $34.2 million in long-term borrowings,
offset, in part, by the receipt of $53.0 million in gross
proceeds from long-term borrowings. During 2002, we also paid
$27.9 million in dividends. Our investing activities during
2002 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of
$80.6 million and payments for businesses acquired of
$57.2 million. We had net cash used in discontinued
operations of $2.2 million in 2002.

In addition to the cash generated from operations we have
approximately $285 million in committed and
$115 million in uncommitted unused lines of credit
available. The availability of the lines of credit is dependent
upon us maintaining our strong financial condition including our
continued compliance with bank covenants. Various senior note
agreements provide for the maintenance of ratios and limit the
payment of cash dividends. Under the most restrictive of these
provisions, $240 million of retained earnings was available
for dividends at December 26, 2004.

Fixed rate borrowings comprised 60% of total borrowings at
December 26, 2004. Approximately 29% of our total
borrowings of $788 million are denominated in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar, principally the euro, providing
a natural hedge against fluctuations in the value of assets
outside the United States.

The following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio:

The increase in our percent of net debt to total capital for
2004 as compared to 2003 is primarily due to additional
borrowings used to acquire HudsonRCI.

We believe that our cash flow from operations and our ability to
access additional funds through credit facilities will enable us
to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures and
additional acquisition opportunities.

    obligations relate primarily to material purchase requirements.

Off Balance Sheet
Arrangements

We have residual value guarantees under operating leases for
plant and equipment. The maximum potential amount of future
payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is
approximately $11 million. See also Note 14 to our
consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk

We are exposed to certain financial risks, specifically
fluctuations in market interest rates, foreign currency exchange
rates and, to a lesser extent, commodity prices. We are also
exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common
stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their
effect on pro forma earnings as disclosed.

Interest Rate
Risk

We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our
borrowing activities and our cash balances. Interest rate swaps
are used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk. The
table below is an analysis of the amortization and related
interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable
rate debt obligations.


Variable interest rates shown below are weighted average rates
of the debt portfolio. For the swaps, notional amounts and
related interest rates are shown by year of maturity.

Foreign Currency
Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in market values of transactions
in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain
subsidiaries. We have entered into forward contracts with
several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of
projected cash flows from these exposures. The following table
presents the significant cash flows and fair values of our open
forward currency contracts as of December 26, 2004, which
all mature in 2005.

Forward contracts are expressed in local currency amounts. The
market value of the total exchange gain is $2,865.

Additional risk is incurred as a result of the translation of
foreign subsidiary financial statements into U.S. dollars.
A movement of 10% in the value of the U.S. dollar against
foreign currencies would impact our expected net earnings by
approximately $1.4 million.

Controls and Procedures

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this report are functioning effectively to
provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be
disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to
our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute
assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system
are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
any, within a company have been detected.

(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

Our management’s report on internal control over financial
reporting is set forth in page F-2 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

The management of Teleflex Incorporated and its subsidiaries
(the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 26, 2004. In making this assessment, management
used the framework established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As a result of
this assessment and based on the criteria in the COSO framework,
management has concluded that, as of December 26, 2004, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 26, 2004 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Teleflex Incorporated:

We have completed an integrated audit of the 2004 consolidated
financial statements of Teleflex Incorporated and its
subsidiaries and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of December 26, 2004 and audits of its 2003
and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index, present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Teleflex Incorporated and
its subsidiaries at December 26, 2004 and December 28,
2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December 26, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting, appearing on page F-2, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 26, 2004 based on criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 26, 2004, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control

F-3

over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note 1 —

Summary of significant accounting policies

Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Teleflex Incorporated and its
subsidiaries (the “Company”). Intercompany
transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in
affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but
not a controlling equity interest are carried on the equity
basis. Investments in affiliates over which the Company does not
have significant influence are accounted for by the cost method.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and include management’s estimates
and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company eliminated the
one-month lag for certain of its foreign operations to coincide
with the timing of reporting for all of the Company’s other
operations. As a result, the Company’s consolidated results
for 2004 include the results of those operations for the month
of December 2003 and the entire twelve months of 2004, whereas
the Company’s consolidated results for 2003 include the
results of those operations for the month of December 2002 and
the first eleven months of 2003. This change increased the
Company’s consolidated revenues for 2004 by $16,879 and
reduced the Company’s consolidated income from continuing
operations before taxes and minority interest for 2004 by $1,114.

See Note 16 for a description of discontinued operations.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair values:

The estimated fair value amounts presented
in these consolidated financial statements have been determined
by the Company using available market information and
appropriate methodologies. However, considerable judgment is
required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of
fair value. The estimates presented herein are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a
current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions
and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on
the estimated fair value amounts. Such fair value estimates are
based on pertinent information available to management as of
December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, and have not
been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these consolidated
financial statements since such dates.

Cash and cash equivalents:

All highly liquid debt
instruments with an original maturity of three months or less
are classified as cash equivalents. At December 26, 2004
and December 28, 2003, the Company had no cash equivalents.

Accounts receivable:

Accounts receivable represents
amounts due from customers related to the sale of products. An
allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained and represents the
Company’s estimate of probable losses on realization of the
full receivable. The allowance is provided at such time that
management believes reasonable doubt exists that such balances
will be collected within a reasonable period of time. The
allowance is based on the Company’s historical experience,
the period an account is outstanding, the financial position of
the customer and information provided by credit rating services.
The allowance for doubtful accounts was $11,296 and $9,273 as of
December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, respectively.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at the lower of
average cost or market. Elements of cost in inventory include
raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. In
estimating market value, the Company evaluates inventory for
excess and obsolete quantities based on estimated usage and
sales.

Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant and
equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Costs incurred to develop internal-use computer software during
the application development stage generally are capitalized.
Costs of enhancements to internal-use computer software are
capitalized, provided that these enhancements result in
additional functionality. Other additions and those improvements
which increase the capacity or lengthen the useful lives of the
assets are also capitalized. With minor exceptions,
straight-line composite lives for depreciation of property,
plant and equipment are as follows: buildings — 20 to
40 years; machinery and equipment — 8 to
12 years. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as
incurred.

Goodwill and other intangible assets:

Goodwill and other
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized
but are tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment
losses, if any, are recorded as part of income from operations.
Two-step impairment tests are performed in the fourth quarter,
or more frequently if there is a triggering event. Business
combinations can also result in the recognition of intangible
assets.

The Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarters of
2003 and 2002 and determined that there were no impairments. In
connection with the Company’s restructuring and divestiture
program, the Company determined in the fourth quarter of 2004
that a portion of its goodwill was impaired and recorded a
charge of $18.6 million, $14.1 million of which was
included in restructuring costs and $4.5 million of which
was included in discontinued operations. The Company performed
an annual impairment test of its remaining recorded goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2004
and found no instances of impairment.

Intangible assets consisting of intellectual property, customer
lists and distribution rights are being amortized over their
estimated useful lives, which range from 4 to 30 years,
with a weighted average amortization period of 12 years.
The Company continually evaluates the reasonableness of the
useful lives of these assets.

Long-lived assets:

The ability to realize long-lived
assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances
indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount.
Such evaluation is based on various analyses, including
undiscounted cash flow and profitability projections that
incorporate, as applicable, the impact on the existing business.
The analyses necessarily involve significant management
judgment. Any impairment loss, if indicated, is measured as the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
estimated fair value of the asset.

Product Warranty Liability:

Product warranty liability
arises out of the need to repair or replace product without
charge to the customer. The Company warrants such products from
manufacturing defect. The Company estimates its warranty
liability based on historical trends of units sold, recourse
provisions against third parties, the status of existing claims,
recall programs and communication with customers.

Foreign currency translation:

Assets and liabilities of
non-domestic subsidiaries denominated in local currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange at
the balance sheet date; income and expenses are translated at
the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The
resultant translation adjustments are reported as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
shareholders’ equity.

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Derivative financial instruments:

The Company uses
derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of
hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates. All derivatives are recognized on the
balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recorded in earnings or other comprehensive
income (loss), based on whether the instrument is designated as
part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge
transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported
in other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to
earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the
underlying hedged item.

Stock-based compensation:

Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” encourages,
but does not require, companies to record compensation cost for
stock-based employee compensation plans at fair value. The
Company has chosen to continue to account for stock-based
compensation using the intrinsic method prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
related interpretations. Accordingly, compensation expense for
stock options and restricted stock issued to employees is
measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of
the Company’s stock at the date of the grant over the
amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.

The following table illustrates the pro forma net income and
earnings per share for 2004, 2003 and 2002 as if compensation
expense for stock options issued to employees had been
determined consistent with SFAS No. 123:

The fair value for options granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was
estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

Income taxes:

The provision for income taxes is
determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting
for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under this approach,
deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to
be incurred when the reported

F-11

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The
provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or
payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes
during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between
the financial and tax bases of the Company’s assets and
liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax
laws when changes are enacted. Provision has been made for
income taxes on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and
affiliates, except for subsidiaries in which earnings are deemed
to be permanently invested.

Pensions and other postretirement benefits:

The Company
provides a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired
employees, including pensions and postretirement health care.
The Company records annual amounts relating to these plans based
on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions such
as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets,
compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost
trend rates. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an
annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on
current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so.
As required, the effect of the modifications is generally
recorded or amortized over future periods.

Restructuring costs:

Restructuring costs, which include
termination benefits, contract termination costs, asset
impairments and other restructuring costs are recorded at
estimated fair value. Key assumptions in calculating the
restructuring costs include the anticipated sales price for
discontinued operations, the terms that may be negotiated to
exit certain contractual obligations, the realizable value of
certain assets associated with discontinued product lines and
the timing of employees leaving the company.

Revenue recognition:

The Company recognizes revenues from
product sales or services provided when the following revenue
recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured. This generally occurs when
products are shipped or services rendered upon customers’
acceptance.

Revenues from product sales, net of estimated returns, warranty
and other allowances based on historical experience and current
trends, are recognized upon shipment of products to customers.
Revenues from services provided are recognized as the services
are rendered and comprised less than 10% of total revenues for
all periods presented. Revenues from longer term construction
contracts are accounted for based on the percentage of
completion method and comprised 2% or less of total revenues for
all periods presented.

Reclassifications:

Certain reclassifications have been
made to the prior years’ consolidated financial statements
to conform to those classifications used in the current year.

Note 2 —

New accounting standards

Variable interest entities:

In December 2003, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46(R),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
interpretation of ARB No. 51,” which replaced
FIN No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,” and clarifies the application of Accounting
Research Bulletin (“ARB”) No. 51,
“Consolidated Financial Statements,” to certain
entities in which equity investors do not have the
characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not
have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support.
The Company adopted the provisions of the interpretation during
2004 using fair value appraisals and it did not have a material
impact on the Company’s financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. In applying the interpretation, four
previously non-consolidated entities with a net investment of
$10,000 were consolidated in the December 26, 2004
consolidated financial statements.

F-12

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Following the consolidation of certain variable interest
entities, the Company has determined that it is appropriate to
separately identify and reclassify for all periods presented
minority interest and minority interest in equity for all of its
consolidated, but not wholly-owned, subsidiaries. The minority
interest in consolidated subsidiaries previously included within
selling, engineering and administrative expenses totaled $16,534
and $16,184 for 2003 and 2002, respectively. The minority
interest in equity of consolidated affiliates previously
included within other liabilities totaled $63,443 for 2003.
These reclassifications have no impact on previously reported
net income or equity.

Medicare prescription drug costs:

On December 8,
2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (“the Act”) was signed into
law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under
Medicare Part D, as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors
of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that
is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The
Company sponsors medical programs for certain of its
U.S. retirees. In April 2004, the FASB issued Staff
Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 106-2 to address
the accounting and disclosure requirements related to the Act.
FSP No. FAS 106-2 is effective for interim or annual
periods beginning after June 15, 2004. The Company adopted
this provision during 2004 and it did not have a material impact
on the Company’s financial position, results of operations
or cash flows. On January 21, 2005, the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) released the
final regulations (the “Regulations”) implementing the
Act. Generally, the Regulations are expected to cause more
retiree health programs (or subgroups within such programs) to
meet the Act’s actuarial equivalence standard (or to result
in more years of expected actuarial equivalence) than had
originally been expected when the Act was passed. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of the Regulations on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations and
cash flows.

American Jobs Creation Act:

On October 22, 2004 the
American Jobs Creation Act (“the AJCA”) was signed
into law. The AJCA includes a deduction of 85% of certain
foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA.
The Company may elect to apply the repatriation provision
included in the AJCA to certain qualifying earnings that are
distributed during its calendar year ending 2005. The Company
has started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation
provision; however the Company does not expect to be able to
complete this evaluation until after it has concluded on a
number of factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to,
a final decision with respect to divestiture alternatives
currently under consideration and a determination of the
distributable reserves position of certain
non-U.S. subsidiaries. Further, the Company does not expect
to be able to complete its evaluation until after Congress or
the Treasury Department provide additional clarifying language
on certain elements of the repatriation provision. The Company
expects to be able to complete its evaluation within a
reasonable period following the resolution of the outstanding
issues and the issuance of clarifying language.

The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and
requirements, including adoption of a specific domestic
reinvestment plan for the repatriated funds. Based on a current
understanding of the AJCA, the Company believes that it may
repatriate from $0 to approximately $400 million in
dividends subject to the elective 85% dividends received
deduction, generating a corresponding tax expense from $0 to
$46 million. The Company expects to confirm its
understanding of this provision and may seek the required
corporate officer and Board of Directors approvals of the
requisite domestic reinvestment plan within the timeframe that
the deduction is available.

Inventory Costs:

In November 2004, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of
ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,” which clarifies the types
of costs that should be expensed rather than capitalized as
inventory. This statement also clarifies the circumstances under
which fixed overhead costs associated with operating facilities
involved in inventory processing should be capitalized. The
provisions of SFAS No. 151 are

F-13

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005.
The Company does not expect the provisions of this statement to
have a material impact on the Company’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

Stock-Based Compensation:

In December 2004, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based
Payment,” which establishes accounting standards for
transactions in which an entity receives employee services in
exchange for (a) equity instruments of the entity or
(b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the
entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the
issuance of equity instruments. SFAS No. 123(R)
requires an entity to recognize the grant-date fair value of
stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to
employees in the statement of income. The statement also
requires that such transactions be accounted for using the
fair-value-based method, thereby eliminating use of the
intrinsic value method of accounting in APB No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” which was
permitted under Statement 123, as originally issued.
SFAS No. 123(R) is effective as of the beginning of
the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after
June 15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of Statement 123(R) on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets:

In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of
Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion
No. 29.” The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29,
“Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions,” is based on
the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be
measured based on the fair value of assets exchanged. The
guidance in that Opinion, however, included certain exceptions
to that principle. This statement amends Opinion No. 29 to
eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets that do not have commercial substance. A
nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash
flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a
result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for
nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning
after June 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the
provisions of this statement to have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Acquisitions

Acquisition of Hudson Respiratory Care, Inc.

On July 6, 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of
all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Hudson
Respiratory Care Inc. (“HudsonRCI”), a provider of
disposable medical products for respiratory care and anesthesia,
for $457,499. The results for HudsonRCI are included in the
Company’s Medical Segment.

F-14

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141,
“Business Combinations.” The following table presents
the allocation of purchase price for the HudsonRCI acquisition
based on estimated fair values:

The amount allocated to goodwill is reflective of the benefit
the Company expects to realize from expanding its presence in
the health care supply market through HudsonRCI and from
expected synergies. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
Of the $103,300 in intangible assets, $40,900 was assigned to
customer relationships with estimated remaining amortizable
lives of 10 years and $900 was assigned to patents with
estimated remaining amortizable lives of 11.5 years. The
remaining $61,500 was assigned to trade names with indefinite
useful lives. The deferred tax asset is a result of
HudsonRCI’s net operating loss carryforward and a
difference in tax basis prior to acquisition.

The following table provides unaudited pro forma results of
operations for the periods noted below, as if the acquisition
had been made at the beginning of each period. The pro forma

the transaction. These expenses include bonus and stock option
settlement expenses, professional fees, broker fees and
insurance costs.

In connection with this acquisition, the Company has formulated
a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity.
The integration activities began during the due diligence
process and are expected to be completed no later than twelve
months after the acquisition. The Company has accrued estimates
for certain costs, related primarily to personnel reductions and
facility closings and the termination of certain distribution
agreements at the date of acquisition, in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue
No. 95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities in Connection

$486 is payable in 2005. The acquisitions included a
cardiothoracic devices business and an anesthesia and
respiratory care business in the Medical Segment; a designer and
manufacturer of electronic and electromechanical products for
the automotive, marine and industrial markets, a European
manufacturer of alternative fuel systems, a passenger and light
truck electronic throttle control business, a European
light-duty cable operation, and an automotive seat comfort
systems business in the Commercial Segment. Goodwill recognized
in those transactions amounted to $26,649, of which $1,780 is
expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill was
assigned to the Commercial and Medical segments in the amount of
$25,586 and $1,063, respectively. The pro forma income statement
impact of these acquisitions is not material.

2002 Acquisitions

In 2002, the Company acquired six smaller businesses for a total
cost of $47,229 all of which was paid in cash. The acquisitions
included an orthopedic surgical instrument manufacturer and two
small catheter manufacturers in the Medical Segment; a 55%
controlling interest in a manufacturer of mechanical controls
for the automobile industry in Japan, a European alternative
fuel systems business, and a fabricator of stainless and carbon
steel stranded products in the Commercial Segment. Goodwill
recognized in those transactions amounted to $14,926, all of
which applies to the Medical Segment. Of that amount $8,872 is
expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma income
statement impact of these acquisitions is not material.

investments, the sale of a minor non-core business in its
Medical Segment and the receipt of insurance proceeds related to
a building and inventory that incurred weather related damage.

Note 5 —

Restructuring

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company announced and
commenced implementation of a restructuring and divestiture
program designed to improve future operating performance and
position the Company for earnings growth in the years ahead. The
planned actions include exiting or divesting of non-core or low
performing businesses, consolidating manufacturing operations
and reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses
to share services.

Certain costs associated with the restructuring and divestiture
program are not included in restructuring costs. All inventory
adjustments that resulted from the restructuring and divestiture
program and certain other costs associated with closing out
businesses during the fourth quarter of 2004 are included in
materials, labor and other product costs and totaled $17,040, of
which $4,537, $0 and $12,503 was attributed to the
Company’s Commercial, Medical and Aerospace segments,
respectively.

conjunction with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities.
Asset impairments relate primarily to machinery and equipment
associated with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities as
well as goodwill associated with the Company’s industrial
gas turbine aftermarket services business. Other restructuring
costs include expenses which are directly attributable to the

Shareholders’ equity and stock compensation plans

The authorized capital of the Company is comprised of
100,000,000 common shares, $1 par value, and 500,000
preference shares. No preference shares have been outstanding
during the last three years.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed in the same
manner except that the weighted average number of shares is
increased for dilutive securities. The difference between basic
and diluted weighted average common shares results from the
assumption that dilutive stock options were exercised. A
reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares
outstanding is as follows:

Weighted average stock options (in thousands) of 790, 787 and
260 were antidilutive and therefore not included in the
calculation of earnings per share for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

The Company has stock-based compensation plans that provide for
the granting of incentive and non-qualified options to officers
and key employees to purchase shares of common stock at the
market price of the stock on the dates options are granted.
Outstanding options generally are exercisable three to five
years after the date of the grant and expire no more than ten
years after the grant.

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Significant components of the deferred tax assets and
liabilities at year end were as follows:

At December 26, 2004, the cumulative unremitted earnings of
subsidiaries outside the United States, for which no income or
withholding taxes have been provided, approximated $351,832.
Such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely and as
a result, no deferred tax liability has been recognized with
regard to the remittance of such earnings. It is not practicable
to estimate the income tax liability that might be incurred if
such earnings were remitted to the United States.

Under the tax laws of various jurisdictions in which the Company
operates, deductions or credits that cannot be fully utilized
for tax purposes during the current year may be carried forward,
subject to statutory limitations, to reduce taxable income or
taxes payable in a future year. At December 26, 2004, the
tax effect of such carry forwards approximated $70,884. Of this
amount, $15,907 has no expiration date, $3,328 expires after
2004 but before the end of 2009 and $51,649 expires after 2009.
A substantial amount of these loss carryforwards were acquired
in an acquisition by the Company in 2004. Therefore, the
utilization of these tax attributes is subject to an annual
limitation imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code. It is not expected that this annual limitation will
prevent the Company from utilizing its carryforwards. The
determination of state net operating loss carryforwards are
dependent upon the U.S. subsidiaries’ taxable income
or loss, apportionment percentages and other respective state
laws, which can change year to year and impact the amount of
such carryforward.

The Company has recognized a valuation allowance of $22,743 and
$15,432 for 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to state net
operating loss carryforwards since management has not concluded
that the results of future operations will generate sufficient
taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets related to
those carryforwards.

Pension and other postretirement benefits

The Company has a number of defined benefit pension and
postretirement plans covering eligible U.S. and
non-U.S. employees. The defined benefit pension plans are
noncontributory. The benefits under these plans are based
primarily on years of service and employees’ pay near
retirement. The Company’s funding policy for
U.S. plans is to contribute annually, at a minimum, amounts
required by applicable laws and regulations. Obligations under
non-U.S. plans are systematically provided for by
depositing funds with trustees or by book reserves.

The parent Company and certain subsidiaries provide medical,
dental and life insurance benefits to pensioners and survivors.
The associated plans are unfunded and approved claims are paid
from Company funds.

Increasing the assumed healthcare trend rate by 1% would

would decrease the benefit obligation by $1,551 and would
decrease the 2004 benefit expense by $110.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. and foreign
defined benefit pension plans was $186,302 and $157,222 for 2004
and 2003, respectively.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit
obligation, and fair value of plan assets for U.S. and foreign
plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan
assets were $197,845, $184,514 and $129,441, respectively for
2004 and $170,591, $155,567, and $109,034, respectively for 2003.

The change in the weighted average discount rate on U.S. and
foreign plans from 6.5% to 5.77% for the year ended 2004
resulted in an increase of $23,750 to the defined benefit
obligation for U.S. and foreign plans. This amount is included
in the 2004 actuarial losses in the table above.

Plan assets are allocated among various categories of equities,
fixed income, cash and cash equivalents with professional
investment managers whose performance is actively monitored. The
target allocation among plan assets allows for variances based
on economic and market trends. The primary investment objective
is long-term growth of assets in order to meet present and
future benefit obligations. The Company periodically conducts an
asset/liability modeling study to ensure the investment strategy
is aligned with the profile of benefit obligations.

The plan asset allocations for U.S. and foreign plans are as

Commitments and contingent liabilities

Product warranty liability:

The Company warrants to the
original purchaser of certain of its products that it will, at
its option, repair or replace, without charge, such products if
they fail due to a manufacturing defect. Warranty periods vary
by product. The Company has recourse provisions for certain
products that would enable recovery from third parties for
amounts paid under the warranty. The Company accrues for product
warranties when, based on available information, it is probable
that customers will make claims under warranties relating to
products that have been sold, and a reasonable estimate of the
costs (based on historical claims experience relative to sales)
can be made. Set forth below is a reconciliation of the
Company’s estimated product warranty liability for 2004:

Operating leases:

The Company uses various leased
facilities and equipment in its operations. The terms for these
leased assets vary depending on the lease agreement. The Company
also has synthetic lease programs that are used primarily for
plant and equipment. In connection with the synthetic and other
leases, the Company has residual value guarantees in the amount
of $10,987 at December 26, 2004. The Company’s future
payments cannot exceed the minimum rent obligation plus the
residual value guarantee amount. The guarantee amounts are tied
to the unamortized lease values of the assets under synthetic
lease, and are due should the Company decide neither to renew
these leases, nor to exercise its purchase option. At
December 26, 2004, the Company had no liabilities recorded
for these obligations. Any residual value guarantee amounts paid
to the lessor may be recovered by the Company from the sale of
the assets to a third party.

Net rental expense under operating leases was $47,130, $37,785
and $36,347 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Accounts receivable securitization program:

The Company
uses an accounts receivable securitization program to gain
access to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs. As
currently structured, the Company sells certain trade
receivables on a non-recourse basis to a consolidated company,
which in turn sells an interest in those receivables to a
commercial paper conduit. The conduit issues notes secured by
that interest to third party investors. These notes are secured
by a 364-day liquidity facility provided by a bank. The assets
of the special purpose entity are not available to satisfy the
obligations of the Company. At December 26, 2004, $40,000
was recorded in notes payable under this program.

Environmental:

The Company is subject to contingencies
pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the
future may require the Company to take further action to correct
the effects on the environment of prior disposal practices or
releases of chemical or petroleum substances by the Company or
other parties. Much of this liability results from the
U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act (“CERCLA”), often referred to as
Superfund, the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(“RCRA”) and similar state laws. These laws require
the Company to undertake certain investigative and remedial
activities at sites where the Company conducts or once conducted
operations or at sites where Company-generated waste was
disposed.

Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost
from site to site. These activities, and their associated costs,
depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving
remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and
enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of
potentially responsible parties. At December 26, 2004, the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet included an accrued
liability of $4,338 relating to these matters. Considerable
uncertainty exists with respect to these costs and, under
adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed
the amount accrued as of December 26, 2004. The time-frame
over which the accrued or presently unrecognized amounts may be
paid out, based on past history, is estimated to be
15-20 years.

Litigation:

The Company is a party to various lawsuits
and claims arising in the normal course of business. These
lawsuits and claims include actions involving product liability,
intellectual property, employment and environmental matters.
Based on information currently available, advice of counsel,
available insurance coverage, established reserves and other
resources, the Company does not believe that any such actions
are likely to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
its business, financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity. However, in the event of unexpected further
developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of
these matters, or other similar matters, if unfavorable, may be
materially adverse to the Company’s business, financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity.

In February 2001, Go Medical Industries, Pty, Ltd. and
its owner Dr. Alexander O’Neil filed a trademark
infringement action against the Company’s subsidiary
Rüsch Inc. and Medical Marketing Group, Inc. in the

“reasonable royalty” and an additional $32,200 as
“unjust enrichment.” was rendered against Rüsch
in February 2004. In 2005, the trial judge entered an order
rejecting the jury award against Rüsch. In
February 2005, the plaintiff filed a notice of its intent
to appeal this decision. The Company cannot predict whether the
appeal will be successful or whether any judgment against
Rüsch will be awarded. Accordingly, no accrual has been
recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Other:

The Company has various purchase commitments for
materials, supplies and items of permanent investment incident
to the ordinary conduct of business. In the aggregate, such
commitments are not at prices in excess of current market.

Business segments and other information

The Company has determined that its reportable segments are
Commercial, Medical and Aerospace. This assessment reflects the
aggregation of businesses which have similar products and
services, manufacturing processes, and to a lesser extent,
customers and distribution channels, and is consistent with both
internal management reporting and resource and budgetary
allocations.

The Commercial Segment principally designs, manufactures and
distributes engineered products in the technical areas of driver
control, motion control, power and vehicle management and fluid
management. The Company’s products are used by a wide range
of markets including the passenger and light truck, marine,
recreational, mobile power equipment, military, agricultural and
construction vehicle, truck and bus and various other industrial
equipment sectors.

The Medical Segment businesses develop, manufacture and
distribute disposable medical products, surgical instruments and
medical devices, and specialty devices that support health-care
providers and medical equipment manufacturers. The
Company’s products are largely sold and distributed to
hospitals and health-care providers in a range of clinical
settings.

The Aerospace Segment businesses develop and provide repair
products and services for flight and ground-based turbine
engines, manufacture and distribute precision-machined
components, design, manufacture and market cargo-handling
systems and provide advanced surface treatments to commercial
aviation, military, power generation and industrial markets
worldwide.

Discontinued operations

As part of the restructuring and divestiture program approved by
the Company’s Board of Directors and initiated during the
fourth quarter 2004, the Company adopted a plan to sell its
Tier 1 automotive pedal systems business. The Company is
actively marketing the business and selectively reviewing
alternatives, while it continues to serve its Tier 1
automotive customers and provide appropriate transition. The
Tier 1 automotive pedal systems business is a supplier of
custom engineered power adjustable pedals and electronic
throttle control and standard mechanical pedals. For financial
statement purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of
operations and cash flows of this business have been segregated
from those of continuing operations and are presented in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements as discontinued
operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been reclassified to reflect this presentation.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recognized a loss
of $50,531 based upon a write-down of the automotive pedal
systems business from its carrying value to the estimated fair
value of the business less costs to sell. $44,466 of the
write-down applied to long-lived assets, consisting primarily of
machinery and equipment. The charge is included in operating
loss from discontinued operations.

Revenues of discontinued operations for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were
$133,000, $129,580 and $113,367, respectively. Operating losses
from discontinued operations for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were
$73,028, $9,823 and $1,418, respectively.

Quarterly Data (Unaudited)

(1)

Amounts exclude the impact of the automotive pedal systems
    business, which has been presented in the Company’s
    consolidated financial results as a discontinued operation.

(2)

Amounts include certain reclassifications of previous quarters
    for comparative purposes. See Note 2 for further
    discussion. Minority interest totaled $4,236, $4,900, $4,564 and
    $5,983 for the first, second,

third and fourth quarters of 2004,
    respectively, and totaled $3,789, $4,529, $3,757 and $4,459 for
    the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2003,
    respectively.

(3)

The sum of the quarterly per share
    amounts may not equal per share amounts reported for
    year-to-date periods. This is due to changes in the number of
    weighted average shares outstanding and the effects of rounding
    for each period.
