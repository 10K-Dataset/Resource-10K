PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Teleflex Incorporated is referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our,” “Teleflex” and the “Company.”

THE COMPANY

Teleflex is a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits, improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs. We primarily design, develop, manufacture and supply single-use medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications. We market and sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors. Because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures, we are not dependent upon any one end-market or procedure. We manufacture our products at approximately


manufacturing sites, with major manufacturing operations located in the Czech Republic, Germany, Malaysia, Mexico and the United States (the "U.S.").

We are focused on achieving consistent, sustainable and profitable growth and improving our financial performance by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies through:

•

development of new products and product line extensions;

•

investment in new technologies and broadening the application of our existing technologies;

•

expansion of the use of our products in existing markets and introduction of our products into new geographic markets;

•

achievement of economies of scale as we continue to expand by leveraging our direct sales force and distribution network for new products, as well as by increasing efficiencies in our sales and marketing, research and development structures and manufacturing and distribution facilities; and

•

expansion of our product portfolio through select acquisitions, licensing arrangements and business partnerships that enhance, extend or expedite our development initiatives or our ability to increase our market share.

Our research and development capabilities, commitment to engineering excellence and focus on low-cost manufacturing enable us to bring cost effective, innovative products to market that improve the safety, efficacy and quality of healthcare. Our research and development initiatives focus on developing these products for both existing and new therapeutic applications, as well as enhancements to, and product line extensions of, existing products. During


we introduced several product line extensions and


new products. Our portfolio of existing products and products under development consists primarily of Class I and Class II devices, most of which require 510(k) clearance by the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), for sale in the United States, and some of which are exempt from the requirement to obtain 510(k) clearance. We believe that 510(k) clearance or 510(k)-exempt status reduces our research and development costs and risks, and typically results in a shorter timetable for new product introductions as compared to the premarket approval, or PMA, process that would be required for Class III devices.  See "Government Regulation" below.

HISTORY AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Teleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision mechanical push/pull controls for military aircraft. From this original single market, single product orientation, we expanded and evolved through entries into new businesses, development of new products, introduction of products into new geographic or end-markets and acquisitions and dispositions of businesses. Throughout our history, we have continually focused on providing innovative, technology-driven, specialty-engineered products that help our customers meet their business requirements.

Beginning in 2007, we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses, expanding our presence in the medical device industry, while divesting all of our other businesses, which served the aerospace, automotive, industrial and marine markets. Following the divestitures of our marine business and cargo container and systems businesses in 2011, we became exclusively a medical device company.

We expect to continue to increase the size of our business through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth initiatives.


Recent acquisitions

On February 17, 2017, we acquired Vascular Solutions, Inc. ("Vascular Solutions"), a medical device company that has developed and marketed products for use in minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures.  The aggregate consideration that we paid to acquire Vascular Solutions was $975.5 million. Effective in the fourth quarter 2017, Vascular Solutions financial information is primarily presented within the "Interventional North America" reportable operating segment.  See "Our Segments" below.

On October 2, 2017, we acquired NeoTract, Inc. ("NeoTract"), a medical device company that has developed and commercialized the UroLift System, a minimally invasive medical device for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH.  The estimated fair value of the consideration transferred to acquire NeoTract was

$975.2 million

, which included initial payments of $725.6 million in cash less a favorable working capital adjustment of $1.4 million (for which we had not yet received payment as of December 31, 2017) and $251.0 million in estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The contingent consideration liability represents the estimated fair value of up to $375 million we would be required to pay if specified net sales goals through the end of 2020 are achieved. In connection with this acquisition, we created a new operating segment entitled Interventional Urology North America, which is included within the "all other" category in the presentation of segment information.

See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Distributor-to-direct sales conversions and restructuring programs

During the past several years, we have completed a number of "distributor to direct" sales conversions in several countries.  These transactions generally involve the elimination of a distributor from the sales channel, either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distribution relationship.  In some instances, particularly in Asia, the conversion involves the acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through third party sub-distributors or through new distributors. In 2017, certain European countries were converted from distributor sales to direct sales in connection with our elimination of former Vascular Solutions' distributors.  Also during 2017, we commenced a distributor to direct sales conversion in China as a result of our decision to eliminate a key distributor within that sales channel.  See Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Segment Results - Comparison of 2017 and 2016 - Asia" for further information regarding this initiative.  The distributor to direct sales conversions generally enable us to obtain improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel.  Additionally, we continue to execute restructuring programs to improve efficiencies in our sales and marketing and research and development organizations and in our manufacturing and distribution facilities.

OUR SEGMENTS

Following our acquisition of Vascular Solutions, we commenced an integration program under which we are combining the Vascular Solutions business with certain of our legacy businesses.  Specifically, we are combining Vascular Solutions North American business with our interventional access business, which formerly was part of the Vascular North America operating segment, and our cardiac business, which formerly was a separate operating segment included in the "all other" category for purposes of segment reporting.  These businesses are now in our Interventional North America segment.  Additionally, we are combining the Vascular Solutions businesses in Europe, Asia and Latin America with our legacy businesses in the respective locations, and these Vascular Solutions businesses are now part of our EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), Asia and Latin America operating segments, respectively. The changes in our operating segments, which became effective in the fourth quarter 2017, also reflect the manner in which our new chief operating decision maker assesses business performance and allocation of resources.

As a result of the operating segment changes described above, we have the following seven reportable segments: Vascular North America, Interventional North America, Anesthesia North America, Surgical North America, EMEA, Asia and OEM. In connection with the presentation of segment information, we will continue to present certain operating segments, which now include Interventional Urology North America and Respiratory North America as well as Latin America, in the “all other” category because they are not material. All prior comparative periods presented in this report have been restated to reflect these changes

.

Vascular North America:

Our Vascular North America segment is comprised of our North American vascular access business, which offers products that facilitate a variety of critical care therapies and other applications.  These products primarily consist of our Arrow branded catheters and related devices, including catheter positioning systems, that are used in a wide range of procedures, including the administration of intravenous medications and other therapies, the measurement of blood pressure and the withdrawal of blood samples through a single puncture site.  The product portfolio principally consists of the following products:

•

Arrow Central Venous Catheters (CVCs): Arrow CVCs are inserted in the neck or shoulder area and come in multiple lengths with up to five channels, or lumens. The Arrow CVC has a pressure injectable option which gives clinicians who perform contrast-enhanced CT scans the ability to use an indwelling (in the body) pressure injectable Arrow CVC to inject contrast dye for the scan without having to insert a second catheter.

•

Arrow EZ-IO Intraosseous Vascular Access System: The Arrow EZ-IO system provides vascular access for the delivery of medications and fluids via intraosseous, or in the bone, infusion when traditional vascular access is difficult or impossible. Sales of the Arrow EZ-IO system to our hospital customers are included in our Vascular North America segment results.  As discussed below, sales of the Arrow EZ-IO to pre-hospital care customers, such as emergency medical service providers, are included in our Anesthesia North America segment results.

•

Arrow Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICCs): Arrow PICCs are soft, flexible catheters that are inserted in the upper arm and advanced into a vein that carries blood to the heart to administer various types of intravenous medications and therapies. Arrow PICCs have a pressure injectable option that can withstand the higher pressures required by the injection of contrast media for CT scans.

•

Arrow Jugular Axillo-subclavian Central Catheters (JACCs): Arrow JACCs are designed to be inserted in the neck or shoulder area and provide an alternative to traditional CVCs and PICCs for acute care.  Arrow JACCs may be used for short or long term periods to treat patients who may have poor peripheral circulation.

•

Arrow Midline Catheters (Midlines): Arrow Midlines are made of medical grade, flexible polyurethane material and are inserted in the upper arm.  Midlines are appropriate when patients face difficult intravenous catheter insertions or therapy will last no longer than one to four weeks.

•

Arrow  Catheter Tip Positioning Systems:  We offer two distinct catheter tip positioning systems that are designed to facilitate precise placement of catheters within the heart.  The first is our VPS G4 Vascular Positioning System, which is an advanced vascular positioning system designed to facilitate precise placement of CVCs within the heart. Indicated as an alternative to chest x-ray confirmation for CVC tip placement confirmation in adult patients, the VPS G4 analyzes multiple metrics, in real time, to help clinicians navigate through the circulatory system and identify the correct catheter tip placement in the heart.  We also offer the Arrow VPS Rhythm™ System, which provides electrocardiogram (ECG)-based tip confirmation in a highly portable, lightweight and versatile design.  ECG technology facilitates catheter tip placement and confirmation within the superior vena-cava-cavatorial junction in the heart, and can be used with a broad range of catheter types.  When paired with our VPS TipTracker


stylet for insertion of PICCs, the Arrow VPS Rhythm System provides real-time visual navigation by tracing the catheter pathway with a blue line on a color screen.

•

Arrow Arterial Catheterization Sets: Our Arrow arterial catheterization sets facilitate arterial pressure monitoring and blood withdrawal for glucose, blood-gas and electrolyte measurement in a wide variety of critical care and intensive care settings.

•

Arrow Multi-Lumen Access Catheters (MAC): The Arrow MAC combines the access of a sheath introducer with the high-flow lumens of a central line. The MAC's hemostasis valve allows for easy access for additional devices, such as a thermodilution catheter or ARROW MAC Companion Catheter, adding up to three additional lumens.

•

Arrow Percutaneous Sheath Introducers: Our Arrow percutaneous sheath introducers are used to insert cardiovascular and other catheterization devices into the vascular system during critical care procedures.

•

Arrow Endurance Extended Dwell Peripheral Catheter System: The Arrow Endurance enables the provision of continuous intravenous therapy for the entire length of stay. It permits access to the patient’s peripheral vascular system to sample blood, monitor blood pressure, or administer fluids.

The large majority of our CVCs are treated with solutions based on our ARROWg+ard or ARROWg+ard Blue Plus antimicrobial technology, which have been shown to reduce the risk of catheter related bloodstream infection. Our Arrow Chlorag+ard technology, available on our PICCs, JACCs and Midlines, provides antimicrobial and antithrombogenic protection on inner and outer catheter surfaces as well as the entire fluid pathway of the catheter.  It has been shown to be effective in reducing microbial colonization and thrombus accumulation on catheter surfaces.

We also offer many of our vascular access catheters in Maximal Barrier Precautions trays, which are designed to assist healthcare providers in complying with clinical guidelines for reducing catheter-related bloodstream infections. These trays are available for CVCs, PICCs and multi access catheters and include a full body drape, coated or non-coated catheters and other accessories. In addition, our ErgoPACK system offers clinicians a broad range of tray configurations with components packaged in the tray in the order in which they will be needed during the procedure, and incorporates features designed to promote ease of use and patient and provider safety.

Interventional North America:

Our Interventional North America segment is comprised of the North American component of our Vascular Solutions business, which we acquired in February 2017, as well as our interventional access and cardiac care businesses.  Our portfolio consists of products used by interventional cardiologists, interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons and vein practices.

Vascular Solutions product portfolio

Our Vascular Solutions portfolio consists of clinically advanced devices for treating coronary and peripheral vascular disease and includes the following:

•

GuideLiner guide extension catheters:  Our GuideLiner family is  designed to increase guide catheter support and stability to allow deep-seating of the guide catheter for  distal device delivery and selective delivery of contrast. The device can also be utilized in assisting complex cardiac catheter interventions.

•

Micro-introducers: These products are  used to gain percutaneous access to the vasculature for performing arterial and venous catheterization procedures.

•

Turnpike catheters: These catheters may be used to facilitate placement and exchange of guidewires and to deliver diagnostic and therapeutic agents to discrete regions of the coronary and peripheral vasculature.

•

Trapliner: In 2017, we launched the TrapLiner catheter, which is intended for use in conjunction with guide catheters to access discrete regions of the coronary and/or peripheral vasculature, to facilitate placement of interventional devices and to facilitate the exchange of interventional devices while maintaining the position of the guidewire within the vasculature.  The TrapLiner catheter is similar in design to the GuideLiner guide extension catheter, with the added feature of an integrated balloon for trapping a standard 0.014” guidewire within a guide catheter. The TrapLiner catheter can be used as an alternative method to the trapping technique that requires the use of a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) balloon to exchange an existing over-the-wire catheter while maintaining guidewire position. The technique of guidewire trapping for catheter exchange is most commonly performed in complex interventional procedures.


•

TwinPass Torque: In 2017, we launched the TwinPass Torque, which is designed for procedures that call for the delivery of two interventional guidewires from a single catheter in clinical situations where catheter delivery and turning control are important.

•

Spectre Guidewire: Designed for premium guidewire performance in coronary and peripheral interventions, the Spectre Guideware provides enhanced trackability and torque control.

Interventional access product portfolio

Our interventional access products are used in a wide range of applications, including dialysis, oncology and critical care therapies. Our interventional access portfolio also includes Arrow branded products, such as diagnostic and drainage kits, embolectomy balloons, and reinforced percutaneous sheath introducers. Our interventional access products include the following:

•

Arrow OnControl Powered Bone Marrow / Bone Access System:  The Arrow OnControl powered bone access system is used to obtain bone marrow samples, bone aspirate and access bone lesions for hematology and in ontological diagnostic procedures.

•

Arrow Trerotola Percutaneous Thrombectomy Device ("PTD"):  The Arrow Trerotola PTD is used for declotting of dialysis grafts and fistulas, respectively indirect and direct connections between an artery and a vein for hemodialysis access.

•

Arrow Chronic Hemodialysis Catheters:  The Arrow chronic hemodialysis catheters include both antegrade and retrograde insertion options for split, step and symmetrical tip configurations.

•

ARROW-Clark VectorFlow Hemodialysis Catheter:  The Arrow-Clark VectorFlow catheter is a symmetrical tip tunneled hemodialysis catheter designed to reduce loss of lock solution (which is used on catheters to reduce the risk of thrombosis), give sustained high flows and reduce the risk of thrombus accumulation due to platelet activation. Additionally, the specially designed catheter tip allows for placement flexibility with minimal impact on recirculation.

•

Arrow Polysite Low Profile Hybrid Ports:  The Arrow Polysite Low Profile Hybrid Port is used for long-term access to the central venous system and to facilitate repeated vascular access.  It is available in multiple standard French sizes. The hybrid design provides a strong titanium reservoir and lightweight plastic body delivering the strength and the comfort needed for long-term treatment in patients of all sizes.

Cardiac care product portfolio

Products in the cardiac care portfolio include diagnostic catheters, intra-aortic balloon catheters and capital equipment. Diagnostic catheters include thermodilution and wedge pressure catheters. Our Berman and Reverse Berman catheters are used during the x-ray examination of blood vessels  and our temporary pacing catheters are often used in common interventional procedures such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR.  We also manufacture sheaths for femoral and trans-radial aortic access used in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.  Our capital equipment offering includes our intra-aortic balloon pump, or IABP.  When combined with our intra aortic balloon catheter, our intra aortic balloon pumps are used to augment oxygen delivery to the cardiac muscle and reduce the oxygen demand after cardiac surgery, heart attack or interventional procedures. We recently launched the Autocat 3 Optimus, our third generation intra-aortic balloon pump. This device helps a weakened heart pump blood and can deliver IABP therapy to a broad range of patients, even those not previously considered candidates for IABP therapy. Clinicians may use the Autocat 3 Optimus on patients with the most severe arrhythmias or heart rates as high as 200 beats per minute.

Anesthesia North America:

Our Anesthesia North America segment is comprised of our North American pain management and airway management products and other products that, like our airway management products, provide pre-hospital emergency applications

.

The LMA Gastro Airway, our latest airway management device, is the first single-use laryngeal mask with a gastric channel.  Designed for use in upper endoscopy procedures, this device offers an increased level of airway management for clinicians. The LMA Gastro Airway also includes our Cuff Pilot™ technology, which enables clinicians to confirm that the inserted cuff is properly inflated and to monitor pressure levels.

•

LMA Atomization:  Our LMA atomization portfolio includes products designed to facilitate atomized delivery of certain medications. Included in the portfolio is our LMA MAD Nasal, an intranasal mucosal atomization device that is designed to provide a safe and painless way to deliver medications approved for intranasal delivery to a patient's blood stream without an intravenous line or needle.

•

RUSCH Endotracheal Tubes and Laryngoscopes:  We offer a broad portfolio of products to facilitate and support endotracheal intubation to administer oxygen, and anesthetic gases in multiple settings (surgery, critical care and emergency settings). We also provide a broad range of products for laryngoscopy, a procedure that is primarily used to obtain a view of the airway to facilitate tracheal intubation during general anesthesia or cardiopulmonary resuscitation ("CPR").  Among these products is the Rusch DispoLED™ Laryngoscope Handle and Green Rusch Lite Blade, a single-use system designed to help facilities comply with standards designed to reduce the potential for patient cross-contamination associated with reusable devices during intubation.

Pre-hospital emergency products

As noted above, our airway management products can be used in pre-hospital emergency settings.  We offer other products designed for use in pre-hospital emergency settings, including the Arrow EZ-IO System, which is described in the Vascular North America segment summary above.  The EZ-IO System offers a method for vascular access that can be administered quickly and effectively in emergency situations.

We offer an extensive portfolio of integrated capabilities, including engineering, material selection, regulatory affairs, prototyping, testing and validation, manufacturing, assembly and packing.

Other businesses:

Our other operating segments do not meet the threshold for separate disclosure under applicable accounting guidance and are therefore included in the “all other” line item in tabular presentations of segment information. Products offered by these operating segments include single-use respiratory, urology and interventional urology products.  We also have an operating segment encompassing our Latin American business.

Respiratory/urology North America

In 2015, we combined our respiratory and urology businesses. Our respiratory products are used in a variety of care settings and include oxygen therapy products, aerosol therapy products, spirometry products, and ventilation management products. Our Hudson RCI brand has been a prominent name in respiratory care for over 65 years.

Our urology product portfolio provides bladder management for patients in the hospital and individuals in the home care markets. The product portfolio consists principally of a wide range of catheters (including Foley, intermittent, external and suprapubic), urine collectors, catheterization accessories and products for operative endourology marketed under the Rusch brand name.

Interventional urology North America

As a result of our acquisition of NeoTract in 2017, we now offer the UroLift System, a minimally invasive technology for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. The UroLift System involves the placement of permanent implants, typically through a transurethral outpatient procedure, that hold the prostate lobes apart to relieve compression on the urethra without cutting, heating or removing prostate tissue.


Latin America

Our Latin America business generally engages in the same type of operations, and serves the same type of end markets, as the EMEA and Asia segments.

OUR MARKETS

We generally serve three end-markets: hospitals and healthcare providers, medical device manufacturers and home care. These markets are affected by a number of factors, including demographics, utilization and reimbursement patterns. The following charts depict the percentage of net revenues for the years ended

,


and


derived from each of our end markets.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

We are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the U.S. relating to the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of our products.

Regulation of Medical Devices in the United States

All of our medical devices manufactured or sold in the United States are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”), and its implementing regulations, which are enforced by the FDA. The FDA and, in some cases, other government agencies administer requirements for the design, testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record keeping, clearance, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-market surveillance, import and export of our medical devices.

Unless an exemption or pre-amendment grandfather status applies, each medical device that we market must first receive either clearance as a Class I or Class II device (by submitting a premarket notification (“510(k)”) or approval as a Class III device (by filing a premarket approval application (“PMA”)) from the FDA pursuant to the FDC Act. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed 510(k)-cleared device (or pre-amendment device for which FDA has not called for PMAs), referred to as the "predicate device." Substantial equivalence is established by the applicant showing that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics or has been shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device.  The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months, but it can last longer. A device that is not eligible for the 510(k) process because there is no predicate device may be reviewed through the de novo process (the process for approval when no substantially equivalent device exists) if the FDA agrees it is a low to moderate risk device. A device not eligible for 510(k) clearance or de novo clearance is categorized as Class III and must follow the PMA approval pathway, which requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction.  The process of obtaining PMA approval is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) process. It generally takes from one to three years or even longer. Our portfolio of existing products and pipeline of potential new products consist primarily of Class I and Class II devices that require 510(k) clearance, although a few are 510(k) exempt.  In addition, modifications made to devices after they receive clearance


or approval may require a new 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA or PMA supplement. We cannot be sure that 510(k) clearance or PMA approval will be obtained in a timely matter if at all for any device that we propose to market.

A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance.  The sponsor of a clinical study must comply with and conduct the study in accordance with the applicable federal regulations, including FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”) requirements, and good clinical practice (“GCP”).  Clinical trials must also be approved by an institutional review board ("IRB"), which is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review biomedical research involving human subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of the human research subject.  The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients.  An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.

A device placed on the market must comply with numerous regulatory requirements. Those regulatory requirements include the following:

•

device listing and establishment registration;

•

adherence to the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) which requires stringent design, testing, control, documentation, complaint handling and other quality assurance procedures;

•

labeling requirements;

•

FDA prohibitions against the promotion of off-label uses or indications;

•

adverse event and malfunction reporting;

•

post-approval restrictions or conditions, potentially including post-approval clinical trials or other required testing;

•

post-market surveillance requirements;

•

the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can require or ask for the recall of products from the market; and

•

voluntary corrections or removals reporting and documentation.

The FDA has issued final regulations regarding the Unique Device Identification (“UDI”) System, which requires manufacturers to mark certain medical devices with unique identifiers. While the FDA expects that the UDI System will help track products during recalls and improve patient safety, it has required us to make changes to our manufacturing and labeling, which could increase our costs.  The UDI System is being implemented in stages based on device risk, with the first requirements having taken effect in September 2014 and the last taking effect in September 2020.

Certain of our medical devices are sold in convenience kits that include a drug component, such as lidocaine.  These types of kits are generally regulated as combination products within the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (or "CDRH") under the device regulations because the device provides the primary mode of action of the kit.  Although the kit as a whole is regulated as a medical device, it may be subject to certain drug requirements such as current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”) to the extent applicable to the drug-component repackaging activities and subject to inspection to verify compliance with cGMPs as well as other regulatory requirements.

Our manufacturing facilities, as well as those of certain of our suppliers, are subject to periodic and for-cause inspections to verify compliance with the QSR as well as other regulatory requirements. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from issuance of a warning or untitled letter to more severe sanctions, such as product recalls or seizures, civil penalties, consent decrees, injunctions, criminal prosecution, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusal to permit importation or exportation, refusal to grant, or delays in granting, clearances or approvals or withdrawal or suspension of existing clearances or approvals. The FDA also has the authority under certain circumstances to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us.  Any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business.


Regulation of Medical Devices Outside of the United States

Medical device laws also are in effect in many of the markets outside of the United States in which we do business. These laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our products to requests for product data or certifications. Inspection of and controls over manufacturing, as well as monitoring of device-related adverse events, are components of most of these regulatory systems.

Healthcare Laws

We are subject to various federal, state and local laws in the United States targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry.  These laws prohibit us from, among other things, soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration to induce the referral or use of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally or state financed healthcare programs.  Violations of these laws are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.  In addition, we are subject to federal and state false claims laws in the United States that prohibit the submission of false payment claims under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally or state funded programs.  Certain marketing practices, such as off-label promotion, and violations of federal anti-kickback laws may also constitute violations of these laws.

We are also subject to various federal and state reporting and disclosure requirements related to the healthcare industry.  Rules issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") require us to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data is available to the public on the CMS website. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.  In addition, several states now require medical device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of device products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states.  Other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities.  The federal government and certain other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance and/or reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations.

Other Regulatory Requirements

We are also subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws applicable in jurisdictions outside the United State that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from improperly offering or paying anything of value to non-United States government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, most of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with government entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. In the sale, delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the United States, we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations, including those administered by the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries and/or with certain individuals identified by the United States government. Despite our global trade and compliance program, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, distributors or other agents. Violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines and imprisonment.

COMPETITION

The medical device industry is highly competitive. We compete with many companies, ranging from small start-up enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than us and have access to significantly greater financial resources. Furthermore, extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances characterize the market in which we compete. We must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies for our businesses to remain competitive. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit, product reliability, performance, customer and sales support, and cost-effectiveness. Our major competitors include Medtronic plc and Becton, Dickinson and Company.


SALES AND MARKETING

Our product sales are made directly to hospitals, healthcare providers, distributors and to original equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales forces, independent representatives and independent distributor networks.

BACKLOG

Most of our products are sold to hospitals or healthcare providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or weeks, with longer order times for products sold to medical device manufacturers. Therefore, our backlog of orders is not indicative of revenues to be anticipated in any future 12-month period.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We own a portfolio of patents, patents pending and trademarks. We also license various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods based upon the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks. All product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to, us or our subsidiaries. Although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future, we do not consider any single patent or trademark, except for the Teleflex and Arrow brands, to be essential to the operation of our business.

SUPPLIERS AND MATERIALS

Materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations. We are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied for our overall operations. Most of the materials and components we use are available from multiple sources, and where practical, we attempt to identify alternative suppliers. Volatility in commodity prices, particularly with respect to aluminum, steel and plastic resins, can have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of our products. We may not be able to successfully pass cost increases through to all of our customers, particularly original equipment manufacturers.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

We are engaged in both internal and external research and development. Our research and development costs principally relate to our efforts to bring innovative new products to the markets we serve, and our efforts to enhance the clinical value, ease of use, safety and reliability of our existing product lines. Our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide safe and effective products that reduce infections, improve patient and clinician safety, enhance patient outcomes and enable less invasive procedures. Our research and development expenditures were

$84.8 million

,

$58.6 million

and

$52.1 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


, respectively.

We also acquire or license products and technologies that are consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability to provide a full range of product and service options to our customers.

SEASONALITY

Portions of our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to single-use products.  Historically, we have experienced higher sales in the fourth quarter as a result of these factors.

EMPLOYEES

We employed approximately

14,400

full-time and temporary employees at

December 31, 2017

. Of these employees, approximately

3,600

were employed in the United States and

10,800

in countries other than the United States. Approximately

10%

of our employees in the United States and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collective-bargaining arrangements. We believe we have good relationships with our employees.


ENVIRONMENTAL

We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the United States. Our operations, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. While we continue to make capital and operational expenditures relating to compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, we cannot ensure that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection, health and safety laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities.

INVESTOR INFORMATION

We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Therefore, we file reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the following factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. The risks below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.

We face strong competition. Our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our business.

The medical device industry is highly competitive. We compete with many domestic and foreign medical device companies ranging from small start-up enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment, to companies that are larger and more established than us, have a broad range of competitive products, participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do.

In addition, the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances. The future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products. Our product development efforts may require us to make substantial investments. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop new products, enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of our products, due to, among other things, our inability to:

•

identify viable new products;


•

maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our investments in research and development and product acquisitions;

•

obtain adequate intellectual property protection;

•

gain market acceptance of new products; or

•

successfully obtain regulatory approvals.

In addition, our competitors currently may be developing, or may develop in the future, products that provide better features, clinical outcomes or economic value than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop. Our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our customers depend on third party coverage and reimbursements, and the failure of healthcare programs to provide sufficient coverage and reimbursement for our medical products could adversely affect us.

The ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products is important to our business. Demand for many of our existing and new medical products is, and will continue to be, affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do business. Even when we develop or acquire a promising new product, demand for the product may be limited unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and government third party payors. Internationally, healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly. In some countries, medical centers are constrained by fixed budgets, regardless of the volume and nature of patient treatment. Other countries require application for, and approval of, government or third party reimbursement. Without both favorable coverage determinations by, and the financial support of, government and third party insurers, the market for many of our medical products would be adversely affected. In this regard, we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products. Adverse coverage determinations, including reductions in the amount of reimbursement, could harm our business by discouraging customers’ selection of our products and reducing the prices they are willing to pay.

In addition, as a result of their purchasing power, third party payors are implementing cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts, price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursement for medical technologies and procedures. These trends could compel us to reduce prices for our products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions, and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring, facility consolidations, realignment, cost reduction and other strategic initiatives.

Over the past several years we have implemented a number of restructuring, realignment and cost reduction initiatives, including facility consolidations, organizational realignments and reductions in our workforce, and we may engage in similar efforts in the future. While we have realized some efficiencies from these initiatives, we may not realize the benefits of these or future initiatives to the extent we anticipated. Further, such benefits may be realized later than expected, and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated, which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions. In addition, if these measures are not successful or sustainable, we may be compelled to undertake additional restructuring, realignment and cost reduction efforts, which could result in significant additional charges. Moreover, if our restructuring, realignment and cost reduction efforts prove ineffective, our ability to achieve our other strategic and business plan goals may be adversely affected.

In addition, as part of our efforts to increase operating efficiencies, we have implemented a number of initiatives over the past several years to consolidate our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, systems.  To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our business or operations in connection with these initiatives.  However, as we continue our efforts to further consolidate our ERP systems, we could experience business disruptions, which could adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention of management away from daily operations. In addition, any delays in the implementation of these initiatives could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs. Should we experience such difficulties, our business, cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected.


A significant portion of our United States revenues is derived from sales to distributors, and “destocking” activity by these distributors can adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.

A significant portion of our revenues in the United States is derived from sales to distributors, who, in turn, sell our products to hospitals and other health care institutions.  From time to time, these distributors may decide to reduce their levels of inventory with regard to certain of our products, a practice we refer to as “destocking.”  A distributor's decision to reduce inventory levels with respect to our products may be based on a number of factors, such as distributor expectations regarding demand for a particular product, distributor buying decisions (including decisions to purchase competing products), changes in distributor policies regarding the maintenance of inventory levels, economic conditions and other factors.  For example, during the third quarter of 2016, we experienced a decline in purchases by our United States distributors that adversely affected our revenues and results of operations. We believe the reduction resulted from the distributors' expectations of a less severe 2016-2017 flu season, which resulted in reduced levels of purchasing with respect to certain of our products that are used for treatment of hospitalized patients suffering from the flu.  Following such instances of reduced purchases, distributors may revert to previous purchasing levels; nevertheless, we cannot assure that distributors will, in fact, increase purchases of our products in this manner.  A decline in the level of product purchases by our United States distributors in the future could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations during a reporting period, and an extended decline in such product purchases could have a longer term material adverse effect.

We are subject to extensive government regulation, which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance. Our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by the FDA and by comparable government agencies in other countries. The regulations govern, among other things, the development, design, approval, manufacturing, labeling, importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products. Moreover, these regulations are subject to future change.

In the United States, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, or claim for, or significant modification to, an existing product, we generally must first receive either 510(k) or de novo clearance or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA, from the FDA. Similarly, most major markets for medical devices outside the United States also require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign government authorities, can be costly and time consuming, and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, once a device has been cleared or approved, a new clearance or approval may be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed. Furthermore, the FDA or a foreign government authority may make its review and clearance or approval process more rigorous, which could require us to generate additional clinical or other data, and expend more time and effort, in obtaining future product clearances or approvals. The regulatory clearance and approval process may result in, among other things, delayed realization of product revenues, substantial additional costs or limitations on indicated uses of products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance, such product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or issues relating to its application.

Failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to adverse effects on our business, which could include:

•

partial suspension or total shutdown of manufacturing;

•

product shortages;

•

delays in product manufacturing;

•

warning or untitled letters;

•

fines or civil penalties;

•

delays in obtaining new regulatory clearances or approvals;

•

withdrawal or suspension of required clearances, approvals or licenses;

•

product seizures or recalls;

•

injunctions;

•

criminal prosecution;


•

advisories or other field actions;

•

operating restrictions; and

•

prohibitions against exporting of products to, or importing products from, countries outside the United States.

We could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines. In addition, civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion under Medicaid or Medicare, could result from regulatory violations. Any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and performance claims must be adequately substantiated. Promoting a device for an off-label use or making misleading or unsubstantiated claims could result in government enforcement action.

Furthermore, our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other federal, state and foreign government authorities, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, which requires periodic audits, design controls, quality control testing and documentation procedures, as well as complaint evaluations and investigation. In addition, any facilities assembling convenience kits that include drug components and are registered as drug repackaging establishments are also subject to current good manufacturing practices requirements for drugs. The FDA also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and product malfunctions and may require the reporting of recalls or other field safety corrective actions. Issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in FDA enforcement action through any of the actions discussed above. Moreover, issues identified through such inspections and reports may require significant resources to resolve.

We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws, regulation and enforcement; our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the governments of those states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

•

the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute, which, among other things, prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully offering or paying remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, or soliciting payment for such referrals, purchases, orders and recommendations;

•

federal false claims laws which, among other things, prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from the federal government, including Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors;

•

the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which prohibits schemes to defraud any healthcare benefit program and false statements relating to healthcare matters; and

•

state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other government regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment of personnel, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found to have violated these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations.

Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), imposed annual reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals. The reported information is made publicly available in a searchable format. In addition, device manufacturers are required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for each payment, transfer


of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”).

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to healthcare providers. Some states, such as California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts, mandate implementation of compliance programs that include the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation for consulting and other services, and other remuneration to healthcare providers. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance and/or reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may inadvertently violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations.

We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims, as well as product recalls, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our reputation as a medical device company may be damaged if one or more of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective.

Our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of our products. In particular, our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings for procedures involving seriously ill patients. In addition, many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time. Product defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks with respect to products we manufacture or sell could result in patient injury or death. In addition, in connection with the divestitures of our former non-medical businesses, we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to those businesses, which include, among other things, liability for products manufactured prior to the date on which we completed the sale of the business.  Product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive damages. The magnitude of potential losses from product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time, and the related legal defense costs may be significant. We could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims.

In addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may voluntarily participate, or be required by regulatory authorities to participate, in a recall of that product. In the event of a recall, we may lose sales and be exposed to individual or class-action litigation claims. Moreover, negative publicity regarding a quality or safety issue, whether accurate or inaccurate, could harm our reputation, decrease demand for our products, lead to product withdrawals or impair our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the future. Product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets,

combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

We are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions.  The economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets that occurred in recent years led to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending, resulting in reductions, delays or cancellations of purchases of our products and services.  Despite some improvements in recent years, economic conditions continue to cause disruption in some financial markets, resulting in, among other things, diminished liquidity and credit availability. We cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more typical spending behaviors. The continuation of the present broadly applicable economic trends of weak economic growth, constricted credit, public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility, particularly with respect to the euro, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Additionally, our customers, particularly in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided, which has increased our focus on collectability with respect to our accounts receivable from these customers. To date, we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers, and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our foreseeable additional operating needs. However, the ongoing uncertainty in the European financial markets, combined with a continuation of constrained European credit markets creates a risk that some of our European customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, our aggregate net current and long term trade accounts receivable in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece were

$49.1 million

and

$51.1 million

, respectively. In


,


and



, net revenues from these countries were approximately

6%

,

7%

and

7%

of total net revenues, respectively, and average days that accounts receivable from these countries were outstanding were


,


and


days, respectively. Although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments, we cannot assure that the loss rate will not increase in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy. If our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible, we would be required to incur additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations.

In addition, adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future impairment charges with respect to our goodwill and other intangible assets, which would not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.

Our strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income and may have material impacts on our operating results.

Our strategic initiatives include making significant investments designed to achieve revenue growth and to enable us to meet or exceed margin improvement targets. If we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives, we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected.

In addition, as part of our strategy for growth, we have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements. However, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully, and our joint ventures or strategic alliances may not prove to be successful. In this regard, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations, technologies, services and products and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. Moreover, the products and technologies that we acquire may not be successful or may require us to devote significantly greater development, marketing and other resources, as well as significantly greater investments, than we anticipated. We could also experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets, asset impairment charges and other matters that could arise in connection with the acquisition of a company or business, including matters related to internal control over financial reporting and regulatory compliance, as well as the short-term effects of increased costs on results of operations.  Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no assurance that we will identify all such risks or the magnitude of the risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and expenditures. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. There can be no assurance that difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In connection with certain of our completed acquisitions, we have agreed to pay consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives, such as receipt of regulatory approval, commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets.  As of the acquisition date, we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay.  As of

December 31, 2017

, we accrued

$272.1 million

of contingent consideration, of which, the vast majority related to our acquisition of NeoTract.  On a quarterly basis, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings, which could have a material impact

on our results of operations.   In addition, actual payments may differ materially from the amount of the contingent liability we have recorded, which could have a material impact on our cash flows  and liquidity.  For information regarding assumptions related to our contingent consideration liabilities, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  For additional information regarding our acquisitions, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Health care reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business.

Political, economic and regulatory developments have effected fundamental changes in the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act substantially changed the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers. It also encourages improvements in the quality of health care products and services and significantly impacts the United States pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act:


•

established a 2.3% excise tax on sales of medical devices with respect to any entity that manufactures or imports specified medical devices offered for sale in the United States, although this tax was suspended for 2016 and 2017 as a result of the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 and has been further suspended for 2018 and 2019 as a result of the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018;

•

established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research;

•

implemented payment system reforms, including a national pilot program to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain health care services through bundled payment models; and

•

created an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate.

In


, we recorded an expense of

$10.2 million

with respect to the medical device excise tax. While, as noted above, the excise tax has been suspended through 2019,we will again be subject to the excise tax in 2020 unless the suspension is extended further. We cannot predict at this time the full impact of the Affordable Care Act or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In this regard, several legislative initiatives to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act were proposed, but not adopted in 2017.  However, the recently adopted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the individual mandate under the Affordable Care Act, which has resulted in increased uncertainty regarding insurance premium prices for participants in insurance exchanges under the act, and may have other effects. The longer-term viability of, or the nature of any modification of, or legislative substitution for, the Affordable Care Act is highly uncertain, and we cannot predict the effect that any of these events would have on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We are subject to risks associated with our non-United States operations.

We have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities, research and development facilities, sales personnel and customer support operations in a number of countries outside the United States, including Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Malaysia and Mexico. In addition, a significant portion of our non-United States revenues are derived from sales to third party distributors.  As of

December 31, 2017

,

75%

of our full-time and temporary employees were employed in countries outside of the United States, and approximately

45%

of our net property, plant and equipment was located outside the United States. In addition, for the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


approximately

42%

,

46%

and

47%

, respectively, of our net revenues (based on the Teleflex entity generating the sale) were derived from operations outside the United States.

Our international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the United States, including:

•

exchange controls, currency restrictions and fluctuations in currency values;

•

trade protection measures;

•

potentially costly and burdensome import or export requirements;

•

laws and business practices that favor local companies;

•

changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and procedures;

•

subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that currently are or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we have operations;

•

substantial foreign tax liabilities, including potentially negative consequences resulting from changes in tax laws;

•

restrictions and taxes related to the repatriation of foreign earnings;

•

differing labor regulations;

•

additional United States and foreign government controls or regulations;

•

difficulties in the protection of intellectual property; and

•

unsettled political and economic conditions and possible terrorist attacks against American interests.

In addition, the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-United States jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper


payments to non-United States officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded United States corporations and their foreign affiliates, which, among other things, are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments to government officials, and to prevent the establishment of “off the books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored health care systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with government entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. However, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree.  Despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures, we may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees, distributors or other agents.  In addition, we may be exposed to liability due to pre-acquisition conduct of employees, distributors or other agents of businesses or operations we acquire. Violations of anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We also could be subject to severe penalties and other adverse consequences, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, substantial expenditures related to further enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes and other remedial actions, as well as harm to our reputation.

Furthermore, we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the United States, including the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of the Treasury, as well as other laws and regulations administered by the Department of Commerce. These regulations limit our ability to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons. While we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations, we cannot assure that a violation will not occur, whether knowingly or inadvertently. Failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the disgorgement of profits, the imposition of a court-appointed monitor, the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in United States government contracts, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. Products manufactured in, and sold into, foreign markets represent a significant portion of our operations. Our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in non-United States currencies to United States dollars, our reporting currency, as well as the foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities and from transactions denominated in currencies other than the primary currency of the country in which the entity operates, which we refer to as "non-functional currencies." A strengthening or weakening of the United States dollar in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which we sell or manufacture our products, such as the euro, will affect our United States dollar-reported revenue and income. Although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of our monetary assets and liabilities and projected cash flows denominated in non-functional currencies in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations, changes in the relative values of currencies may, in some instances, have a significant effect on our results of operations.

Many of our products have significant plastic resin content. We also use quantities of other commodities, such as aluminum and steel. Increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services. We may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers, particularly with respect to those products we sell under group purchase agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

Increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers, thereby adversely affecting their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need.  In addition, our borrowing costs could be adversely affected if interest rates increase.  Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.


Fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect us.

As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate may, however, differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country and changes in tax laws (including the impact of recently enacted United States tax legislation as discussed immediately below). Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was enacted on December 22, 2017.  The TCJA permanently reduces the United States corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21%; puts into effect a territorial tax system, generally providing for, among other things, a dividends received deduction on the foreign source portion of dividends received from a foreign corporation if specified conditions are met; imposes a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed post-1986 earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, which are deemed repatriated for purposes of the tax; and creates, modifies or repeals many other statutory and regulatory provisions. Our consolidated financial statements as of, and for the year ended December 31, 2017, include provisional amounts with respect to the deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.  While we believe that the provisional amounts constitute reasonable estimates, we continue to examine the impact the TCJA may have on our business.   Once our accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA is complete, the amounts with respect to the income tax effects of the TCJA may differ from the provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the TCJA.

An interruption in our manufacturing or distribution operations or our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business.

Many of our key products are manufactured at or distributed from single locations, and the availability of alternate facilities is limited. If operations at one or more of our facilities is suspended due to natural disasters or other events, we may not be able to timely manufacture or distribute one or more of our products at previous levels or at all. Furthermore, our ability to establish replacement facilities or to substitute suppliers may be delayed due to regulations and requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products. In addition, in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers, we may not be able to timely manufacture or supply the affected products at previous levels or at all. The manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems in the manufacturing process, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, defective raw materials and environmental factors, could lead to launch delays, product shortages, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues.  A reduction or interruption in manufacturing or distribution, or our inability to secure suitable alternative sources of raw materials or components, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our ability to attract, train, develop and retain key employees is important to our success.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to retain our key personnel, including our executive officers and other members of our senior management team. Our success also depends, in part, on our ability to attract, train, develop and retain other key employees, including research and development, sales, marketing and operations personnel. We may experience difficulties in retaining executives and other employees due to many factors, including:

•

the intense competition for skilled personnel in our industry;

•

fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions;

•

changes in our organizational structure;

•

our restructuring initiatives;

•

competitors’ hiring practices; and

•

the effectiveness of our compensation programs.


Our inability to attract, train, develop and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We depend upon relationships with physicians and other health care professionals.

We depend on our ability to maintain strong working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals in connection with research and development for some of our products. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and advice regarding the development and use of these products. Physicians assist us as researchers, product consultants, inventors and public speakers. If we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and, as a result, no longer have the benefit of their knowledge and advice, our products may not be developed in a manner that is responsive to the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our technology is important to our success, and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage.

We rely on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the United States and other countries to protect our proprietary rights. Although we own numerous United States and foreign patents and have submitted numerous patent applications, we cannot be assured that any pending patent applications will issue, or that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties. In addition, we rely on confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our know-how and trade secrets. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by competitors or other persons who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States. We cannot assure that current and former employees, contractors and other parties will not breach their confidentiality agreements with us, misappropriate proprietary information, copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop know-how and trade secrets comparable to ours or develop better technology than our own, which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed.

Our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products.

We cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel. If we are found liable for infringement, we may be compelled to enter into licensing agreements (which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all) or to pay damages or cease making or selling certain products. We may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability. Any of the foregoing events could be detrimental to our business.

Other pending and future litigation may involve significant costs and adversely affect our business.

We are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving, among other things, contracts, intellectual property, import and export regulations, employment and environmental matters. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. While we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect, the outcome of litigation, including regulatory matters, is often difficult to predict, and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.


Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

As of

December 31, 2017

, we had total consolidated indebtedness of

2.3 billion

.

Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations. It could also have significant effects on our business. For example, it could:

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;

•

limit our ability to borrow additional funds for such general corporate purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

•

restrict us from pursuing business opportunities; and

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.

If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness when due or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

•

refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness;

•

sell assets;

•

reduce or delay capital expenditures; or

•

seek to raise additional capital.

We may not be able to effect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time, the restrictions in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness and other factors, including market conditions.

Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our debt agreements impose restrictions on our business, which could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions and may adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations.

Our senior credit agreement and the indentures governing our 5.25% senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 Notes"), our 4.875% senior notes due 2026 (the "2026 Notes") and our 4.625% senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 Notes" and, together with the 2024 Notes, the "Senior Notes") contain covenants that, among other things, impose significant restrictions on our business. The restrictions that these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries include limitations on our and their ability to, among other things:

•

incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock or otherwise disqualified stock;

•

create liens;

•

pay dividends, make investments or make other restricted payments;

•

sell assets;

•

use the proceeds of permitted sales of our assets;

•

merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and

•

enter into transactions with our affiliates.

In addition, our senior credit agreement also contains financial covenants, including covenants requiring maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio, a secured leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio, calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior credit agreement. A breach of any covenants under any one or


more of our debt agreements could result in a default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt. In addition, any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions.

The warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our Convertible Notes may adversely affect the value of our common stock.

In connection with the issuance of our 3.875% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 (the "Convertible Notes"), we entered into privately negotiated hedge transactions with two counterparties, which we refer to as the "hedge counterparties." The hedge transactions involved the issuance to us of call options that covered the number of shares of our common stock underlying the Convertible Notes.  The call options were designed to reduce the dilution with respect to our common stock we were required to issue and/or cash payments we were required to make upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. Separately, we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties under which we have issued shares of our common stock, and very likely will be obligated to issue additional shares of our common stock on various warrant expiration dates that occur through August 31, 2018, at an exercise price of $74.65, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. When Convertible Notes were converted in accordance with their terms, the hedge transactions were effected through our exercise of call options; when we purchased Convertible Notes from the holders in exchange for cash and our common stock, the call options with respect to shares underlying those Convertible Notes were canceled, and the number of outstanding warrants was reduced. Following the maturity of the Convertible Notes on August 1, 2017, no further call options were outstanding, and warrants to purchase 724,648 shares of our common stock remained outstanding. Subsequent warrant exercises have had, and based on recent market prices of our common stock, will continue to have, a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock. Between November 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017, warrants to purchase 165,034 shares were exercised and, after retaining 43,251 shares to cover payment of the exercise price and paying cash in lieu of fractional shares, we delivered 105,638 shares to the hedge counterparties. As of December 31, 2017, warrants to purchase 559,614 shares of our common stock remained outstanding. If we so elect, in lieu of delivering our common stock upon exercise of the warrants, we may make cash payments to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants. In addition, under applicable accounting guidance, changes in the share price of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation with respect to the warrants, which, in turn, could impact our reported financial results. Based on the average market price of our common stock during


,

0.5 million

shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants were included in the total diluted shares outstanding for the year ended

December 31, 2017

. For additional information, see “Financing Arrangements” under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In connection with establishing their positions under the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions, the hedge counterparties (and/or their affiliates) entered into various cash-settled over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with, or shortly following, the pricing of the Convertible Notes. The hedge counterparties (and/or their affiliates) may, in their sole discretion, with or without notice, modify their hedge positions from time to time by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock, and/or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions and/or open market transactions. The effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.

We may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock, which could lower the price of our common stock.

We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock. As of

December 31, 2017

, we had outstanding approximately

45.2 million

shares of our common stock, options to purchase approximately

1.7 million

shares of our common stock (of which approximately

1.2 million

were vested as of that date), restricted stock units covering approximately

0.2 million

shares of our common stock (which are expected to vest over the next three years) and approximately

9,600

shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan. As of

December 31, 2017

,

4.5 million

shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and upon the exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the Convertible Notes. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock.


If we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock, such issuances may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. Furthermore, our issuance of shares following the exercise of some or all of the outstanding stock options and warrants, as well as the vesting of restricted stock units will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders, and any sales in the public market of such shares of our common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the issuance and sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, including common stock issued as a result of the exercise of stock options and warrants and vesting of restricted stock units could depress the price of our common stock.

Disruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships.

We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. We also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to enable us to interact with customers and suppliers, fulfill orders, generate invoices, collect and make payments, ship products, provide support to customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business. Our internal information technology systems, as well as those systems maintained by third-party providers, may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber-attacks, any of which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and in some cases have caused significant harm.  Although we have taken numerous measures to protect our information systems and enhance data security, we cannot assure that these measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation and financial results. If we fail to monitor, maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems, we could, among other things, lose customers, have difficulty preventing fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, incur expenses, lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences.  Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Regulations related to conflict minerals may increase our costs and adversely affect our business.

In 2012, the SEC promulgated rules under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding disclosure of the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, known as "conflict minerals," included in components of products either manufactured by public companies or for which public companies have contracted to manufacture. These rules require that we undertake due diligence efforts to determine whether such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo (the “DRC”) or an adjoining country and, if so, whether such minerals helped finance armed conflict in the DRC or an adjoining country. In accordance with applicable regulations, we have filed conflict minerals reports annually, beginning in 2014.  As discussed in these reports, we have determined that certain of our products contain the specified minerals, and we have undertaken, and continue to undertake, efforts to identify where such minerals originated.  We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in our products. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. Our customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals, and our revenues and margins may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide assurances to our customers that our products are “DRC conflict free” (generally, the product does not contain conflict minerals originating in the DRC or an adjoining country that directly or indirectly finance or benefit specified armed groups) due to, among other things, our inability to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price, or at all.  Moreover, we may be adversely affected if we are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting customer demands that we provide products that are DRC conflict free.  We also may face reputational challenges if our due diligence efforts do not enable us to verify the origins of all conflict minerals or to determine that any conflict minerals used in products we manufacture or in products manufactured by others for us are DRC conflict-free.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental and health and safety liabilities.

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things:

•

the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials;

•

emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and


•

the health and safety of our employees.

These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup, will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services.

As of

December 31, 2017

, approximately

10%

of our employees in the United States and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collective bargaining arrangements. It is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future. Strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business.

We may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future.

Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, requirements under covenants in our debt instruments, legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. We cannot assure that our cash dividend will not be reduced, or eliminated, in the future.

Certain provisions of our corporate governing documents, Delaware law and our senior notes could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition.

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series, the consideration, dividend rights, liquidation preferences, terms of redemption, conversion or exchange rights and voting rights, if any, of unissued series of preferred stock, without any vote or action by our stockholders. Thus, our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock. These provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party from acquiring us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders, and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock.

Certain provisions in the indentures governing the Senior Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. If an acquisition event constitutes a “change of control,” as defined in the indentures governing the Senior Notes, holders of such notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash (in the case of the 2027 Notes, the right will apply if the change in control is coupled with a ratings downgrade).  Our obligations under the Senior Notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, and accordingly could cause a reduction in the market price of our common stock.

PROPERTIES

We own or lease approximately 95 properties consisting of plants, engineering and research centers, distribution warehouses, offices and other facilities. We believe that the properties are maintained in good operating condition and are suitable for their intended use. In general, our facilities meet current operating requirements for the activities currently conducted within the facilities.

Our major facilities (those with 50,000 or greater square feet) at

December 31, 2017

are as follows:

Operations in each of our business segments are conducted at locations both in and outside of the United States. Of the facilities listed above, with the exception of Jaffrey, NH and Limerick, Ireland, which are used solely for the OEM segment, our facilities generally serve more than one business segment and are often used for multiple purposes, such as administrative/sales, manufacturing and/or warehousing/distribution.

In addition to the properties listed above, we own or lease approximately 740,000 square feet of additional warehousing, manufacturing and office space in the North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa.


ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business. These lawsuits and claims include actions involving product liability and product warranty, intellectual property, contracts, employment and environmental matters. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, we have accrued liabilities of

$3.8 million

and $2.5 million respectively, in connection with these matters, representing our best estimate of the cost within the range of estimated possible loss that will be incurred to resolve these matters. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, established reserves and other resources, we do not believe that any such actions are likely to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, in the event of unexpected further developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, or other similar matters, if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors because it facilitates an assessment of funds available to satisfy current and future obligations, pay dividends and fund acquisitions. We also use this financial measure for internal managerial purposes and to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations, such as debt service, that are not deducted from the measure. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We are a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits, improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs. We primarily design, develop, manufacture and supply single-use medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications. We market and sell our products worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors. Because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures, we are not dependent upon any one end-market or procedure. We are focused on achieving consistent, sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies.

We evaluate our portfolio of products and businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure alignment with our overall objectives. Based on our evaluation, we may identify opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that do not meet our objectives. In addition, we may seek to optimize utilization of our facilities through restructuring initiatives designed to further reduce our cost base and enhance our competitive position. For a discussion of our ongoing restructuring programs, see "

Restructuring and impairment charges

" under “Results of Operations” below.  Finally, we may continue to explore opportunities to expand the size of our business and improve our margins through a combination of acquisitions and distributor to direct sales conversions, which generally involve our elimination of a distributor from the sales channel, either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distributor relationship (in some instances, particularly in Asia, the conversions involve our acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through sub-distributors). Our distributor to direct sales conversions are designed to facilitate improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel.

On February 17, 2017, we acquired Vascular Solutions, Inc. (“Vascular Solutions”), a medical device company that developed and marketed clinical products for use in minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures, for an aggregate purchase price of $975.5 million. The acquisition is expected to meaningfully accelerate the growth of our vascular and interventional access product portfolios by facilitating our further expansion into the coronary and peripheral vascular market, and by generating increased cross-portfolio selling opportunities to both our and Vascular Solutions' customer bases.  We financed the acquisition through a combination of term loan and revolving credit borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement").  The Credit Agreement is described in more detail below under "

Borrowings

" within "Liquidity and Capital Resources".

On October 2, 2017, we completed the acquisition of NeoTract, Inc. ("NeoTract"), a medical device company that developed and commercialized the UroLift System, a minimally invasive medical device for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH.  The estimated fair value of the consideration transferred to acquire NeoTract was

$975.2 million

, which included initial payments of $725.6 million in cash less a favorable working capital adjustment of $1.4 million (for which we had not yet received payment as of December 31, 2017) and $251.0 million in estimated fair value of contingent consideration.  The contingent consideration liability represents the estimated fair value of additional consideration of up to $375 million we would be required to pay if specified net sales goals through the end of 2020 are achieved.  The acquisition of NeoTract was financed with revolving credit borrowings under our Credit Agreement. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we also completed acquisitions related to our anesthesia and respiratory product portfolios and distributor to direct sales conversions. The total fair value of the consideration related to these acquisitions was $80.1 million.

During 2016, we completed acquisitions of businesses that are included in our OEM and Asia reportable operating segments. In addition, during 2016, we acquired the remaining 26% ownership interest in an Indian affiliate from the noncontrolling shareholders; we already owned the 74% controlling interest. The total fair value of the consideration paid in these transactions was $22.8 million.

Change in Reporting Segments

Following our acquisition of Vascular Solutions, we commenced an integration program under which we are combining Vascular Solutions' businesses with certain of our legacy businesses.  Specifically, we are combining


Vascular Solutions' North American business with our interventional access business, which formerly was part of our Vascular North America operating segment, and our cardiac business, which formerly was a separate operating segment included in the "all other" category for purposes of segment reporting.  These businesses are now in our Interventional North American segment.  Additionally, we are combining the Vascular Solutions businesses in Europe, Asia and Latin America with our legacy businesses in the respective locations, and these Vascular Solutions businesses are now part of our EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), Asia and Latin America operating segments, respectively.   The changes in our operating segments, which became effective in the fourth quarter 2017, also reflect the manner in which our new chief operating decision maker assesses business performance and allocation of resources.

As a result of the operating segment changes described above, we have the following seven reportable segments: Vascular North America, Interventional North America, Anesthesia North America, Surgical North America, EMEA, Asia and OEM. In connection with the presentation of segment information, we will continue to present certain operating segments, which now include Interventional Urology and Respiratory North America as well as Latin America, in the “all other” category because they are not material. All prior comparative periods presented in this report have been restated to reflect these changes.  Additionally, because these changes affected certain of our reporting units, we reallocated the goodwill balances based on the relative fair values of the reporting units and performed goodwill impairment analyses on the affected reporting units.  We did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of these analyses.

Recently Enacted U.S. Tax Legislation

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was enacted on December 22, 2017.  The legislation significantly changes United States (or  "U.S.") tax law by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21%; implementing a territorial tax system, generally providing for, among other things, a dividends received deduction on the foreign source portion of dividends received from a foreign corporation if specified conditions are met; and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed post-1986 earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, which will be deemed repatriated for purposes of the tax.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA. SAB 118 states that in these circumstances, if the Company can determine a reasonable estimate for the income tax effects, the SEC staff would not object if the company includes in its financial statements the reasonable estimate it has determined (and the SEC staff also expressed its belief that it would not be appropriate for a company to exclude a reasonable estimate from its financial statements to the extent a reasonable estimate has been determined). We have included provisional amounts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.  While we believe that the provisional amounts constitute reasonable estimates, we continue to examine the impact the TCJA may have on our business.  Once our accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA is complete, the amounts with respect to the income tax effects of the TCJA may differ from the provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the TCJA.

In 2017, we recognized a $107.9 million net tax expense as a result of the TCJA.  Additional information on the impacts of the TCJA is included below and in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Health Care Reform

In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended, the "Affordable Care Act") was signed into law. The legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare. For medical device companies such as Teleflex, the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture, but the provisions of the legislation designed to contain the cost of healthcare could negatively affect pricing of our products and encourage patient outcome driven results. The overall impact of the Affordable Care Act on our business is yet to be determined, mainly due to uncertainties around future customer behaviors, which we believe will be affected by reimbursement factors such as insurance coverage, statistics, patient outcomes and patient satisfaction.  Several legislative initiatives to repeal the Affordable Care Act and adopt a form of replacement legislation were proposed, but not adopted, in 2017.  However, the recently adopted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the individual mandate under the Affordable Care Act, which generally required most Americans to maintain a minimum level of health insurance coverage. As a result, the level of insurance premium prices for participants in insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act is subject to


increased uncertainty. The nature and effect of any modification of, or legislative substitution for, the Affordable Care Act, as well as the longer-term viability of the act, is uncertain.

The Affordable Care Act imposed a 2.3% excise tax on sales of medical devices, beginning in 2013. Although the excise tax has been suspended through 2019, its status remains unclear for subsequent years. For the year ended December 31,


, we recorded medical device excise taxes of

$10.2 million

, which was included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Global Economic Conditions

Global economic conditions in the past decade have had adverse impacts on market activities due to, among other things, failure of financial institutions, falling asset values, diminished liquidity, reduced demand for products and services and significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In response, we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities. We continue to review and evaluate our manufacturing, warehousing and distribution processes to maximize efficiencies through the elimination of redundancies in our operations and the consolidation of facilities. Although, on a consolidated basis, the consequences of economic conditions, other than fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, have not had a significant adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country, and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last several years. While there has been some degree of improvement in economic conditions recently, the continuation of economic trends of uncertain economic growth, constricted credit, public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility, particularly with respect to the euro, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our liquidity.

In recent years, hospitals in some regions of the United States experienced a decline in admissions, a weaker payor mix, and a reduction in elective procedures.  Consequently, hospitals took actions to reduce their costs, including limiting their capital spending. Despite recent improvements in the economic environment, challenges persist, particularly in some European countries, as discussed below. Approximately

95%

of our net revenues come from single-use products primarily used in critical care and surgical applications, and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix change. Conversely, our sales volume could increase due to the greater number of insured individuals as a result of the Affordable Care Act, which has had the effect of facilitating medical insurance coverage for many persons who previously were not covered, although, as noted above, the Affordable Care Act may be subject to repeal, further modification or replacement, and its longer-term viability is uncertain.

A number of European countries continue to contend with considerable government debt, annual deficits and high levels of unemployment. Despite some indications of a more positive economic outlook in Europe, the healthcare sector remains weak.  In particular, budgetary restraints among European countries have led to cost control measures, such as delays in approvals for elective surgeries.The public healthcare systems in certain countries in Western Europe, most notably Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, have experienced significantly reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions, which continues to result in delays in payments to us by customers in these countries. Moreover, the impact of Brexit, economic and trade policies of the Trump administration and political developments in European nations could have a profound economic effect in Europe and elsewhere.

In Asia, we are experiencing an increasing trend of government-implemented price management and reimbursement controls, particularly in China and Australia. There also has been an increase in government initiatives to help local manufacturers access a bigger share of the local market. Moreover, many countries in the region have become more proactive with respect to regulatory requirements, and as a result, we expect longer, costlier and more complicated regulatory approval processes in these countries.

In Latin America, some highly regulated economies such as Argentina and Venezuela have experienced unusually high inflation rates and weakening currencies. This has impacted the budgets of the public healthcare systems resulting in delays in the importation of medical devices.  Although Latin America does not represent a significant portion of our business, our operations in this region may be adversely affected by these factors.

Results of Operations

As used in this discussion, "new products" are products for which commercial sales have commenced within the past 36 months, and “existing products” are products for which commercial sales commenced more than 36 months


ago.  Discussion of results of operations items that reference the effect of one or more acquired businesses (except as noted below with respect to acquired distributors) generally reflects the impact of the acquisitions within the first 12 months following the date of the acquisition. In addition to increases and decreases in the per unit selling prices of our products to our customers, our discussion of the impact of product price increases and decreases also reflects, for the first 12 months following the acquisition or termination of a distributor, the impact on the pricing of our products resulting from the elimination of the distributor from the sales channel. To the extent an acquired distributor had pre-acquisition sales of products other than ours, the impact of the post-acquisition sales of those products on our results of operations is included within our discussion of the impact of acquired businesses.

Certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis, which may cause minor differences.

Revenues

Comparison of 2017

and 2016

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased

14.9%

, or

$278.3 million

, compared to the prior year.  The increase is primarily attributable to net revenues of $205.8 million generated by acquired businesses, primarily Vascular Solutions and NeoTract and, to a lesser extent, an increase in new product sales.

Comparison of 2016

and 2015

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased

3.2%

, or

$58.3 million

, compared to the prior year.  The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in sales volumes of existing products of $37.3 million and an increase in new product sales of $24.2 million, both across all of our segments. The increase was partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Gross profit

Comparison of 2017 and 2016

For the year ended December 31, 2017, gross margin increased 130 basis points, or

2.4%

, compared to the prior year.  The increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to gross margin generated by acquired businesses, a more favorable mix of products sold, cost improvement initiatives, including the 2016 and 2014 footprint realignment plans described below and the impact of price increases.  These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable $10.4 million impact of the step-up in carrying value of inventory recognized in connection with the Vascular Solutions acquisition that adversely affected cost of goods sold upon sale of such inventory during 2017, as well as higher logistics and distributions costs.

Comparison of 2016

and 2015

For the year ended December 31, 2016, gross margin increased 110 basis points, or 2.1%, compared to the prior year.  The increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to the impact of an increase in sales of higher margin products, primarily in the Anesthesia North America and EMEA segments, as well as lower manufacturing costs resulting from cost improvement initiatives, including the 2014 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan.


Selling, general and administrative

Comparison of 2017 and 2016

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased

$136.7 million

during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to $108.3 million in expenses related to acquired businesses and distributor to direct conversions, the unfavorable impact of increases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Comparison of 2016 and 2015

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily attributable to the favorable impact of the suspension of the excise tax on medical devices under the Affordable Care Act of $10.2 million and the favorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of $2.7 million, partially offset by an increase in selling and marketing expenses of $7.5 million.

Research and development

Comparison of 2017

and 2016

The increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to expenses incurred by acquired businesses, primarily Vascular Solutions, and to a lesser extent, NeoTract.   Additionally, 2017 research and development expenses reflect increased spending on new product development with respect to several of our segments.

Comparison of 2016

and 2015

The increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to increased spending on new product development with respect to several of our segments

.

Restructuring and impairment charges

The following table provides information regarding restructuring charges we have incurred with respect to each of our ongoing restructuring plans and programs, as well as impairment charges, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The restructuring charges listed in the table primarily consist of termination benefits.


(1)

Impairment charges recognized in 2016 included $41.0 million related to a discontinued intellectual property research and development (IPR&D) project and two properties that were sold during the first quarter of 2017.

Anticipated charges and pre-tax savings related to restructuring plans and programs

With respect to our restructuring plans and programs that were ongoing at December 31, 2017, the table below summarizes (1) the estimated total charges that will be incurred and the estimated annual pre-tax savings once the plans and programs are completed; (2) the charges incurred and estimated pre-tax savings realized through December 31, 2017; and (3) the estimated charges to be incurred and the estimated incremental pre-tax savings to be realized for these plans and programs from January 1, 2018 through their respective anticipated completion dates.

Estimated charges and pre-tax savings are subject to change based on, among other things, the nature and timing of restructuring activities, changes in the scope of restructuring plans and programs, unanticipated expenditures and other developments, the effect of additional acquisitions or dispositions and other factors that were not reflected in the assumptions made by management in previously estimating restructuring and restructuring related charges and estimated pre-tax savings.  Moreover, estimated pre-tax savings relating to programs involving the integration of acquired businesses are particularly difficult to forecast because the estimate of pre-tax savings, to a considerable extent, involves assumptions regarding operation of businesses during periods when those businesses were not administered by our management.  It is likely that estimates of charges and pre-tax savings will change from time to time, and the table below reflects changes from amounts previously estimated.  In addition, the table below has been updated to remove estimated charges and pre-tax savings related to completed programs. Estimated charges and pre-tax savings are described in more detail below, within the discussions of the specific restructuring plans and programs.

(1)

Restructuring related charges principally constitute accelerated depreciation and other costs primarily related to the transfer of manufacturing operations to new locations and are expected to be recognized primarily in cost of goods sold.

(2)

Approximately 55% of the pre-tax savings are expected to result in reductions to cost of goods sold.  As previously disclosed, during 2016, in connection with our execution of the 2014 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan, we implemented changes to medication delivery devices included in certain of our kits, which are expected to result in increased product costs (and therefore reduced the annual savings we anticipated at the inception of the program).  However, we also expect to achieve improved pricing on these kits to offset the cost, which is expected to result in estimated annual increased revenues of $5 million to $6 million, which is not reflected in the table above.  We realized a $1.0 million benefit resulting from this incremental pricing in 2017.  More recently, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into an agreement with an alternate provider for the development and supply of a component to be included in certain kits sold by our Vascular and Anesthesia North America operating segments. The agreement will result in increased development costs, but is expected to reduce the cost of the component supply, once the supply becomes commercially available, as compared to the costs


incurred with respect to our current suppliers. Therefore, we anticipate a net savings from the agreement, which is reflected in the table above. See “2014 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan” below for additional information.

(3)

While pre-tax savings address anticipated cost savings to be realized with respect to our historical expense items, they also reflect anticipated efficiencies to be realized with respect to increased costs that otherwise would have resulted from our acquisition of Vascular Solutions and Pyng Medical Corp. ("Pyng"), which we acquired in 2017.  In this regard, the pre-tax savings are expected to result from the elimination of redundancies between our operations and Vascular Solutions’ and Pyng's operations, principally through the elimination of personnel redundancies.

The following provides additional details with respect to our ongoing restructuring plans and programs:

2017 Vascular Solutions Integration Program

During the first quarter 2017, we committed to a restructuring program related to the integration of Vascular Solutions' operations into our operations.  We initiated the program in the first quarter 2017 and expect the program to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter 2018.  We estimate that we will record aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of $6.5 million to $8.0 million related to this program as compared to the prior estimate of $6.0 million to $7.5 million.  We expect $5.5 million to $6.2 million of the total restructuring charges will constitute termination benefits, and $1.0 million to $1.8 million will relate to other exit costs, including employee relocation and outplacement costs.  Additionally, we expect to incur $2.5 million to $3.0 million of restructuring related charges, consisting primarily of retention bonuses offered to certain employees expected to remain with our company after completion of the program.  All of these charges will result in future cash outlays.  We began realizing program-related savings in the first quarter 2017 and expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of $25 million to $30 million once the program is fully implemented.  This is an increase as compared to the prior estimate of $20 million to $25 million.  The increase in the estimated restructuring charges and annual pre-tax savings ranges as compared to the prior estimates were the result of an increase in the headcount reduction initially contemplated under the program.

2017 EMEA Restructuring Program

During the first quarter 2017, we committed to a restructuring program to centralize certain administrative functions in Europe.  The program commenced in the second quarter 2017 and is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2018.  We estimate that we will record aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $5.0 million related to this program, almost all of which constitute termination benefits, and all of which will result in future cash outlays.  This represents a decrease as compared to the prior estimate of aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of $7.1 million to $8.5 million.  We expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of approximately $2.5 million once the program is fully implemented and will begin realizing program related savings in the first quarter 2018.  This represents a decrease as compared to the prior estimate of annual pre-tax savings of $2.7 million to $3.3 million.  The reduction in expected charges and annual pre-tax savings is the result of a decrease in the headcount reduction initially contemplated under the program.

2016 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan

In  2016, we initiated a restructuring plan involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations, the relocation and outsourcing of certain distribution operations and a related workforce reduction at certain of our facilities.  (the "2016 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan"). These actions commenced in the first quarter 2016 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2018.  We estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax charges in connection with these restructuring activities of approximately $34 million to $44 million, of which we estimate $27 million to $31 million will result in future cash outlays. Additionally, we expect to incur aggregate capital expenditures of approximately $17 million to $19 million in connection with the 2016 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan. We began realizing plan-related savings in 2017 and expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of $12 million to $16 million once the plan is fully implemented.

2014 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan

In April 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan (the "2014 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan") involving the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain facilities, and the relocation of manufacturing operations from certain higher-cost locations to existing lower-cost locations. These actions commenced in the second quarter 2014.

During the fourth quarter 2017, we executed an agreement with an alternate provider for the development and supply of a component to be included in certain kits primarily sold by our Vascular North America and Anesthesia North America operating segments.  This will result in increased development costs, but also is expected to reduce the cost


of the component supply once it becomes commercially available, as compared to costs incurred with respect to current suppliers.  Therefore, we anticipate a net savings as a result of this agreement.  As a result, we revised our cost , annual pre-tax savings and timing estimates with respect to the 2014 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan.  We estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax charges in connection with the 2014 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan of approximately

$46 million

to

$51 million

, compared to our most recent prior estimate of approximately $43 million to $48 million.  Additionally, we estimate that we will achieve annual pre-tax savings of $26 million to $29 million as compared to our most recent prior estimate of $23 million to $27 million.  As a result of the changes to the plan described above, we now expect the plan will be substantially complete by the end of 2021, as compared to our prior estimate of the second half of 2020.

We continue to anticipate an increase in annual revenues resulting from improved pricing on our Vascular kits as a result of changes made to our medication delivery devices.  We anticipate that this projected increase in annual revenues, taken together with the projected annual savings we expect to realize under the 2014 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan, should enable us to improve our pre-tax income on an annual basis by approximately $31 million to $35 million once the plan has been completed.

We expect aggregate cash outlays associated with the plan to be in the range of $38 million to $43 million, compared to our most recent prior estimate of approximately

$33 million

to

$38 million

.  Additionally, we continue to expect that we will incur

$24 million

to

$30 million

in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan.

2016 Other Restructuring Programs

During the second half of 2016, we commenced restructuring activities involving the consolidation of global administrative functions and manufacturing operations. These programs are expected to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 2018. We estimate that we will record aggregate pre-tax charges of $3.8 million to $4.7 million related to these programs, which constitute termination benefits and contract termination costs that will result in future cash outlays. Additionally, we expect to incur approximately $1.5 million of accelerated depreciation and other costs directly related to the programs, which we anticipate will be recognized in cost of goods sold; we anticipate that approximately $1.0 million of this amount will result in cash outlays.  As of December 31, 2017, we expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of $9.0 million to $10.0 million once this program is fully implemented, which is an increase to the prior estimate of $6.9 million to $8.5 million.  The increase in the estimated annual pre-tax savings is due to an increase in the headcount reduction initially contemplated under the program.

Interest expense

Comparison of 2017 and 2016

The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding, mainly attributable to borrowings under the Credit Agreement that were utilized to fund the Vascular Solutions and  NeoTract acquisitions, offset by a slight decline in the average interest rate on debt.

Comparison of 2016 and 2015

The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily due to our repurchase of our 3.875% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017 (the "Convertible Notes") from certain holders of those notes in exchange for cash and shares of our common stock (which transactions are referred to below as "exchange transactions") and conversions of the Convertible Notes, resulting in lower average amounts of debt outstanding compared to the prior period. The decrease was also the result of a lower average interest rate due to our June 1, 2015 redemption of our 6.875% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2019 (the "2019 Notes"), which were replaced by borrowings under our previous revolving credit facility and subsequently by our issuance of 4.875%


Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”). The interest rates on both the revolving credit facility and the 2026 Notes are lower than the interest rate on the 2019 Notes.  The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by financing fees of $3.4 million incurred for the year ended December 31, 2016 to secure bridge financing commitments related to our acquisition of Vascular Solutions.

Loss on extinguishment of debt

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a $5.6 million loss on the extinguishment of debt, of which $5.2 million related to our repurchase, on January 5, 2017, of $91.7 million in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes through exchange transactions with certain holders of the Convertible Notes, and $0.4 million related to the amendment and restatement of our previous credit agreement, which was considered a partial extinguishment of debt. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $19.3 million, of which, $16.3 million related to our repurchase of $219.2 million in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes through exchange transactions with certain holders of the Convertible Notes and $3.0 million related to the conversions of $44.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes.

Gain on sale of assets

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain of $4.4 million, primarily as a result of the sale, for $8.9 million, of two buildings, one of which was previously classified as held for sale.

Taxes on income from continuing operations

We generate substantial earnings from our international operations. Most of the international jurisdictions in which we file tax returns historically have had statutory tax rates that are lower than the United States statutory tax rate; as a result, our consolidated effective income tax rate for 2017 (excluding the impact of the TCJA) and earlier years has been substantially below the United States statutory tax rate. The principal international jurisdictions in which the statutory tax rate in 2017 and earlier years is lower than the United States statutory tax rate and from which we derive substantial earnings include Ireland, Bermuda, Luxembourg, Germany and Italy.

Despite the TCJA's reduction of the United States corporate income tax rate, we anticipate that we will continue to have a consolidated effective income tax rate that is below the newly enacted statutory tax rate due to the lower tax rates applicable to our foreign operations in many of the relevant international jurisdictions. However, changes to either the currently enacted United States tax rates or international statutory tax rates could affect our effective income tax rate in the future.

Excluding the impact of any discrete items, the provisions of the TCJA are expected to be neutral or to reduce somewhat our effective tax rate in 2018 compared to what the rate would have been prior to the adoption of the TCJA . The ultimate impact on our effective tax rate will largely depend on a variety of factors, including the portion of pretax earnings that we generate in various taxing jurisdictions.


Comparison of 2017 and 2016

The effective income tax rate for


was

45.5%

compared to

3.3%

for


. Taxes on income from continuing operations in 2017 were

$129.6 million

compared to

$8.1 million

in 2016. The effective income tax rate for


was impacted by a net tax expense of $107.9 million resulting from the enactment of the TCJA.  The $107.9 million net tax expense reflects a tax expense of $154.0 million for the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, partially offset by a $46.1 million tax benefit resulting from the reassessment and revaluation of the net deferred tax liabilities.  Additionally, the effective tax rate for 2017 was impacted by a net excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation and a benefit resulting from the expiration of various statutes of limitation. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Comparison of 2016 and 2015

The effective income tax rate in 2016 was

3.3%

compared to

3.2%

in 2015. Taxes on income from continuing operations in 2016 were

$8.1 million

compared to

$7.8 million

in 2015. The effective income tax rate for 2016 was impacted by a tax benefit associated with U.S. federal tax return filings, a benefit resulting from the reduction of German tax reserves as a result of the conclusion of an audit, a benefit resulting from the expiration of various statutes of limitation and a benefit associated with an IPR&D asset impairment.

, or

7.9

%, compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to net revenues of $7.5 million generated by acquired businesses (primarily Vascular Solutions), as well as increases in sales volumes of existing products, new product sales and price increases.  We experienced a decline in sales of certain product lines in China during 2017 as a result of a distributor to direct sales conversion, as we implemented a new structure to support product sales.  However, this decline was more than offset by a net increase in sales volumes in the remainder of the Asia segment.  During the first quarter 2017, the distributor in China that we terminated in connection with the distributor to direct sales conversion commenced an arbitration proceeding against us, seeking, among other things, to compel our repurchase of Teleflex products that the distributor held in its inventory. In February 2018, we entered into a settlement agreement with the distributor with respect to the outstanding arbitration claims. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

The decreases in operating profit were partially offset by the favorable impact of the suspension of the excise tax on medical devices under the Affordable Care Act and lower research and development expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, acquisitions, pension funding, dividends, taxes, scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness, adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to capital markets.

We believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility (which is provided for under our Credit Agreement) and accounts receivable securitization facility will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.

Of our

$333.6 million

of cash and cash equivalents at

December 31, 2017

,

$286.3 million

was held at foreign subsidiaries.  We manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis.

The TCJA significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, imposing a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed post-1986 earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries.  Previously, we were not taxed on foreign earnings deemed to be permanently invested overseas. Under the TCJA, we will have to pay $154.0 million over eight years for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, regardless of whether such earnings are actually repatriated. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.  As a result of the repatriation tax provisions of the TCJA, we anticipate that, generally, we will be able to access cash located at our foreign subsidiaries without incurring any additional U.S. federal income tax liabilities.  We are not aware of any other restrictions on repatriation of these funds and, subject to cash payment of additional foreign withholding taxes, these funds could be repatriated, if necessary.

We have not experienced significant payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated operating needs. However, as discussed above in "Global Economic Conditions", although there have been recent improvements in certain countries, global financial markets remain volatile and the global credit markets are constrained, which creates risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity. Consequently, we continue to monitor our credit risk, particularly with respect to customers in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, as well as consider other risk mitigation strategies.  In January 2017, we sold $16.1 million of receivables payable from publicly funded hospitals in Italy for $16.0 million.


As of

December 31, 2017

and


, our net trade accounts receivable from publicly funded hospitals in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain were

$24.7 million

and

$29.2 million

, respectively. For the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


, net revenues from customers in these countries were approximately

6%

,

7%

and

7%

, respectively, of our total net revenues, and average days that current and long-term trade accounts receivable with respect to these customers were outstanding were


,


and


days, respectively. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, net current and long-term trade accounts receivable from these countries were approximately

15%

and

19%

, respectively, of our consolidated net current and long-term trade accounts receivable. If economic conditions in these countries deteriorate, we may experience significant credit losses related to the public hospital systems in these countries. Moreover, if global economic conditions generally deteriorate, we may experience further delays in customer payments, reductions in our customers’ purchases and higher credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in 2018 and future years. See "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" below for additional information regarding the critical accounting estimates related to our accounts receivable.

The aggregate total fair value of consideration we provided for the acquisitions we made in


and


was

$2.0 billion

and

$22.8 million

, respectively. The most significant acquisitions completed in 2017 were Vascular Solutions and NeoTract.  See

Note 3

to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions.

In January 2017, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which provides for a five-year revolving credit facility of $1.0 billion and a term loan facility of $750.0 million.  We used the term loan facility to finance most of the consideration for the Vascular Solutions acquisition (the remaining consideration was provided through borrowings under the revolving credit facility).  The revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital and other liquidity needs. In addition, during 2017, we reacquired, through conversion or exchange, and retired our 3.875% convertible senior subordinated notes, which matured on August 1, 2017 ("Convertible Notes"), using available funds under the revolving credit facility.  We also used $725 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance, in part, our acquisition of NeoTract.  Additionally, in November 2017, we sold $500.0 million in principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 Notes"), the net proceeds of which were used to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility.

In connection with the original issuance of the Convertible Notes in 2010, we entered into a convertible note hedge transaction to purchase call options.  The call options enabled the Company to economically hedge the dilutive impact of the Convertible Notes conversions on the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding.  In connection with Convertible Note conversions and exchanges, we exercised or unwound these related call options.  We also entered into warrant transactions in connection with issuance of the Convertible Notes.  Counterparties continue to hold warrants to purchase our common stock that they acquired at the time of the initial issuance of the Convertible Notes.  At December 31, 2017, warrants to purchase 559,614 shares at an exercise price of $74.65 per share remained outstanding.  The remaining warrants expire ratably over a period ending on August 31, 2018.  At December 31, 2017, the intrinsic value of the warrants (i.e. the excess of the aggregate market price of the underlying shares over the aggregate exercise price of the warrants) was $98.0 million.

We may at any time, from time to time, repurchase our outstanding debt securities in open market purchases, via tender offers or in privately negotiated transactions, exchange transactions or otherwise, at such price or prices as we deem appropriate.  Such purchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time.

See "Financing Arrangements" below as well as Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to our borrowings.


Cash Flows

The following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented:

Comparison of


and


Cash Flow from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was

$426.3 million

during 2017 and

$410.6 million

during 2016. The

$15.7 million

increase is attributable to favorable operating results partially offset by a net cash outflow for income taxes resulting primarily from a tax refund received in 2016.  Excluding income taxes, the net impact of the working capital changes was consistent in 2017 as compared to 2016; an increase in inventories was offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and to a lesser extent, a net decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets.  The increase in inventories for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $22.4 million compared to a decrease of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The increase is attributable to inventory purchases to achieve desired safety stock levels as well as inventory from a former Chinese distributor that was returned to us during 2017 as part of an arbitration proceeding.  See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding this arbitration proceeding.  The net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to an increase of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016; the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payroll and benefit related accruals.

Cash Flow from Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was

$1.8 billion

during 2017, primarily resulting from $1.8 billion in payments for businesses acquired, principally Vascular Solutions and NeoTract; and capital expenditures of $70.9 million, which were partially offset by proceeds of $6.3 million from the sale of two properties, one of which was a building that had been previously classified as held for sale.

Cash Flow from Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was

$1.1 billion

during 2017, primarily resulting  from a net increase in borrowings of $1.2 billion.  Our borrowings under the Credit Agreement included $1.0 billion to finance the Vascular Solutions acquisition, together with related fees and expenses, and $725 million to finance the NeoTract acquisition. In addition, we sold $500 million in principal amount of the 2027 Notes.  These increases were partially offset by our repayments of 1.1 billion of borrowings under the Credit Agreement.  Additionally, we had a $136.1 million reduction in borrowings under our 3.875% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017 (the "Convertible Notes") resulting from exchange transactions, and payment upon maturity of all remaining Convertible Notes outstanding, each of which is discussed below under "Borrowings."

Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was also impacted by dividend payments of $61.2 million and debt issuance and amendment fees of $26.7 million, which included fees paid in connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement, the issuance of the 2027 Notes and a bridge facility and backstop commitment that was put in place to assist with the financing of the Vascular Solutions acquisition, but was never utilized because the required financing was provided under the Credit Agreement.


Comparison of


and


Cash Flow from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $410.6 million during 2016 and $303.4 million during 2015. The $107.2 million increase is primarily attributable to improved operating results, a net favorable impact from changes in working capital and a reduction in income tax payments.

The net cash inflow from working capital is primarily the result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in inventories partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable.  The cash inflow for accounts payable and accrued expenses was $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a  cash outflow of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The cash inflow for accounts payable and accrued expenses, excluding the impact of the net increase in the restructuring reserve, is attributable to certain non-recurring accrued expense payments made during the year ended December 31, 2015. The cash inflow for inventories was $6.4 million in 2016 as compared to a $8.4 million net cash outflow in 2015.  The lower inventory levels in 2016 are primarily the result of higher than expected net revenues in the fourth quarter and fewer inventory builds in support of distributor to direct sales conversions.  The cash outflow related to accounts receivable was $11.0 million in 2016 as compared to a cash inflow of $0.4 million in 2015.  The increase in accounts receivable for the year ended December 31, 2016 is attributable to higher fourth quarter net revenues as compared to 2015, partially offset by stronger collections, particularly in Europe.

Cash Flow from Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $57.0 million during 2016, primarily resulting from capital expenditures of $53.1 million and payments for businesses and intangibles acquired of $14.0 million. The acquired business and intangibles included certain assets of CarTika Medical, Inc. and certain distributors in New Zealand, which were comprised primarily of intangible assets, including goodwill, and inventory. These payments were partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of $10.2 million, primarily related to two buildings.

Cash Flow from Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $118.7 million during 2016, primarily resulting  from dividends paid of $59.0 million and a net reduction in borrowings of $42.9 million.  The net reduction in borrowings included reductions of $263.6 million resulting from exchange transactions and conversions related to Convertible Notes and the net reduction of $186.0 million in the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility, partially offset by our issuance of $400.0 million in principal amount of the 2026 Notes and increased borrowings of $6.7 million under our securitization program.  Net cash used in financing activities also reflected a $9.2 million payment for our acquisition of the remaining 26% noncontrolling interest of Teleflex Medical Private Limited, our Indian affiliate in which we already owned the 74% controlling interest, $9.0 million in debt extinguishment, issuance and amendment fees, including transaction fees associated with the issuance of the 2026 Notes and $7.3 million in contingent consideration payments.  These cash payments were partially offset by $9.1 million of net proceeds from share-based compensation plans and the related tax benefits, primarily related to stock option exercises.


Financing Arrangements

The following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio:

Fixed rate debt comprised

50.7%

and

75.1%

of total debt at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.  The decrease in fixed rate borrowings as a percentage of total borrowings at December 31, 2017 compared to the fixed rate borrowings as a percentage of total borrowings at December 31, 2016 is primarily due to variable rate borrowings under our amended and restated senior credit facility (described below) offset by the increase in fixed rate borrowings as a result of the issuance of the 2027 Notes.

Amended and restated senior credit facility

On January 20, 2017, we amended and restated our then-existing senior credit agreement by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”).  As noted above, the Credit Agreement provides for a five-year revolving credit facility of $1.0 billion and a term loan facility of $750.0 million. The term loan facility and borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to finance the acquisition of Vascular Solutions. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed (subject to certain exceptions and limitations) by substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a lien on substantially all of our and each guarantor's owned assets.  The revolving credit facility and the term loan facility will mature on January 20, 2022 and February 17, 2022, respectively. At

December 31, 2017

, we had

$349.0 million

in borrowings outstanding and approximately

$3.2 million

in outstanding standby letters of credit under our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility.

The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, qualifications and thresholds, place limitations on our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, create additional liens, enter into a merger, consolidation or amalgamation, dispose of certain assets, make certain investments or acquisitions, pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements.  Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a consolidated total leverage ratio (generally, Consolidated Total Funded Indebtedness, as defined in the Credit Agreement, on the determination date to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the determination date) of not more than 4.50 to 1, a secured leverage ratio (generally, Consolidated Senior Secured Funded Indebtedness, as defined in the Credit Agreement, on the determination date to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement, for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the determination date) of not more than 3.50 to 1 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio (generally, Consolidated EBITDA for the four most recent quarters ending on or preceding the determination date to Consolidated Interest Expense, as defined in the Credit Agreement, paid in cash for such period) of not less than 3.50 to 1.

See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Credit Agreement.


2024, 2026 and 2027 Senior Notes (collectively, the "Senior Notes")

As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Notes, 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes was $250.0, $400.0 million and $500.0 million, respectively. The indentures governing the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur debt, create liens, consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets, make certain investments, engage in acquisitions, and pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock, subject to specified conditions. The indenture governing the 2027 Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to create liens; consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets; and enter into sale leaseback transactions. The obligations under the Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of our existing and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries that are a guarantor or other obligor under the Credit Agreement and by certain of our other 100% owned domestic subsidiaries. As of

December 31, 2017

, we were in compliance with all of the terms of our Senior Notes.

Accounts receivable securitization

We have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell an undivided interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to $50.0 million to a commercial paper conduit. As of

December 31, 2017

, we borrowed the maximum amount available of

$50.0 million

under this facility. This facility is utilized to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements. The agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events. An occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility. As of

December 31, 2017

, we were in compliance with the covenants and none of the termination events had occurred.  As of December 31,


, we had

$50.0 million

of outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility.

Convertible notes

Our Convertible Notes matured on August 1, 2017 (the "Maturity Date").  The Convertible Notes were convertible under certain circumstances, including the attainment of at least a specified last reported sales price per share of our common stock during a specified period. Since the fourth quarter 2013, our closing stock price exceeded the threshold for conversion.  Moreover, commencing on May 1, 2017 and through July 28, 2017, the Convertible Notes were convertible regardless of the closing price of our stock. We elected a net settlement method to satisfy our conversion obligations, under which we settled the conversion of Convertible Notes by paying the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash and providing shares having a value equal to the excess of the conversion value of the Convertible Notes over the principal amount of the notes; however, cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares.

In January 2017, we acquired $91.7 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes in exchange for an aggregate of $93.2 million in cash (including approximately $1.5 million in accrued and previously unpaid interest) and approximately 0.93 million shares of our common stock (the “Exchange Transactions”). We funded the cash portion of the consideration paid through borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In advance of the maturity of the Convertible Notes, $44.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes (the "Converted Notes") were tendered to us for conversion. On the Maturity Date, we repaid the remaining $44.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes outstanding, together with unpaid interest due and owing on the Convertible Notes (the “Cash Payment”).  In addition to the Cash Payment, on the Maturity Date, we delivered to the holders of the Converted Notes, in the aggregate, 0.5 million shares of our common stock.  We funded the Cash Payment through borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

For additional information regarding our indebtedness, see

Note 8

to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


Contractual Obligations

Contractual obligations at

December 31, 2017

are as follows:

(1)

Interest payments on floating rate debt are based on the interest rate in effect on

December 31, 2017

.

(2)

Purchase and other obligations are defined as an unconditional commitments to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: quantities to be purchased; price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The amounts include commitments for inventory purchases and capital expenditures that do not exceed our projected requirements in the normal course of business and penalties due upon cancellation of cancellable agreements; the amounts exclude operating lease obligations.

(3)

Pursuant to the provisions of the TCJA, we recognized tax expense of

$154.0 million

for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, which  we have elected to pay in annual installments over eight years (as prescribed by the TCJA).

We recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of

$12.3 million

and

$17.5 million

as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments that will be required to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made and as a result, these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above.

We recorded contingent consideration liabilities of

$272.1 million

and

$7.1 million

as of December 31,


and


, respectively, of which

$74.2 million

and $0.6 million, respectively, were recorded as the current portion of contingent consideration.  Due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of future payments related to these liabilities, these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above.

See Notes 10, 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from the amounts derived from those estimates and assumptions.

We have identified the following as critical accounting estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.  The following discussion should be considered in conjunction with the description of our accounting policies in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

In the ordinary course of business, we grant non-interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms.  In an effort to reduce our credit risk, we (i) establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships, (ii) perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition, (iii) monitor the payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables, and (iv) monitor open orders against an individual customer’s outstanding receivable balance.


An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for trade accounts receivable based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable, after considering the Company's historical collection experience, the length of time an account is outstanding, the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services. The adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary.  Our allowance for doubtful accounts was

$10.3 million

and

$8.6 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively, which constituted

2.8%

and

3.0%

of gross trade accounts receivable at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

In light of the volatility in global economic markets in recent years, we have procedures in place within countries where we have collectability concerns to facilitate customer-by-customer risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts.  These procedures include monthly credit control committee meetings, at which customer credit risks are identified after review of, among other things, accounts that exceed specified credit limits, payment delinquencies and other customer issues.  In addition, with respect to government customers, we evaluate receivables for potential collection risks associated with any limitations on the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices.  To reduce risk exposures with respect to certain of our non-government customers, we have instituted procedures that include reducing credit limits and requiring that payments accompany orders. Some of our customers, particularly in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided resulting in collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers. If the financial condition of these customers or the healthcare systems in these countries deteriorate to the extent that the ability of an increasing number of customers to make payments is uncertain, additional allowances may be required in future periods.

Although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments, we cannot be assured that the allowances will be sufficient to cover future losses given the volatility in the worldwide economy and the possibility that other, unanticipated events may adversely affect collectability of the accounts.  If our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible, we would be required to incur additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  Moreover, our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations.

Distributor Rebates

We offer rebates to certain distributors and record a reserve with respect to the estimated amount of the rebates as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale. In estimating rebates, we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor’s rebate claim, distributor-specific trend analyses, contractual commitments, including stated rebate rates, historical experience and other relevant information. When necessary, we adjust the reserves, with a corresponding adjustment to revenue, to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience. Historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future. The reserve for estimated rebates was

$12.2 million

and

$11.6 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. We expect to pay amounts subject to the reserve as of

December 31, 2017

within 90 days subsequent to year-end.

Inventory Utilization

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory that reduces the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence, damage or other issues affecting marketability.  The reduction in carrying value is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated net realizable value.  Factors utilized in the determination of estimated net realizable value and whether a reserve is required include (i) current sales data and historical return rates, (ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive pricing pressures, (iv) new product introductions, (v) product expiration dates, and (vi) component and packaging obsolescence.

The adequacy of the reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary.  We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. In assessing historical usage, we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information in estimating future usage.

Our inventory reserve was

$35.6 million

and

$36.4 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively, which represents

8.3%

and 10.3% of gross inventories at those respective dates.


Long-Lived Assets

We assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For example, such an assessment may be initiated if, as a result of a change in expectations, we believe it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life or if an adverse change occurs in the business employing the asset. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether such events or circumstances have occurred and determining the appropriate asset group requiring evaluation. The recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow projections, which involve significant management judgment. Any impairment loss, if indicated, equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets include indefinite-lived assets (such as goodwill, certain trade names and in-process research and development ("IPR&D")), as well as finite-lived intangibles (such as trade names that do not have indefinite lives, customer relationships, intellectual property and distribution rights). The costs of finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life.  Determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets typically will have different useful lives. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; we test these assets annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred. Such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles.

Considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the impairment analysis including evaluating the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and estimating future cash flows, which are key elements in determining fair value. Assumptions we use in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans. We believe these assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.

Goodwill

Goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level. For purposes of this assessment, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment. We have ten reporting units.  In applying the goodwill impairment test, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step quantitative impairment test, described below. Alternatively, we may test goodwill for impairment through the two-step quantitative impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis.  Under guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the quantitative goodwill impairment test will be simplified, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, subject to optional early adoption. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

The first step of the two-step impairment test is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value. In performing the first step, we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using equal weighting of two methods; one which estimates the discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future (the Income Approach) and one which is based on sales of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions (the Market Approach).  If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. If the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, which we determine in the second step of the two-step test. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit's identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially.


Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment. The more significant judgments and assumptions used in the Income Approach include (1) the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales, operating income, industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units, (2) the expected long-term growth rates for each of our reporting units, which approximate the expected long-term growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry, and (3) discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values, which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs.  The more significant judgments and assumptions used in the Market Approach include (1) determination of appropriate revenue and EBITDA multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value and (2) the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples. There were no changes to the underlying methods used in


as compared to the valuations of our reporting units in 2016.

Our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales, operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans, which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year; the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle. Changes in assumptions underlying the Income Approach could cause a reporting unit's carrying value to exceed its fair value. While we believe our assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable, the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected, and, as a result, the estimated fair value of that reporting unit may decline. In this regard, if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit, the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and, in such case, we may incur material impairment charges.  Moreover, changes in revenue and EBITDA multiples in actual transactions from those historically present could result in an assessment that a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, in which case we also may incur material impairment charges.

We did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter


.  As noted above under “Changes in Reporting Segments,” because changes in our operating segments during the fourth quarter 2017 affected certain of our reporting units, we reallocated the goodwill balances of the reporting units based on their relative fair values and performed goodwill impairment analyses on those reporting units. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of these analyses.

Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill. Management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Similar to the goodwill impairment test process, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, the asset is not impaired. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test, which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. Alternatively, we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and test the indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test.

In connection with the quantitative impairment test, since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets, we utilize several present value techniques to estimate fair value. The fair value of trade names and IPR&D is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method, a form of income approach that values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset. Under this method, an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party. The value of the hypothetical royalty, which is based on the estimated royalty rate applied against forecasted sales, is tax-effected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset. Management must estimate the volume of sales, hypothetical royalty rate, discount rate, and terminal growth rate to estimate the hypothetical royalty associated with the asset.  Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated from the intangible asset. Assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar intangible assets are being licensed in the marketplace.


No impairment was recorded as a result of the annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter


.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a pre-tax IPR&D impairment charge of $41.0 million.  See "Restructuring and impairment charges" within "Result of Operations" above as well as Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on this charge.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

We provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including under plans that provide pension and postretirement healthcare benefits. Several statistical and other factors that are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans. These factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. We review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.

Significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense. The following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions:

For additional information on assumptions pertaining to pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Share-based Compensation

We estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. Share-based compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options, volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. The expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding, which is derived from the vesting period of the award, as well as historical exercise behavior. Expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock, which we believe is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on United States Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option. Share based compensation expense for


,


and


was

$19.4 million

,

$16.9 million

and

$14.5 million

, respectively.

Contingent Consideration Liabilities

In connection with an acquisition, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives, such as receipt of regulatory approval, commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets. As of the acquisition date, we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay. We determined the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the NeoTract acquisition, which represented the vast majority of our contingent consideration liabilities at December 31, 2017, using a Monte Carlo valuation approach, which simulates future revenues during the earn out-period using management's best estimates.  We determined the fair value of our other contingent consideration liabilities using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis.  Increases in projected revenues and probabilities of payment may result in significantly higher fair value measurements; decreases in these items may have the opposite effect. Increases in discount rates and the period prior to payment may result in significantly lower fair value


measurements; decreases in these items may have the opposite effect. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on  Form 10-K for additional information.

We remeasure the liability each reporting period and recognize the change in the liability's fair value within selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income.  As of

December 31, 2017

and


, we accrued

$272.1 million

and

$7.1 million

of contingent consideration, respectively. For the year ended December 31,


there were no changes to the estimated probabilities associated with the contingent consideration liabilities. For the years ended December 31


and


, we recognized a reduction to contingent consideration of

$8.3 million

and

$4.4 million

, respectively, resulting from changes in estimated probabilities associated with certain regulatory and sales milestones.

Income Taxes

Our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. We conduct a broad range of operations around the world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. In connection with its estimates of our tax assets and liabilities, management must, among other things, make judgments about the outcome of these uncertain matters. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates, which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final United States and foreign tax settlements, changes in tax law, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions. While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities, which could be material.

In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we evaluate positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events, including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets.  To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.  The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of

$104.8 million

and

$104.5 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions.

Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, we are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate an adjustment. We are currently under examination in Canada, Germany, Italy and the United States.  The ultimate outcome of these examinations could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities, which would affect our financial results. See

Note 13

to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions.

As noted above, the TCJA significantly changes U.S. tax law.  As permitted by SAB 118, we have included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, provisional amounts reflecting the tax impact related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Once our accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA is complete, the amounts with respect to the income tax effects of the TCJA may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the TCJA. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk

We are exposed to certain financial risks, specifically fluctuations in market interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, commodity prices. We use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes. We are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances. The table below provides information regarding the interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations. Variable interest rates on

December 31, 2017

were determined using a base rate of the one-month LIBOR rate plus the applicable spread.

A change of 1.0% in variable interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by

$7.1 million

based on our outstanding debt as of

December 31, 2017

.

Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to currency fluctuations in connection with transactions, as well as monetary assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.  We enter into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge the risk associated with these exposures; these contracts generally involve the purchase or sale, at designated future dates, of specified amounts of a foreign currency while simultaneously committing to an opposite way sale or purchase of a specified amount of U.S. dollars or euros, based on the exchange rate at the time of entry into the contract.  The contracts we enter into to hedge transactions denominated in non-functional currencies are designated as cash flow hedges. The contracts to hedge monetary asset and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies are not designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges.  See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the accounting treatment of designated and non-designated hedge contracts.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. We acquired Vascular Solutions and NeoTract on February 17, 2017 and October 2, 2017, respectively.  Consistent with the guidance provided by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, management has excluded Vascular Solutions and NeoTract from its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.  The net revenues attributable to Vascular Solutions and NeoTract were $152.6 million and $39.0 million, respectively, from the respective dates of acquisition through December 31, 2017, representing, in the aggregate, 9% of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.  Total assets of Vascular Solutions and NeoTract (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) at December 31, 2017 were $303.2 million and $49.1 million, respectively, representing, in aggregate, 6% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2017.

Our management’s report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth on page F-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

(c) Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of our acquisition of Vascular Solutions and NeoTract, we are in the process of evaluating both acquisitions' internal controls to determine the extent to which modifications to Vascular Solutions' and NeoTract's internal controls would be appropriate.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Teleflex Incorporated and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected by the Company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

. In making this assessment, management used the framework established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As a result of this assessment and based on the criteria in the COSO framework, management has concluded that, as of

December 31, 2017

, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The Company acquired Vascular Solutions, Inc. ("Vascular Solutions") and NeoTract, Inc. ("NeoTract") on February 17, 2017 and October 2, 2017, respectively.  Management has excluded Vascular Solutions and NeoTract from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. The net revenues attributable to Vascular Solutions and NeoTract were $152.6 million and $39.0 million, respectively, from the respective dates of acquisition through December 31, 2017, representing, in aggregate, 9% of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.  Total assets of Vascular Solutions and NeoTract (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) at December 31, 2017 were $303.2 million and $49.1 million, respectively, representing, in aggregate, 6% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2017.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Teleflex Incorporated

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes and financial statement schedule of Teleflex Incorporated and its subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index appearing on page F-1 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in “Management's  Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” appearing on page F-2.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Vascular Solutions, Inc. and NeoTract, Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 because they were both acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2017.  We have also excluded Vascular Solutions, Inc. and NeoTract, Inc. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.  Vascular Solutions, Inc. and NeoTract, Inc. are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total revenues and total assets excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting collectively represent approximately 9% of total revenues, in aggregate, and approximately 6% of total assets, in aggregate, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary of significant accounting policies

Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Teleflex Incorporated and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). Intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but not a controlling equity interest, including variable interest entities for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary, are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in affiliates over which the Company does not have significant influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and reflect management’s estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts.

During the fourth quarter 2017, the Company changed some of its operating segments as a result of an integration program under which it is combining the businesses of Vascular Solutions, Inc. ("Vascular Solutions"), which the Company acquired in February 2017, with certain other legacy businesses. These changes also reflect the manner in which the Company’s new chief operating decision maker assesses business performance and allocation of resources. All prior comparative periods have been restated to reflect these changes. See Note 16 for additional information on the changes to the Company's operating segments.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents:

All highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates the current market value.

Accounts receivable:

Accounts receivable represent amounts due from customers related to the sale of products and provision of services. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained and represents the Company’s estimate of the amount of uncollectible receivables. The allowance is provided at such time as management believes reasonable doubt exists that such balances will be collected within a reasonable period of time. The allowance is based on the Company’s historical collection experience with respect to the customer, the length of time an account is outstanding, the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services. In addition, the Company maintains a reserve for returns and allowances based on its historical experience. See

Note 9

for information on the Company’s concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable, as well as the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of the Company’s inventories is determined using the average cost method. Elements of cost in inventory include raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. In estimating net realizable value, the Company evaluates inventory for excess and obsolete quantities based on estimated usage and sales, among other factors.

Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred to develop internal-use computer software during the application development stage generally are capitalized. Costs of enhancements to internal-use computer software are capitalized, provided that these enhancements result in additional functionality. Other additions and those improvements which increase the capacity or lengthen the useful lives of the assets are also capitalized. Composite useful lives for categories of property, plant and equipment, which are depreciated on a straight-line basis, are as follows: buildings —

30 years

; machinery and equipment —


to

10 years

; computer equipment and software —


to

5 years

. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the useful lives of the leasehold improvements or the remaining lease term. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and other intangible assets:

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Impairment losses, if any, are included in income from operations. The goodwill impairment test is applied to each of the Company’s reporting units. For purposes of this assessment, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business one level below an operating segment (also known as a component) if discrete

F-10

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

financial information is prepared for that business and regularly reviewed by segment management. However, separate components are aggregated as a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics.

In applying the goodwill impairment test, the Company may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company’s products and services, regulatory and political developments, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company proceeds to a two-step quantitative impairment test, described below. Alternatively, the Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the two-step quantitative impairment test. The first step of the two-step impairment test is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. If the reporting unit fair value exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. If the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value, the Company would perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test, in which the Company would measure the amount of an impairment loss, if any, based on the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit's identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially.  The Company did not record a goodwill impairment charge for the year ended

December 31, 2017

.

The Company’s intangible assets consist of customer relationships, intellectual property, distribution rights, in-process research and development ("IPR&D") and trade names. The Company defines IPR&D as the value of technology acquired for which the related projects have substance and are incomplete. IPR&D acquired in a business acquisition is recognized at fair value and is required be capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until completion of the IPR&D project or upon abandonment. Upon completion of the development project (generally when regulatory approval to market the product that utilizes the technology is obtained), an impairment assessment is performed prior to amortizing the asset over its estimated useful life. If the IPR&D projects are abandoned, the related IPR&D assets would be written off.

The Company tests its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Similar to the goodwill impairment test process, the Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, the asset is not impaired. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, the Company then proceeds to a quantitative impairment test, which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount.  The Company did not record an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge for the year ended

December 31, 2017

.

Intangible assets consisting of intellectual property, customer relationships, distribution rights, trade names and noncompete agreement do not have indefinite lives and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives, which are as follows: intellectual property,


to

20 years

; customer relationships,


to

27 years

; distribution rights,


to

17 years

; trade names,


to

30 years

; noncompete agreements,


to


years . The weighted average remaining amortization period with respect to the Company's intangible assets is approximately


years. The Company periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets.

Long-lived assets:

The Company assesses the remaining useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The assessment is based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow and profitability projections that incorporate, as applicable, the impact on the existing business.  Therefore, the evaluation involves significant management judgment. Any impairment loss, if indicated, is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.

Foreign currency translation:

Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with non-United States dollar denominated functional currencies are translated into United States dollars at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date; income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Derivative financial instruments:

The Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. All instruments are entered into for other than

F-11

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

trading purposes. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as other comprehensive income (loss), if the instrument is designated as part of a hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to the consolidated statement of income in the period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item. Gains or losses on derivative instruments representing hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, if any, are recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the period in which such gains and losses occur. If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur, gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recorded in the consolidated statement of income for the period in which either such event occurs.  For non-designated derivatives, gains and losses are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income. The receipt or payment of funds upon settlement of derivative financial instruments is classified as cash flows from operating activities.

Share-based compensation:

The Company estimates the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest, which is derived, in part, in consideration of estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. Share-based compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account subjective and complex assumptions with respect to the expected life of the options, volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. The expected life of options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award, as well as historical exercise behavior, and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase the Company’s common stock, which the Company believes is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than would be the case if the Company only used historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on United States (or "U.S.") Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option.  Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on management’s expectations regarding the extent to which awards ultimately will vest and are adjusted for actual forfeitures when they occur.

Income taxes:

The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases, and to reflect operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Provision has been made for income taxes on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and affiliates, except to the extent that such earnings are deemed to be permanently reinvested.

Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. The Company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Interest accrued with respect to unrecognized tax benefits and income tax related penalties are both included in taxes on income from continuing operations. The Company periodically assesses the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjusts the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to an adjustment become known.

Pensions and other postretirement benefits:

The Company provides a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including under plans that provide pension and postretirement healthcare benefits. The Company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. The effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods.

Restructuring costs:

Restructuring costs, which include termination benefits, facility closure costs, contract termination costs and other restructuring costs are recorded at estimated fair value. Key assumptions used in calculating the restructuring costs include the terms of, and payments under, agreements to terminate certain contractual obligations and the timing of reductions in force.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Contingent consideration related to business acquisitions:

In connection with business acquisitions, the Company may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives such as receipt of regulatory approval, commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets. As of the acquisition date, the Company records a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration that it expects to pay.  The Company remeasures the fair value of its contingent consideration arrangements each reporting period and, based on new developments, records changes in fair value until either the contingent consideration obligation is satisfied through payment upon the achievement of, or the obligation no longer exists due to the failure to achieve, the specified objectives.  The change in the fair value is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income. A contingent consideration payment is classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows to the extent it was recorded as a liability as of the acquisition date. Any additional amount paid in excess of the amount initially accrued is classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Revenue recognition:

The Company recognizes revenues from product sales, including sales to distributors, or services provided when the following revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. This generally occurs when products are shipped, when services are rendered or upon customers’ acceptance. Revenues are net of estimated returns and other allowances, including rebates.

The Company’s normal policy is to accept returns only in cases in which the product is defective and covered under the Company’s standard warranty provisions. With respect to the limited cases where an arrangement provides a right of return to the customer, including a distributor, the Company believes it has the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on its substantial historical experience with respect to these arrangements.  Revenues and cost of goods sold are reduced to reflect estimated returns. The reserve for returns and allowances was

$4.2 million

and

$4.4 million

as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

Allowances related to customer incentive programs, which include discounts or rebates, are estimated and provided for in the period that the related revenues are recorded.  These allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also offers rebates to certain distributors and records the estimated rebate as a reduction of revenue at the time of sale. In estimating rebates, the Company considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor’s rebate claim, distributor-specific trend analyses, contractual commitments, including stated rebate rates, historical experience with respect to specific customers and other relevant information. The Company adjusts estimated rebates based on actual experience and records the adjustment to revenue in the period of adjustment.  The reserve for the customer incentive programs, including distributor rebates, was

$12.2 million

and

$11.6 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. The Company expects the amounts subject to the reserve as of

December 31, 2017

to be paid within 90 days subsequent to year-end.

Recently issued accounting standards

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), in a joint effort with the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"), issued new accounting guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue. This new guidance, collectively with related guidance provided by the FASB, is designed to enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets, and will affect any entity that enters into contracts with customers or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. The new guidance establishes principles for reporting information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those years.  The Company adopted the new standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method of adoption, which involves recognizing the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance as an adjustment to the Company's opening balance of retained earnings on the adoption date.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that will change the requirements for accounting for leases. Under the new guidance, lessees (including lessees under leases classified as finance leases, which are to be classified based on criteria similar to that applicable to capital leases under current guidance, and leases classified as operating

F-13

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

leases) will recognize a right-to-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet, initially measured as the present value of lease payments under the lease. Under current guidance, operating leases are not recognized on the balance sheet.  The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements; the guidance provides certain practical expedients. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine its impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance designed to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including, among other things, guidance related to accounting for income taxes, modification of the criteria for classification of awards as either equity awards or liability awards where an employer withholds shares from an employee's share-based award for tax withholding purposes, and classification on the statement of cash flows of cash payments to a tax authority by an employer that withholds shares from an employee's award for tax withholding purposes. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2017. The Company has applied the new guidance requiring recognition of excess tax deficiencies and tax benefits in the consolidated statement of income, rather than in additional paid-in-capital, as previously required. The adoption of the new standard increased net income and cash flows from operating activities by

$6.6 million

and increased diluted earnings per share by

$0.14

for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company will continue to estimate forfeitures of share-based awards at the time of grant, rather than recognize actual forfeitures as they occur, as permitted under the new guidance.

In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance with regard to eight specific issues pertaining to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2018. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on its cash flows.

In October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance requiring companies to recognize the income tax effects of intra-entity sales and transfers of assets, other than inventory, in the income statement as income tax expense (or benefit) in the period in which the transfer occurs. Previously, recognition was prohibited until the assets were sold to an outside party or otherwise utilized.  The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual period of adoption.   The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2018.  The adoption of the guidance did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance to clarify the definition of a “business,” with the objective of assisting entities in evaluating whether a transaction should be accounted for as an acquisition (or disposal) of assets or as an acquisition of a business. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting, including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill and consolidation. The guidance generally defines a business as an integrated set of activities and assets (collectively referred to as a “set”) that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors or other owners, members, or participants. The guidance further provides that, to be considered a business, a set must meet specified requirements. However, the guidance also states that, if substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired (subject to specified exceptions) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not considered a business and no further analysis is required. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The guidance permits early adoption, and the Company adopted this guidance during the fourth quarter 2017. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the quantitative test for goodwill impairment.  Under current guidance, if a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, the entity must determine the implied value of goodwill. This determination is made by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit’s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole as if the reporting unit had just been acquired. Under the new guidance, a determination of the implied value of goodwill will no longer be required; a goodwill impairment will be equal to the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.  The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and any interim goodwill impairment tests within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017.  The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance, but currently does not anticipate the guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In March 2017, the FASB issued guidance for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plans.  The guidance requires that these employers disaggregate specified components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost (collectively, "net benefit cost"). Specifically, the

F-14

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

guidance generally requires employers to present in the income statement the service cost component of net benefit cost in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 and generally is required to be applied retrospectively. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2018.  The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance with the objective of improving the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity's risk management activities in its financial statements.  The new guidance provides for changes to current designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and to the method of presenting hedge results. In addition, the new guidance includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The new guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated results of operations and financial position.

In February 2018, the FASB issued an amendment to the guidance on comprehensive income. The amendment permits a company to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("the TCJA") on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The amendment also requires certain new disclosures about these stranded tax effects. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The new guidance can be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the 2017 Act is recognized. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

From time to time, new accounting guidance is issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that is adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date or, when permitted by the guidance and as determined by the Company, as of an earlier date. The Company has assessed recently issued guidance that is not yet effective and believes the new guidance will not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

Vascular Solutions, Inc.

On February 17, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition, via a merger transaction, of Vascular Solutions, a medical device company that has developed and marketed products for use in minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures. In connection with the merger, subject to specified exclusions, each share of common stock of Vascular Solutions (each, a "Share" and collectively, the “Shares”) was converted into the right to receive

$56.00

per Share in cash, without interest and subject to applicable withholding tax. In addition, each outstanding option or similar right to purchase Shares issued under the Vascular Solutions’ Stock Option and Stock Award Plan (the "Company Options") was cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the acquisition and (ii) the excess, if any, of

$56.00

over the exercise price of such Company Option. The aggregate consideration paid by the Company in connection with the merger was approximately

$975.5 million

, net of cash acquired.

For the years ended

December 31, 2017

in cash less a favorable working capital adjustment of

$1.4 million

(for which the Company had not yet received payment as of December 31, 2017) and

$251.0 million

in estimated fair value of contingent consideration.  The contingent consideration liability represents the estimated fair value of the Company's obligations, under the acquisition agreement, to make four milestone payments of up to

$375 million

in the aggregate if certain sales goals are met.  The milestone payments are based on net sales (as defined in the acquisition agreement) for the periods from January 1, 2018 through April 30, 2018 and the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020.  The fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated using a Monte Carlo valuation approach.

Restructuring Charges

2017 Vascular Solutions Integration Program

During the first quarter 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring program related to the integration of Vascular Solutions into Teleflex.  The program commenced in the first quarter 2017, and the Company expects the program to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter 2018.  The Company estimates that it will record aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of

$6.5 million

to

$8.0 million

related to this program, of which,

$5.5 million

to

$6.2 million

will constitute termination benefits, and

$1.0 million

to

$1.8 million

will relate to other exit costs, including employee relocation and outplacement costs.  Additionally, the Company expects to incur

$2.5 million

to

$3.0 million

of restructuring related charges, consisting primarily of retention bonuses offered to certain employees expected to remain with the Company after completion of the program.  All of these charges will result in future cash outlays.  As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company has a restructuring reserve of $

2.1 million

related to this program.

2017 EMEA Restructuring Program

During the first quarter 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring program to centralize certain administrative functions in Europe. The program commenced in the second quarter 2017, and the Company expects the program to be substantially completed by the end of 2018.  The Company estimates that it will record aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately

$5.0 million

related to this program, almost all of which constitute termination benefits, and all of which will result in future cash outlays.  This represents a decrease as compared to the prior estimate of aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of

$7.1 million

to

$8.5 million

as a result of a decrease in the headcount reduction initially contemplated under the program.  As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company has a restructuring reserve of

$4.9 million

related to this program.

2016 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan

In 2016, the Company initiated a restructuring plan involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations, the relocation and outsourcing of certain distribution operations and a related workforce reduction at certain of the Company's facilities (the “2016 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan"). These actions commenced in the first quarter 2016 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2018.

The Company estimates that it will incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring and restructuring related charges in connection with the 2016 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan of between approximately

$34 million

to

$44 million

, of which an estimated $

27 million

to $

31 million

are expected to result in future cash outlays. Most of these charges, and the related cash outlays, are expected to be made prior to the end of 2018.

2014 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan

In April 2014, the Company initiated a restructuring plan (the "2014 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan") involving the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain facilities, and the relocation of manufacturing operations from certain higher-cost locations to existing lower-cost locations. These actions commenced in the second quarter 2014.

During the fourth quarter 2017, the Company executed an agreement with an alternate provider for the development and supply of a component to be included in certain kits primarily sold by the Company’s Vascular and Anesthesia North America operating segments.  The agreement will result in increased development costs, but is expected to reduce the cost of the component supply, once the supply becomes commercially available, as compared to costs incurred with respect to current suppliers.  As a result, the Company revised its cost and timing estimates with respect to the 2014 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan.  The Company estimates that it will incur aggregate pre-tax charges in connection with the 2014 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan of

$46 million

to

$51 million

, compared to the Company’s prior estimate of approximately

$43 million

to

$48 million

, compared to its prior estimate of

$33 million

to

$38 million

.  Additionally, the Company continues to expect that it will incur

$24 million

to

$30 million

in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan.  Most of these charges and cash outlays are expected to be incurred prior to 2020, and the Company expects, as a result of the changes described above, the program will now be substantially complete by the end of 2021, compared to its prior estimate of the second half of 2020.

The following table provides a summary of the Company’s cost estimates by major type of expense associated with the 2014 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan, which reflect the revised estimates:

(1)

Includes contract termination costs as well as facility closure and other exit costs (employee relocation costs, equipment relocation costs and outplacement).

(2)

Consists of accelerated depreciation and other costs directly related to the plan, primarily as a result of the transfer of manufacturing operations to new locations.

As the 2014 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan progresses, management will reevaluate the estimated expenses and charges set forth above, and may revise its estimates, as appropriate, consistent with GAAP.

The following table summarizes the activity related to the 2014 Manufacturing Footprint Realignment Plan restructuring reserve:

For the years ended

December 31, 2017

, 2016 and 2015, the Company reported restructuring related costs  of

$4.0 million

,

$8.5 million

and

$9.5 million

, respectively, related to this plan within cost of goods sold. These costs related to accelerated depreciation and certain other costs, primarily for the transfer of manufacturing operations from the existing locations to the new locations in connection with the plan.

As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company has incurred net aggregate restructuring expenses related to the plan of

$11.8 million

.

Additionally, as of

December 31, 2017

, the Company has incurred net aggregate accelerated depreciation and certain other costs in connection with the plan of

$26.9 million

, which were included in cost of goods sold.

2016 Other Restructuring Programs

During 2016, the Company commenced restructuring activities involving the consolidation of certain global administrative functions and manufacturing operations (the "Other 2016 Restructuring Programs"). The programs are expected to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter 2018.  The Company estimates that it will record aggregate pre-tax restructuring expenses of

$3.8 million

to

$4.7 million

related to these programs, which constitute termination benefits and contract termination costs that will result in cash outlays. Additionally, the Company expects to incur approximately

$1.5 million

of restructuring related costs, including accelerated depreciation and other costs directly related to these programs and anticipates that these costs will be recognized as cost of goods sold; the Company

F-22

anticipates that approximately

$1.0 million

of this amount will result in cash outlays. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has a reserve of

$0.7 million

related to these programs.

As each of these plans and programs progress, management will reevaluate the estimated expenses set forth above, and may revise its estimates, as appropriate, consistent with GAAP.

As of

December 31, 2017

, trade names having a carrying value of

$236.1 million

are considered indefinite-lived. Acquired IPR&D is indefinite-lived until the completion of the related development project, at which point amortization of the carrying value of the technology will commence.  See Note 3 for additional details regarding intangible assets acquired during 2017.

During the fourth quarter 2017, the Company reassessed the useful life of one of its trade names as a result of increased competition experienced in the product categories utilizing it.  The trade name, which had a carrying value of

$57.1 million

as of December 31, 2017, was reclassified from an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset and will be amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of


years.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized a

$41.0 million

pre-tax impairment charge (

$26.1 million

after tax) resulting from the discontinuation of research and development efforts associated with an IPR&D project.

Borrowings

The Company's borrowings at

December 31, 2017

and


were as follows:

Amended and restated senior credit facility

On January 20, 2017, the Company amended and restated its then existing senior credit agreement by entering into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which provides for a

five

year revolving credit facility of

$1.0 billion

and a term loan facility of

$750.0 million

(the "Credit Agreement").  The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed (subject to certain exceptions and limitations) by substantially all of the material domestic subsidiaries of the Company and are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets owned by the Company and each guarantor.  The maturity date of the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement is January 20, 2022, and the term loan facility will mature on February 17, 2022.

At the Company’s option, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from

1.25%

to

2.50%

or at an alternate base rate, which generally is defined as the highest of (i) the publicly announced prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement, (ii)

0.5%

above the federal funds rate and (iii)

1%

above adjusted LIBOR for a one month interest period, plus an applicable margin ranging from

0.25%

to

1.50%

, in each case subject to adjustment based on the Company’s consolidated total leverage ratio (generally, Consolidated Total Funded Indebtedness, as defined in the Credit Agreement, on the date of determination to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the date of determination).  Overdue loans will bear interest at the rate otherwise applicable to such loans plus

2.00%

.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Credit Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, place limitations on the Company and its subsidiaries regarding its ability, and the ability of its subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, create additional liens, enter into a merger, consolidation or amalgamation, dispose of certain assets, make certain investments or acquisitions, pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements.  The Company is required to maintain a total consolidated leverage ratio of not more than

4.50

to 1.00 and a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio (generally, Consolidated Senior Secured Funded Indebtedness, as defined in the Credit Agreement, on the date of determination to Consolidated EBITDA for the four most recent quarters ending on or preceding the date of determination) of not more than

3.50

to 1.00. The Company is further required to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (generally, Consolidated EBITDA for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the date of determination to Consolidated Interest Expense, as defined in the Credit Agreement, paid in cash for such period) of not less than

3.50

to 1.00.

The Company capitalized

$11.8 million

related to transaction fees, including underwriters’ discounts and commissions, incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement, of which,

$6.8 million

related to the revolving credit agreement and was recognized in other assets within the Company's consolidated balance sheet.  In addition, because the Company's entry into the Credit Agreement was considered a partial extinguishment of the indebtedness under its previously outstanding credit agreement, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of

$0.4 million

during the first quarter 2017.

As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the Company had outstanding irrevocable standby letters of credit of approximately

$3.2 million

with various third parties. The letters of credit reduced the amount of available funds under the revolving credit facility by an equal amount.

Convertible Notes

The Company’s

3.875%

Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017 (the “Convertible Notes”) matured on August 1, 2017 (the “Maturity Date”). During 2017, prior to and on the Maturity Date, the Company engaged in the transactions described below.

Exchange Transactions

On January 5, 2017, pursuant to separate, privately negotiated agreements between the Company and certain holders of the Convertible Notes, the Company paid cash and common stock (the "Exchange Consideration") to the holders in exchange for

$91.7 million

aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes (the "Exchange Transactions").  The Exchange Consideration paid to each of the holders per

$1,000

principal amount of Convertible Notes was equal to: (i)

$1,000

in cash, (ii) a number of shares of the Company's common stock equal to the amount of the conversion value of the Convertible Notes in excess of the

$1,000

principal amount (the "Conversion Shares"), calculated on the basis of the average daily volume weighted average price per share of Company common stock over a specified period (the "Average Daily VWAP"), (iii) an inducement payment in additional shares of common stock (the "Inducement Shares"), calculated based on the Average Daily VWAP; and (iv) cash in an amount equal to accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the closing date.  As a result of the Exchange Transactions, the Company paid the holders aggregate cash consideration of approximately

$93.2 million

(which includes approximately

$1.5 million

in accrued but previously unpaid interest) and issued and delivered to the holders approximately

0.93 million

shares of Company common stock (including both Conversion Shares and Inducement Shares). The Company funded the

$93.2 million

cash payment constituting part of the Exchange Consideration through borrowings under its revolving credit facility.  As a result of the Exchange Transactions, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of

$5.2 million

during the first quarter 2017.

In connection with its entry into the Exchange Transactions, the Company also entered into bond hedge unwind agreements (the "Hedge Unwind Agreements") and warrant unwind agreements (the "Warrant Unwind Agreements") with the dealer counterparties to convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions that were effected at the time of the initial issuance of the Convertible Notes. Under the Hedge Unwind Agreements, the number of then-outstanding call options issued to the Company under the Convertible Note hedge transactions (the "Call Options") was reduced to reflect proportionately the reduction in the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes following the Exchange Transactions. Under the Warrant Unwind Agreements, the number of warrants then held by the dealer counterparties also was reduced. On a net basis, after giving effect to the Hedge Unwind Agreements and Warrant Unwind Agreements, the Company received

0.12 million

shares of Company common stock from the dealer counterparties.

Securitization Program

The Company has an accounts receivable securitization facility under which accounts receivable of certain domestic subsidiaries are sold on a non-recourse basis to a special purpose entity (“SPE”), which is a bankruptcy-remote, consolidated subsidiary of Teleflex. Accordingly, the assets of the SPE are not available to satisfy the obligations of Teleflex or any of its subsidiaries. The SPE sells undivided interests in those receivables to an asset backed commercial paper conduit for consideration of up to

$50.0 million

.  This facility is utilized from time to time to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements. The agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events. An occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of its counterparty to terminate this facility. As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company was in compliance with the covenants, and none of the termination events had occurred.  As of

December 31, 2017

Fair Value of Long-Term Debt

The carrying amount of current and long-term borrowings as reported in the consolidated balance sheet as of

$2.2 billion

. To determine the fair value of its debt for which quoted prices are not available, the Company uses a discounted cash flow technique that incorporates a market interest yield curve with adjustments for duration, optionality and risk profile. The Company’s implied credit rating is a factor in determining the market interest yield curve. The following table provides the fair value of the Company’s debt as of

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

The Company uses derivative instruments for risk management purposes. Foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flows hedges are used to manage foreign currency transaction exposure.  Foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are used to manage exposure related to near term foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities.  The Company enters into the non-designated foreign currency forward contracts for periods consistent with its currency translation exposures, which generally approximate one month.  For the years ended

Concentration of Credit Risk

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are generally limited due to the Company’s large number of customers and their diversity across many geographic areas. However, a portion of the Company’s trade accounts receivable outside the United States include sales to government-owned or supported healthcare systems in several countries which are subject to payment delays. Payment is dependent upon the creditworthiness of the healthcare systems in those countries and the financial stability of their economies.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company grants non-interest bearing trade credit to its customers on normal credit terms. In an effort to reduce its credit risk, the Company (i) establishes credit limits for all of its customer relationships, (ii) performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition, (iii) monitors the payment history and aging of its customers’ receivables, and (iv) monitors open orders against an individual customer’s outstanding receivable balance.  An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for trade accounts receivable based on expected collectability of accounts receivable, considering the Company's historical collection experience, the length of time an account is outstanding, the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services. The adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary. The allowance for doubtful accounts was

$10.3 million

and

$8.6 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.  The current portion of the allowance for doubtful accounts at

December 31, 2017

and


of

$3.5 million

and

$2.0 million

, respectively, was reported in accounts receivable, net within the consolidated balance sheet. The allowance for doubtful accounts on receivables outstanding for greater than one year at

December 31, 2017

and


of

$6.8 million

and

$6.6 million

, respectively, is recognized in other assets within the consolidated balance sheet.

Certain of the Company’s customers, particularly in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided, raising collectability concerns regarding the Company’s trade accounts receivable from these customers. As a result, the Company continues to closely monitor the allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to these customers and uses other risk mitigation strategies such as selling receivables. The aggregate net current and long-term trade accounts receivable for customers in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal and the percentage of the Company’s total net current and long-term trade accounts receivable represented by the net current and long-term trade accounts receivable for customers in those countries at

Fair value measurement

Fair value is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability, using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The FASB's fair value guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy of the inputs (i.e., assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability) used to measure fair value. The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the entire fair value measurement.

The levels of inputs within the hierarchy used to measure fair value are as follows:

Level 1 — inputs to the fair value measurement that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 — inputs to the fair value measurement that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

F-31

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED

There were no transfers of financial assets or liabilities among Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy during the years ended

Valuation Techniques

The Company’s financial assets valued based upon Level 1 inputs are comprised of investments in marketable securities held in trust, which are available to satisfy benefit obligations under Company benefit plans and other arrangements. The investment assets of the trust are valued using quoted market prices.

The Company’s financial assets and liabilities valued based upon Level 2 inputs are comprised of foreign currency forward contracts. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency transaction exposure as well as exposure to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The Company measures the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts by calculating the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities, based on quoted market prices, and taking into account the creditworthiness of the counterparties.

The Company’s financial liabilities valued based upon Level 3 inputs are comprised of contingent consideration arrangements pertaining to the Company’s acquisitions.   See

Note 8

for a discussion of the fair value of the Company’s borrowings.

Contingent consideration

As of December 31, 2017, the Company estimates that contingent consideration payments will occur in 2018 through 2029 and the maximum amount of undiscounted payments the Company could make under contingent consideration arrangements is

$401.8 million

.  The contingent consideration liabilities, which primarily consist of revenue-based milestones, are remeasured to fair value each reporting period using assumptions including estimated revenues  (based on internal operational budgets and long-range strategic plans), discount rates, probability of payment and project payment dates.

The contingent consideration fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and therefore constitute Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.  The Company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the NeoTract acquisition using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation approach, which simulates future revenues during the earn out-period using management's best estimates.  The Company determines the value of its other contingent consideration liabilities based on a probability-weighted discounted cash

flow analysis.  Increases in projected revenues and probabilities of payment may result in significantly higher fair value measurements; decreases in these items may have the opposite effect.  Increases in the discount rates and the period prior to payment may result in significantly lower fair value measurements; decreases in these items may have the opposite effect.

The table below provides additional information regarding the valuation technique and inputs used in determining the fair value of contingent consideration recognized in connection with the NeoTract acquisition, which is described in Note 3.

Shareholders' equity

The authorized capital of the Company is comprised of

200 million

common shares,

$1

par value, and

500,000

preference shares. No preference shares have been outstanding during the last three years.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed in the same manner except that the weighted average number of shares is increased to include dilutive securities. The following table provides a reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares outstanding:

Weighted average shares that were antidilutive and therefore not included in the calculation of earnings per share were approximately

0.6 million

,

3.4 million

and

5.6 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


, respectively.

Prior to the Maturity Date of the Convertible Notes and during periods in which the average market price of the Company's common stock was above the conversion price of the Convertible Notes, or

$61.32

per share, the impact of conversion was dilutive and the dilutive effect of conversion of the Convertibles Notes is reflected in diluted earnings per share.  The Company elected the net settlement method of accounting for these conversions, under which the Company settled the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash, and settled the excess conversion value in shares.  In periods prior to the Maturity Date where the average market price of the Company's common stock was above

$61.32

per share, under the treasury stock method, the Company calculated the number of shares issuable

F-33

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

under the terms of the Convertible Notes based on the average market price of its common stock during the period, and included that number in the total diluted shares outstanding for the period.

In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge and warrant agreements. The convertible note hedge agreements economically reduced the dilutive impact of the Convertible Notes. However, applicable accounting guidance requires the Company to separately analyze the impact of the warrant agreements on diluted weighted average shares outstanding, without giving effect to the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedge agreements. The reductions in diluted shares that would have resulted from giving effect to the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedge agreements are

0.3 million

,

2.0 million

, and

3.3 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


, respectively. The treasury stock method is applied when the exercise price of the warrants is less than the average of the market prices during the period and assumes the proceeds from the exercise of the warrants are used to repurchase shares based on the average stock price during the period. The exercise price of the warrants is approximately

$74.65

per share of common stock. Shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants that were included in the total diluted shares outstanding were

Stock compensation plans

In May of 2014, the stockholders of the Company approved the Teleflex Incorporated 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan") which replaced the Company's 2008 Stock Incentive Plan and 2000 Stock Compensation Plan (the "Prior Plans"), under which stock options and restricted stock awards previously were granted.  The 2014 Plan provides for several different kinds of awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards and other stock-based awards to directors, officers and key employees. Under the 2014 Plan, the Company is authorized to issue up to

5.3 million

shares of common stock, subject to adjustment in accordance with special share counting rules in the 2014 Plan that, among other things, (i) count shares underlying a stock option or stock appreciation right (each, an "option award") as

one

share and each share underlying any other type of award (a "stock award") as

1.8

shares, (ii) increases the shares the Company is authorized to issue by

one

or

1.8

shares for each share underlying an option award or stock award, respectively, under the Prior Plans that have been canceled, expired, settled in cash or forfeited after December 31, 2013 and (iii) decrease the number of shares the Company is authorized to issue by

one

share and

1.8

shares for each share underlying an option award or stock award, respectively, granted under the Prior Plans between January 1, 2014 and the May 2, 2014 adoption of the 2014 Plan by the Company's stockholders. Options granted under the 2014 Plan have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant. In 2017, the Company granted non-qualified options to purchase

260,171

shares of common stock and granted restricted stock units relating to

82,865

shares of common stock under the 2014 Plan. The unrecognized compensation expense for these awards as of the grant date was

Income taxes

The following table summarizes the components of the provision for income taxes from continuing operations:

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, permanently reducing corporate income tax rates from a maximum of 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018;  implementing a territorial tax system, by generally providing for, among other things, a dividends received deduction on the foreign source portion of dividends received from a foreign corporation if specified conditions are met; and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed post-1986 foreign subsidiary earnings and profits, which are deemed repatriated for purposes of the tax.

As a result of the TCJA, the Company reassessed and revalued its ending net deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2017 and recognized a

$46.1 million

provisional tax benefit in the Company’s consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.

As a result of the deemed repatriation tax under the TCJA, the Company recognized a

$154.0 million

provisional tax expense in the Company’s consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017, and  the Company expects to pay this tax over an

eight

-year period.

While the TCJA provides for a territorial tax system, beginning in 2018, it includes two new U.S. tax base erosion provisions, the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions and the base-erosion and anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) provisions.

The GILTI provisions require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. The Company expects that it will be subject to incremental U.S. tax on GILTI income beginning in 2018.   Because of the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, the Company is continuing to evaluate this provision of the TCJA and the application of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, "Income Taxes." Under U.S. GAAP, the Company may make an accounting policy election to either (1) treat future taxes with respect to the inclusion in U.S. taxable income of amounts related to GILTI as current period expense when incurred (the “period cost method”) or (2) take such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (the “deferred method”). The Company’s selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new GILTI tax rules will depend, in part, on an analysis of the Company’s global income to determine whether the Company expects to have future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI and, if so, what the impact is expected to be. The determination of whether the Company expects to have future U.S. inclusions

F-37

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in taxable income related to GILTI depends not only on the Company’s current structure and estimated future operating results but also the Company’s ability and willingness to modify its structure and/or its business.  As such, the Company is not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of this provision of the TCJA. Therefore, the Company has not made any adjustments related to potential GILTI tax in its financial statements and has not made a policy decision regarding whether to record deferred taxes on GILTI.

The BEAT provisions in the TCJA eliminate the deduction of certain base-erosion payments made to related foreign corporations, and impose a minimum tax if greater than regular tax. While the Company’s analysis of the BEAT provisions is not fully completed, the Company does not currently believe it will be subject to the BEAT provisions in 2018 and has not recorded any tax impacts of BEAT in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA. SAB 118 states that in these circumstances, if the company can determine a reasonable estimate for the income tax effects, the SEC staff would not object if the company includes in its financial statements the reasonable estimate it has determined (and the SEC staff also expressed its belief that it would not be appropriate for a company to exclude a reasonable estimate from its financial statements to the extent a reasonable estimate has been determined). The Company has recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions the Company may take as a result of the TCJA.

At

December 31, 2017

, the cumulative unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside the United States that are considered non-permanently reinvested and for which taxes have been provided approximated

was impacted by a net tax expense of

$107.9 million

resulting from the enactment of the TCJA.  The

$107.9 million

net tax expense reflects a tax expense of

$154.0 million

for the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings partially offset by a

$46.1 million

tax benefit resulting from the reassessment and revaluation of the net deferred tax liabilities.  Additionally, the effective tax rate for 2017 was impacted by a net excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation and a benefit resulting from the expiration of various statutes of limitation.

F-38

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The effective income tax rate for


was impacted by a tax benefit associated with U.S. federal tax return filings, a benefit resulting from the reduction of our German reserves as a result of the conclusion of an audit, a benefit resulting from the expiration of various statutes of limitation, and a benefit associated with the IP R&D asset impairment referenced in Note 4.

The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to examinations by various taxing authorities. In conjunction with these examinations and as a regular practice, the Company establishes and adjusts reserves with respect to its uncertain tax positions to address developments related to those positions. The Company realized a net benefit of approximately

$5.2 million

in 2017 as a result of reducing its reserves with respect to uncertain tax positions, principally due to the expiration of a number of applicable statutes of limitations. The Company realized a net benefit of approximately

$8.8 million

in 2016, as a result of reducing its reserves with respect to uncertain tax positions, principally due to the conclusion of a tax audit in Germany and the expiration of various statutes of limitations.  The Company realized a net benefit of approximately

$4.6 million

in 2015, which resulted from a reduction in the Company's U.S. reserves due to the conclusion of a tax audit, offset by an increase in the Company's foreign reserves with respect to developments in the tax audit in Germany discussed above.

The following table summarizes significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities at

December 31, 2017

and


:

As a result of the TCJA, the Company reassessed and revalued its deferred tax positions at December 31, 2017.  As a result, the Company recognized a

$46.1 million

decrease in the net deferred tax liability in 2017.

Under the tax laws of various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, deductions or credits that cannot be fully utilized for tax purposes during the current year may be carried forward, subject to statutory limitations, to reduce taxable income or taxes payable in a future tax year. At

December 31, 2017

, the tax effect of such carryforwards approximated

$210.1 million

. Of this amount,

$11.5 million

has no expiration date,

$2.0 million

expires after


but before the end of


and

$196.6 million

expires after


. A portion of these carryforwards consists of tax losses and credits obtained by the Company as a result of acquisitions; the utilization of these carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which limits a company’s ability to deduct prior net operating losses following a more than

50 percent

change in ownership.  It is not expected that the Section 382 limitation will prevent the Company ultimately from utilizing the applicable loss carryforwards. The determination of state net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon the United States subsidiaries’ taxable income or loss, the state’s proportion of each subsidiary's taxable net income and the application of state laws, which can change from year to year and impact the amount of such carryforward.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of

$104.8 million

and

$104.5 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the Company’s ability to utilize certain deferred tax

F-39

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which require that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The taxable years for which the applicable statute of limitations remains open by major tax jurisdictions are as follows:

The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to income tax examinations by various taxing authorities. As of

December 31, 2017

, the most significant tax examinations in process are in Canada, Germany, Italy, and the United States. The date at which these examinations may be concluded and the ultimate outcome of the examinations is uncertain. As a result of the uncertain outcome of these ongoing examinations, future examinations or the expiration of statutes of limitation, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken could

materially change from those recorded as liabilities at

Pension and other postretirement benefits

The Company has a number of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans covering eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The defined benefit pension plans are noncontributory. The benefits under these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees’ pay near retirement. The Company’s funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute annually, at a minimum, amounts required by applicable laws and regulations. Obligations

under non-U.S. plans are systematically provided for by depositing funds with trustees or by book reserves.  As of

December 31, 2017

, no further benefits are being accrued under the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans and the Company’s other postretirement benefit plans, other than certain postretirement benefit plans covering employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries provide medical, dental and life insurance benefits to pensioners or their survivors. The associated plans are unfunded and approved claims are paid from Company funds.

The following table provides the weighted average assumptions for United States and foreign plans used in determining benefit obligations:

The discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the Company’s pension and other benefit obligations. The weighted average discount rates for United States pension plans and other benefit plans of

3.76%

and

3.60%

, respectively, were established by comparing the projection of expected benefit payments to the AA Above Median yield curve as of

December 31, 2017

. The expected benefit payments are discounted by each corresponding discount rate on the yield curve. For payments beyond 30 years, the Company extends the curve assuming that the discount rate derived in year 30 is extended to the end of the plan’s payment expectations. Once the present value of the string of benefit payments is established, the Company determines the single rate on the yield curve that, when applied to all obligations of the plan, will exactly match the previously determined present value.

As part of the evaluation of pension and other postretirement assumptions, the Company applied assumptions for mortality and healthcare cost trends that incorporate generational white and blue collar mortality trends. In determining its benefit obligations, the Company used generational tables that take into consideration increases in plan participant longevity.

The Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is primarily based on the determination of an expected return for its current portfolio. This determination is made using assumptions for return and volatility of the portfolio. Asset class assumptions are set using a combination of empirical and forward-looking analysis. To the extent historical results have been affected by unsustainable trends or events, the effects of those trends are quantified and removed. The Company applies a variety of models for filtering historical data and isolating the fundamental characteristics of asset classes. These models provide empirical return estimates for each asset class, which are then reviewed and combined with a qualitative assessment of long term relationships between asset classes before a return estimate is finalized. The qualitative analysis is intended to provide an additional means for addressing the effect of unrealistic or unsustainable short-term valuations or trends, resulting in return levels and behavior the Company believes are more likely to prevail over long periods. Effective in 2018, the Company changed the expected return on plan assets of the United States pension plans from

8.25%

to

8.0%

due to modifications to the investment strategy in order to gradually reduce portfolio risk. This change had no impact on the results for the year ended December 31, 2017.

An increase in the assumed healthcare trend rate of 1% would increase the benefit obligation at

December 31, 2017

by

$3.6 million

and would increase the


benefit expense by

$0.2 million

. Decreasing this assumed rate by 1% would decrease the benefit obligation at

December 31, 2017

by

$3.1 million

and would decrease the


benefit expense by

$0.1 million

.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all United States and foreign defined benefit pension plans was

$461.6 million

and

$430.0 million

for


and


, respectively. All of the Company's pension plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of their respective plan assets as of

December 31, 2017

and


.

The Company’s investment objective is to achieve an enhanced long-term rate of return on plan assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the availability of benefits for participants. These investments are primarily comprised of equity and fixed income mutual funds. The Company’s other investments are largely comprised of a hedge fund of funds and a structured credit fund. The equity funds are diversified in terms of domestic and international equity securities, as well as small, middle and large capitalization stocks. The Company’s target allocation percentage is as follows: equity securities

(45%)

; fixed-income securities

(35%)

and other securities

(20%)

. Equity funds are held for their expected return over inflation. Fixed-income funds are held for diversification relative to equities and as a partial hedge of interest rate risk with respect to plan liabilities. The other investments are held to further diversify assets within the plans and are designed to provide a mix of equity and bond like return with

F-44

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

a bond like risk profile. The plans may also hold cash to meet liquidity requirements. Actual performance may not be consistent with the respective investment strategies. Investment risks and returns are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements and investment portfolio reviews to determine whether the asset allocation targets continue to represent an appropriate balance of expected risk and reward.

Environmental:

The Company is subject to contingencies as a result of environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require the Company to take further action to correct the effects on the environment of prior disposal practices or releases of chemical or petroleum substances by the Company or other parties. Much of this liability results from the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, often referred to as Superfund, the U. S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and similar state laws. These laws require the Company to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where the Company conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where Company-generated waste was disposed.

Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site. The nature of these activities, and their associated costs, depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, the regulatory agencies involved and their enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of other potentially responsible parties. At

During the first quarter 2017, Teleflex Medical Trading (Shanghai) Company, Ltd. (“Teleflex Shanghai”), one of the Company’s subsidiaries, eliminated a key distributor within its sales channel in China and undertook a distributor to direct sales conversion within that channel. On March 24, 2017, the distributor submitted an application with the Shanghai International Economy and Trade Arbitration Commission (“SHIAC”) for arbitration alleging, among other things, that Teleflex Shanghai wrongfully terminated its relationship with the distributor. Pursuant to a supplementary submission filed by the distributor with SHIAC in July 2017, the distributor sought to recover

$7.8 million

in damages, and also sought to compel Teleflex Shanghai to repurchase Teleflex products that the distributor claimed it purchased from Teleflex Shanghai at a total price of

$14.9 million

. Teleflex Shanghai filed a counterclaim seeking payment from the distributor of

$9.3 million

in respect of outstanding trade receivables owed by the distributor to Teleflex Shanghai.  In February 2018, Teleflex Shanghai and the distributor entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the outstanding claims of the parties.  Under the agreement, Teleflex Shanghai accepted the return of certain inventories from the distributor for

$11.9 million

during the fourth quarter 2017.  In connection with the return of the inventories, Teleflex Shanghai canceled

$9.3 million

in trade receivables owed by the distributor to Teleflex Shanghai.  The Company has recorded a provision of

$3.6 million

in connection with the settlement

.

In 2006, the Company was named as a defendant in a wrongful death product liability lawsuit filed in the Louisiana State District Court for the Parish of Calcasieu, involving a product manufactured by the Company’s former marine business.  In September 2014, the case was tried before a jury, which returned a verdict in favor of the Company.  The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion for a new trial, which was granted, and the case was re-tried before a jury in

F-48

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 2014.  On December 5, 2014, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, awarding

$0.1

million in compensatory damages and

$23.0 million

in punitive damages, plus pre- and post-judgment interest on the compensatory damages and post-judgment interest on the punitive damages. The Company's post-trial motions seeking to overturn the verdict or reduce the amount of damages were denied in June 2015. The Company filed an appeal with the Louisiana Court of Appeal, and the plaintiff filed a cross-appeal, seeking to overturn the trial court’s denial of pre-judgment interest on the punitive damages award. On June 29, 2016, the Louisiana Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court verdict in all respects. The Company and the plaintiff filed applications for a writ of certiorari (a request for review) to the Louisiana Supreme Court. On January 13, 2017, the Louisiana Supreme Court granted the Company's writ application, and oral arguments were held on May 1, 2017.  On October 18, 2017, the Louisiana Supreme Court issued its decision, affirming the lower court’s judgment in part and reducing the amount of punitive damages awarded to the plaintiff from

$23.0 million

to

$4.3 million

.  On November 10, 2017 the Company paid

$5.0 million

(inclusive of interest) in settlement of the litigation.

Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, established reserves and other resources, the Company does not believe that the outcome of any outstanding litigation and claims is likely to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to its business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, in the event of unexpected further developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, or other similar matters, if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Legal costs such as outside counsel fees and expenses are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses in the period incurred.

Tax audits and examinations:

The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to tax examinations by various tax authorities. As of

December 31, 2017

, the most significant tax examinations in process are in Canada, Germany, Italy, and the United States. The Company may establish reserves with respect to uncertain tax positions, after which it adjusts the reserves to address developments with respect to its uncertain tax positions, including developments in these tax examinations.  Accordingly, developments in tax audits and examinations, including resolution of uncertain tax positions, could result in increases or decreases to the Company’s recorded tax liabilities, which could impact the Company’s financial results.

Other:

The Company has various purchase commitments for materials, supplies and items of permanent investment incident to the ordinary conduct of business. On average, such commitments are not at prices in excess of current market prices.

Business segments and other information

An operating segment is a component of the Company (a) that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance, and (c) for which discrete financial information is available. The Company does not evaluate its operating segments using discrete asset information.

Following the Company's acquisition of Vascular Solutions, the Company commenced an integration program under which it is combining the Vascular Solutions business with some of its legacy businesses. Specifically, the Company is combining the Vascular Solutions North American business with the Company's interventional access business, which formerly was part of the Vascular North America operating segment, and the Company's cardiac business, which formerly was a separate operating segment included in the "all other" category for purposes of segment reporting.  These businesses are now in the Company's Interventional North America operating segment.  Additionally, the Company is combining the Vascular Solutions businesses in Europe, Asia and Latin America with the Company's legacy businesses in the respective locations, and these Vascular Solutions businesses are now part of the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), Asia and Latin America operating segments, respectively.  The changes in the Company’s operating segments, which became effective in the fourth quarter 2017, also reflect the manner in which the Company’s new chief operating decision maker assesses business performance and allocation of resources.

As a result of the operating segment changes described above, the Company has the following

seven

reportable segments: Vascular North America, Interventional North America, Anesthesia North America, Surgical North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), Asia and Original Equipment and Development Services ("OEM"). In connection with the presentation of segment information, we will continue to present certain operating segments, which now include Interventional Urology North America and Respiratory North America as well as Latin America, in the “all other” category because they are not material. All prior comparative periods presented have been restated to reflect

F-49

these changes.  Additionally, because these change affected certain of the Company's reporting units, the Company reallocated the goodwill balances using relative fair values of the reporting units and performed goodwill impairment analyses on the affected reporting units.  The Company did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of these analyses.

The Company’s reportable segments, other than the OEM segment, design, manufacture and distribute medical devices primarily used in critical care, surgical applications and cardiac care, and generally serve two end markets: hospitals and healthcare providers, and home health. The products of these segments are most widely used in the acute care setting for a range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and in general and specialty surgical applications. The Company’s OEM segment designs, manufactures and supplies devices and instruments for other medical device manufacturers.

The following tables present the Company’s segment results for the years ended

and


:

(1)

Segment operating profit includes segment net revenues from external customers reduced by its standard cost of goods sold, adjusted for fixed manufacturing cost absorption variances, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses and an allocation of corporate expenses.  Corporate expenses are allocated among the segments in proportion to the respective amounts of one of several items (such as sales, numbers of employees, and amount of time spent), depending on the category of expense involved.

(2)

Unallocated expenses primarily include manufacturing variances, with the exception of fixed manufacturing cost absorption variances, restructuring and impairment charges and gain on sale of assets.
