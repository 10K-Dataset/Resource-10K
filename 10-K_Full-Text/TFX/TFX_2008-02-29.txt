PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

Teleflex serves a wide variety of global customers by designing,
    manufacturing, and distributing specialty-engineered products. A
    diversified company distinguished by a significant presence in
    healthcare, Teleflex is a leading global supplier of disposable
    and single use medical products for critical care and surgical
    applications. Our medical products include devices used in
    critical care applications, surgical instruments, and cardiac
    assist devices for hospitals and healthcare providers, and
    instruments and devices delivered to medical device
    manufacturers. The company also serves the aerospace and
    commercial markets with engineered products and services
    designed to serve specialty or niche applications. Our aerospace
    products include engine repair products and services and
    cargo-handling systems and equipment used in commercial
    aviation. Our commercial products include marine driver
    controls, and engine assemblies and drive parts, power and fuel
    management systems and rigging products and services for
    commercial industries.

For more than 60 years, we have provided
    specialty-engineered products that help our customers meet their
    business requirements. We have grown through an active program
    of development of new products, introduction of products into
    new geographic or end-markets and through acquisitions of
    companies with related market, technology or industry expertise.
    We serve a diverse customer base in over 140 countries through
    our own operations and through local direct sales and
    distribution networks.

We have been focused on creating a portfolio of businesses that
    provides greater consistency of performance, improved
    profitability and sustainable growth. To accomplish this we have
    changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses to reduce
    cyclicality, improve margins and focus our resources on the
    development of our core businesses and carefully selected
    acquisitions.

We are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth
    through our internal growth initiatives which include the
    development of new products, expansion of market share, moving
    existing products into new geographies, and through selected
    acquisitions which enhance or expedite our development
    initiatives and our ability to grow market share.

The Teleflex portfolio of businesses changed significantly in
    2007 with acquisitions in all three business segments and
    significant divestitures in both Commercial and Aerospace.
    During 2007, in our Medical Segment, we completed the
    acquisition of Arrow International, a medical products company
    with annual revenues of over $500 million, which
    significantly expanded the Segment. We also completed the
    acquisition of a small orthopedic device manufacturer to expand
    our capability to serve medical device manufacturers. In our
    Commercial segment, we acquired a rigging services business with
    annual revenues of approximately $25 million. At the end of
    the fiscal year, we completed the divestiture of our automotive
    and industrial businesses with 2007 revenues of over
    $860 million, significantly reducing the size of our
    Commercial segment. In our Aerospace segment, we acquired a
    cargo equipment business with annual revenues of approximately
    $55 million and divested a precision — machined
    components business with approximately $130 million in
    annual revenues.

Our Business
    Segments

We organize our business into three business
    segments — Medical, Aerospace, and Commercial. For
    2007, the percentages of our consolidated net revenues
    represented by our segments were as follows: Medical —
    54 percent, Aerospace — 23 percent and
    Commercial — 23 percent. As a result of the Arrow
    acquisition, we anticipate that the Medical Segment will account
    for a larger percentage of revenue going forward.

Further detail and additional information regarding our segments
    and geographic areas is presented in Note 15 to our
    consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.


Discontinued
    Operations

At the end of 2007, the Company completed the sale of its
    business units that design and manufacture automotive and
    industrial driver controls, motion systems and fluid handling
    systems to Kongsberg Automotive Holding ASA for
    $560 million in cash. On June 29, 2007, we completed
    the sale of a precision-machined components business in our
    Aerospace segment for approximately $134 million in cash.

In 2006, we sold a small medical business. In 2005, we completed
    the sale of our automotive pedal systems business, sold a
    European medical product sterilization business, and completed
    the sale of a surface-engineering/specialty coatings business.

These businesses met the criteria for reporting discontinued
    operations under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 144. “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” In compliance
    with SFAS No. 144, the Company has reported results of
    operations, cash flows and gains (losses) on the disposition of
    these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods
    presented. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial
    statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further information regarding divestiture activity and
    accounting for discontinued operations.

The following business segment and product category information
    reflects businesses in continuing operations as of
    December 31, 2007.

Business Segment
    Overview

Medical

The businesses in our Medical Segment design, manufacture and
    distribute medical devices primarily used in critical care,
    surgical applications and cardiac care. Additionally, the
    company designs, manufactures and supplies devices and
    instruments for medical device manufacturers. We are focused on
    providing disposable or single use medical products for critical
    care and surgery that enhance patient outcomes by providing
    products that are less invasive, reduce infection and improve
    patient safety.

Our products are largely sold and distributed to hospitals and
    healthcare providers and are most widely used in the acute care
    setting for a range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and
    in general and specialty surgical applications. Major
    manufacturing operations are located in Czech Republic, Germany,
    Malaysia, Mexico and the United States. Approximately
    50 percent of our segment revenues are derived from
    customers outside the United States.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, we acquired Arrow International,
    a leading global supplier of catheter-based medical technology
    products used for vascular access and cardiac care. This
    acquisition significantly expanded our disposable medical
    product offerings for critical care, enhanced our global
    footprint and added to our research and development capabilities.

Disposable Medical Products for Critical
    Care:

This is the largest product category in the
    Medical Segment, representing 60 percent of segment
    revenues in 2007. Disposable medical products are used in a wide
    range of critical care procedures for vascular access,
    respiratory care, anesthesia and airway management, treatment of
    urologic conditions, as well as other specialty procedures.
    Disposable medical products for critical care are generally
    marketed under the brand names of Arrow, Rüsch, HudsonRCI,
    Gibeck and Sheridan. The large majority of sales for disposable
    medical products are made to the hospital/healthcare provider
    market, with a smaller percentage sold to alternate sites.

Vascular Access Products:

Our vascular access
    products are generally catheter-based products used in a variety
    of clinical procedures to facilitate multiple critical care
    therapies including the administration of intravenous
    medications and other therapies and the measurement of blood
    pressure and taking of blood samples through a single puncture
    site.


Vascular access catheters and related devices consist
    principally of central venous access catheters such as the
    following: the
    Arrow-Howe’s

tm

Multi-Lumen Catheter, a catheter equipped with three or four
    channels, or lumens; double-and single-lumen catheters, which
    are designed for use in a variety of clinical procedures;
    percutaneous sheath introducers, which are used as a means for
    inserting cardiovascular and other catheterization devices into
    the vascular system during critical care procedures.

We also provide a range of peripherally inserted central
    catheters, which are soft, flexible catheters inserted in the
    upper arm and advanced into the superior vena cava and are
    accessed for various types of intravenous medications and
    therapies, and radial artery catheters, which are used for
    measuring arterial blood pressure and taking blood samples. Our
    offerings include a pressure injectable peripherally inserted
    catheter which addresses the therapeutic need for a catheter
    that can withstand the higher pressures required by the
    injection of contrast media for CT scans.

Our vascular access products also include specialty catheters
    and related products used in a range of procedures and include
    percutaneous thrombolytic devices, which are designed for
    clearance of thrombosed hemodialysis grafts in chronic
    hemodialysis patients; and hemodialysis access catheters,
    including the
    Cannon

®

Catheter, which is used to facilitate dialysis treatment.

Many of our vascular access catheters are treated with the
    ARROWg+ard

®

,or
    ARROWg+ard Blue
    Plus

®

,
    antiseptic surface treatments to reduce the risk of catheter
    related infection. ARROWg+ard Blue Plus, is a newer, longer
    lasting formulation of ARROWg+ard and provides antimicrobial
    treatment of the interior lumens and hubs of each catheter.

As part of our ongoing efforts to meet physicians’ needs
    for safety and management of risk of infection in the hospital
    setting, we sell a Maximal Barrier Protection central venous
    access kit, which includes a full body drape, a catheter treated
    with the ARROWg+ard antimicrobial technology, and other
    accessories. This kit addresses recent guidelines for reducing
    catheter-related bloodstream infections promulgated by the
    Centers for Disease Control and the Institute for Healthcare
    Improvement’s “100,000 Lives” initiative.

Related products include custom tubing sets used to connect
    central venous catheters to blood pressure monitoring devices
    and drug infusion systems, and the Arrow InView portable
    ultrasound machine designed to support placement and
    administration of vascular access products.

Respiratory Care:

Respiratory care products
    principally consist of devices used in oxygen therapy, aerosol
    therapy, and humidification for the mechanically ventilated
    patient. We offer an extensive range of aerosol therapy
    products, from the AquaPak Large Volume Nebulizer, the MicroMist
    and Up-Draft II Small Volume Nebulizer to the Voldyne
    Incentive Spirometer. We are also a global provider of oxygen
    supplies, offering a broad range of products to safely and
    comfortably deliver oxygen therapy. These include nasal
    cannulas, oxygen supply tubing, oxygen masks and bubble
    humidifiers. The full range of these products are used in a
    variety of clinical settings including hospitals, long-term care
    facilities, rehabilitation centers, and patients’ homes to
    treat respiratory ailments such as chronic lung disease,
    pneumonia, cystic fibrosis, and asthma.

Our ventilator accessories humidify and deliver gases from a
    ventilator to the patient. Over time, we have evolved our
    technology to meet changing clinical requirements and
    applications. Our latest innovations in this product category
    include, the Gibeck Humid-Flo and the ConchaTherm, which support
    the complex clinical needs of critical care patients.

The Gibeck Humid-Flo Heat and Moisture Exchanger is designed to
    deliver medicated aerosol treatments to mechanically ventilated
    patients. The HME remains in-line during treatments, allowing
    treatments to be delivered without breaking the ventilator
    circuit and interrupting ventilation, a key strategy in the
    prevention of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), a leading
    hospital-acquired infection. The ConchTherm Neptune is part of a
    complete system designed to heat and humidify respiratory gases
    delivered to patients. The system is used with ventilators,
    continuous flow systems, oxygen diluters and blenders,
    adjustable nebulizer adapters for aerosol therapy or
    nonflammable anesthesia gases to help maintain patient body
    temperature.


Anesthesia and Airway
    Management:

Anesthesiologists depend on our
    highly recognized brands of Hudson, Sheridan and Rusch products
    that include endotracheal tubes, laryngeal masks, airways, and
    face masks to deliver anesthetic agents and oxygen. To assist in
    the placement of endotracheal tubes, we provide a comprehensive
    and unique line of laryngoscope blades and handles, including
    standard halogen and fiber optic light sources. Fiber optic
    light sources offer a high intensity, cool white light without
    generating the same level of heat that comes from standard
    halogen bulbs.

Regional anesthesia products include peripheral nerve blocks.
    Nerve blocks provide pain relief after surgical procedures and
    help clinicians better manage each patient’s pain. We offer
    the first stimulating continuous nerve block catheter, the Arrow
    StimuCath, which confirms the positive placement of the catheter
    next to the nerve. The Flex Tip Plus continuous epidural
    catheter features a soft, flexible tip that helps reduce the
    incidence of complications, such as transient paresthesia and
    inadvertent cannulation of blood vessels or the dura, while
    improving the clinician’s ability to thread the catheter
    into the epidural space. Our Arrow
    TheraCath

®

epidural catheter, with high compression strength for
    direction-ability and enhanced radiopacity, was designed for
    pain management procedures where increased steer-ability is
    important. Additional integral components create a range of
    standard and custom procedural kits.

Urology:

Our urology product line provides
    bladder management for patients in a range of clinical settings.
    These products consist principally of Foley catheters and
    accessories, external catheters, intermittent catheters,
    suprapubic products, endourology products and products for
    urethral access. The largest percentage of urology products are
    sold to hospitals in European and Asian markets with a smaller
    percentage of sales in North America. Our urology products are
    also sold for use in home health and to alternate site providers.

The Rusch MMG Closed System intermittent catheter is clinically
    proven to reduce Urinary Tract Infections, a leading cause of
    death in spinal cord injury patients. Designed using the
    bladder’s natural pressure, the Rusch BellyBag is a urine
    collection bag allowing patients with indwelling catheters
    freedom of movement, and personal discretion.

Surgical Instruments and Medical
    Devices:

Products in this category represented
    25 percent of Medical segment revenues in 2007. Our
    surgical instrument and medical device products include:
    ligation and closure products including appliers, clips, and
    sutures used in a variety of surgical procedures, hand-held
    instruments for general and specialty surgical procedures,
    access ports used in minimally invasive surgical procedures
    including robotic surgery, and fluid management products used
    for chest drainage. In addition, we provide instrument
    management services. We market surgical instruments and medical
    devices under the Deknatel, Pleur-evac, Pilling, Taut and Weck
    brand names.

In 2007, we introduced a number of new products in this
    category, including the Pleur-evac Mini Sahara chest drainage
    product, which is a patented system for thoracic,
    cardiovascular, trauma and critical care. It features
    calibrated, high-suction control with a visual indicator, safe
    tip-over prevention, a patented patient air leak meter, complete
    positive and negative pressure controls, and a proprietary unit
    for pneumonectomy. In 2008, we plan to introduce the Hem-o-lok
    Small clip, a proprietary device with clinical advantages, which
    can seal vessels as small as 1-3 mm, and a new access port for
    minimally invasive surgery.

Devices for Original Equipment
    Manufacturers:

Specialty devices sold to medical
    device manufacturers represented 13 percent of Medical
    segment revenues in 2007. We provide design and prototyping,
    testing, fabrication and manufacturing services to medical
    device manufacturers. Products in this category include
    custom-designed and manufactured specialty instruments for
    cardiovascular and orthopedic procedures, specialty sutures,
    microcatheters, and introducers. Our brand names include TFX
    OEM, Beere, Deknatel, KMedic, and SMD.

Access, procedural and closure devices include custom extrusion
    products of PTFE and other fluropolymers, braid reinforced
    medical tubing, and catheter fabrication. We also supply custom
    suture and medical fibers. Orthopedic surgical instrumentation
    includes precision machined orthopedic and spinal surgical
    instruments.


During 2007, we acquired a provider of fixation devices sold
    under the SMD brand and used primarily for orthopedic
    procedures, expanding our OEM product line.

Cardiac Care Devices:

Cardiac care products
    accounted for approximately 2 percent of revenues in fiscal
    2007. These products include cardiac assist products, such as
    intra-aortic balloon (IAB) pumps and catheters, which are used
    primarily to augment temporarily the pumping capability of the
    heart following cardiac surgery, serious heart attack or balloon
    angioplasty. Our IAB products include the
    AutoCat

tm

2 WAVE IAB pump and associated
    LightWAVE

tm

catheter system, which utilize fiber optic pressure-sensing
    catheter instrumentation and provides total automation of the
    pumping process for the broadest range of patients, including
    those with severely arrhythmic heartbeats.

    improve efficiency of aircraft engine performance and reduce
    turnaround time for maintenance and repairs. Our repair products
    and services business is conducted through a consolidated,
    fifty-one percent owned venture with GE Aircraft Engines, called
    Airfoil Technologies International (ATI). In 2007, ATI signed a
    joint venture and management agreement with Snecma Services to
    expand the range of repair services provided to our customers.

Cargo-handling Systems and Equipment:

Products
    in this category represented 44 percent of Aerospace
    segment revenues in 2007. Our cargo-handling systems include
    on-board cargo-handling systems for wide-body aircraft,
    cargo-loading systems for narrow body aircraft, actuators, cargo
    containers, aftermarket spare parts and repair services.
    Marketed under the Telair International brand name, our
    wide-body cargo-handling systems are sold to aircraft original
    equipment manufacturers or to airlines and air freight carriers
    as “buyer furnished equipment” for original
    installations or as retrofits for existing equipment.
    Cargo-handling systems require a high degree of engineering
    sophistication and are often custom-designed.

In addition to the design and manufacture of cargo systems, we
    provide customers with aftermarket spare parts and repair
    services for their Telair systems. In addition, we design,
    manufacture and repair cargo containers and we also manufacture
    and repair components for our systems and other related aircraft
    controls, including canopy and door actuators, cargo winches and
    flight controls. In November 2007, we acquired Nordisk Aviation
    Products expanding our customer base and global manufacturing
    and service capacity for cargo equipment. Cargo containers are
    marketed under Nordisk Aviation Products and Telair names to
    commercial airlines and to freight companies.

Backlog:

As of December 31, 2007, our
    backlog of firm orders for our Aerospace segment was
    $141 million, of which we expect approximately
    83 percent to be filled in 2008. Our backlog for our
    Aerospace segment on December 31, 2006 was
    $173 million.

Sales and Marketing:

Generally, products sold
    to the aerospace market are sold through our own field
    representatives.

Commercial

Our Commercial segment businesses principally design,
    manufacture and distribute driver controls and engine and drive
    assemblies for the marine market, power and fuel systems for
    truck, rail, automotive and industrial vehicles and rigging
    products and services. Our products are used in a range of
    markets including:


recreational marine, heavy truck, bus, industrial vehicles,
    rail, oil and gas, marine transportation and industrial. Major
    manufacturing operations are located in Canada, Europe,
    Singapore, and the United States.

Marine Driver Controls and Engine Assemblies and Drive
    Parts:

This is the largest single product
    category in the Commercial segment, representing 54 percent
    of Commercial segment revenues in 2007. Products in this
    category include: control cables, mechanical and hydraulic
    steering, throttle controls, instrumentation and engine drive
    parts.

We are a leading global provider of both mechanical and
    hydraulic steering systems for recreational boats. We are also a
    leading distributor of engine assemblies and drive parts. Our

Backlog:

Standard Commercial segment products
    are typically shipped between a few days and three months after
    receipt of order. Therefore, the backlog of such orders is not
    indicative of probable revenues in any future

12-month

period.

Sales and Marketing:

The majority of our
    Commercial segment products are sold through a direct sales
    force of field representatives and technical specialists. Marine
    driver controls and engine and drive parts are sold directly to
    boat builders and engine manufacturers as well as through
    distributors, dealers and retail outlets to reach recreational
    boaters. Auxiliary power units are primarily sold in the North
    American truck market through an agreement with a distributor
    and to the rail market using a direct sales force. Fuel systems
    and components include custom applications sold directly to
    industrial equipment manufacturers and to the automotive
    aftermarket principally in Europe. Rigging products and services
    includes both a retail business and a wholesale business, both
    of which sell through a direct sales force.


Government
    Regulation

Government agencies in a number of countries regulate our
    products and the products sold by our customers utilizing our
    products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and
    government agencies in other countries regulate the approval,
    manufacturing, and sale and marketing of many of our healthcare
    products. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the
    European Aviation Safety Agency regulate the manufacture and
    sale of some of our aerospace products and license the operation
    of our repair stations. For more information, see “Risk
    Factors”.

Competition

Given the range and diversity of our products and markets, no
    one competitor offers competitive products for all the markets
    and customers that we serve. In general, all of our segments and
    product lines face significant competition from competitors of
    varying sizes, although the number of competitors in each market
    tends to be limited. We believe that our competitive position
    depends on the technical competence and creative ability of our
    engineering personnel, the know-how and skill of our
    manufacturing personnel, and the strength and scope of our
    sales, service and distribution networks.

Patents and
    Trademarks

We own a portfolio of patents, patents pending and trademarks.
    We also license various patents and trademarks. Patents for
    individual products extend for varying periods according to the
    date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in
    the various countries where patent protection is obtained.
    Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of
    time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks.
    All capitalized product names throughout this document are
    trademarks owned by, or licensed to, us or our subsidiaries.
    Although these have been of value and are expected to continue
    to be of value in the future, we do not consider any single
    patent or trademark, except for the Teleflex brand and the Arrow
    brand, to be essential to the operation of our business.

Suppliers and
    Materials

Materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased
    from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic
    locations. We are not dependent on any single supplier for a
    substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied
    for our overall operations. Most of the materials and components
    we use are available from multiple sources, and where practical,
    we attempt to identify alternative suppliers. Volatility in
    commodity markets, particularly steel and plastic resins, can
    have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of
    our products. We cannot be assured of successfully passing these
    cost increases through to all of our customers, particularly
    original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

Seasonality

Portions of our revenues, particularly in the Commercial and
    Medical segments, are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Revenues
    in the marine aftermarket generally increase in the second
    quarter as boat owners prepare their watercraft for the upcoming
    season. Incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as
    the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues
    related to disposable medical products.

Employees

We employed approximately 14,000 full-time and temporary
    employees at December 31, 2007. Of these employees,
    approximately 4,400 were employed in the United States and 9,600
    in countries outside of the United States. Less than
    8 percent of our employees in the United States were
    covered by union contracts. We have government-mandated
    collective-bargaining arrangements or union contracts that cover
    employees in other countries. We believe we have good
    relationships with our employees.


Investor
    Information

We are subject to the informational requirements of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Therefore, we file reports,
    proxy statements and other information with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission (SEC). Such reports, proxy and information
    statements, and other information may be obtained by visiting

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

We are subject to certain risks that could adversely affect our
    business, financial condition and results of operations. These
    risks include, but are not limited to the following:

We may not be able to successfully complete the integration
    of Arrow or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Arrow
    acquisition.

The integration of Arrow into our Medical Segment involves a
    number of risks and presents financial, managerial and
    operational challenges. In particular, we may have difficulty,
    and may incur unanticipated expenses related to:

•

consolidating manufacturing and administrative functions;

•

complying with legal requirements applicable to certain aspects
    of the integration;

•

retaining key employees;

•

consolidating infrastructures and systems;

•

coordinating sales and marketing functions;

•

preserving our and Arrow’s customer, supplier and other
    important relationships; and

•

minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from
    ongoing business concerns.

The success of the Arrow acquisition will depend, in part, on
    our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings
    from successfully combining the businesses of Arrow and of
    Teleflex Medical in the time frame we anticipate. If we are not
    able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits,
    synergies and cost savings of the business combination may not
    be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than
    expected.

Failure to successfully complete the integration of Arrow or
    achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Arrow may
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Our inability to resolve issues related to the FDA corporate
    warning letter issued to Arrow could have an adverse impact on
    our business, financial condition and results of operations.


On October 11, 2007, Arrow received a corporate warning
    letter from the FDA, which expresses concerns with Arrow’s
    quality systems, including complaint handling, corrective and
    preventive action, process and design validation and inspection
    and training procedures. While we are working with the FDA to
    resolve these issues, this work has required and will continue
    to require the dedication of significant internal and external
    resources. There can be no assurances regarding the length of
    time or cost it will take us to resolve these issues to the
    satisfaction of the FDA. In addition, if our remedial actions
    are not satisfactory to the FDA, we may have to devote
    additional financial and human resources to our efforts, and the
    FDA may take further regulatory actions against us. These
    actions may include seizing our product inventory, obtaining a
    court injunction against further marketing of our products,
    assessing civil monetary penalties or imposing a consent decree
    on us, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

We have substantial debt obligations that could adversely
    impact our business, results of operations and financial
    condition.

We incurred significant indebtedness to fund a portion of the
    consideration for our acquisition of Arrow. As of
    December 31, 2007, our outstanding indebtedness was
    approximately $1.7 billion. We will be required to use a
    significant portion of our operating cash flow to reduce our
    indebtedness over the next few years, resulting in a reduction
    of the cash flow available to fund working capital, capital
    expenditures, acquisitions and investments. Our indebtedness may
    also subject us to greater vulnerability to general adverse
    economic and industry conditions and increase our vulnerability
    to increases in interest rates because a portion of our
    indebtedness bears interest at floating rates.

Our senior credit facility and agreements with the holders of
    our senior notes, which we refer to as our senior debt
    facilities, impose certain operating and financial covenants
    that limit our ability to, among other things:

•

incur debt;

•

create liens;

•

consolidate, merge or dispose of assets;

•

make investments;

•

engage in acquisitions

•

pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of
    our capital stock; and

•

enter into derivative agreements to manage exposure to changes
    in interest rates.

In addition, the terms of our senior credit facilities require
    us to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our
    ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events
    beyond our control, and in the event of a significant
    deterioration of our economic performance, we cannot assure you
    that we will be able to satisfy those ratios. A breach of any of
    these covenants could result in a default under our senior
    credit facilities. If we fail to maintain compliance with these
    covenants and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders under the
    senior credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all
    amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities
    to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments
    to extend further credit under such facilities. If the lenders
    under the senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of
    borrowings and we are not able to obtain financing to satisfy
    this obligation, we likely would have to liquidate significant
    assets which nevertheless may not be sufficient to repay our
    borrowings.

We are subject to risks associated with our

non-U.S. operations.

Although no material concentration of our manufacturing
    operations exists in any single country, we have significant
    manufacturing operations outside the United States, including
    operations conducted through entities that are not wholly-owned
    and other alliances. As of, and for the year ended,
    December 31, 2007, approximately 49% of our total fixed
    assets and 56% of our total revenues were attributable to
    products directly


distributed from our operations outside the U.S. Our
    international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk
    inherent in doing business outside the U.S., including:

•

exchange controls and currency restrictions;

•

trade protection measures;

•

import or export requirements;

•

subsidies or increased access to capital for firms who are
    currently or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we
    have operations;

•

potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;

•

differing labor regulations;

•

differing protection of intellectual property;

•

unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks
    against American interests; and

•

regional and national tenders (which may be exclusive).

These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on
    our international operations or on our business, results of
    operations and financial condition generally.

Customers in our Medical Segment depend on third party
    reimbursement and the failure of healthcare programs to provide
    reimbursement or the reduction in levels of reimbursement for
    our medical products could adversely affect our Medical
    Segment.

Demand for some of our medical products is impacted by the
    reimbursement to our customers of patients’ medical
    expenses by government healthcare programs and private health
    insurers in the countries where we do business. Internationally,
    medical reimbursement systems vary significantly, with medical
    centers in some countries having fixed budgets, regardless of
    the level of patient treatment. Other countries require
    application for, and approval of, government or third party
    reimbursement. Without both favorable coverage determinations
    by, and the financial support of, government and third party
    insurers, the market for some of our medical products could be
    adversely impacted.

We cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the
    current level of reimbursement to our customers for use of our
    existing products. Adverse coverage determinations or any
    reduction in the amount of this reimbursement could harm our
    business. In addition, as a result of their purchasing power,
    these payors often seek discounts, price reductions or other
    incentives from medical products suppliers. Our provision of
    such pricing concessions could negatively impact our revenues
    and product margins.

Uncertainties regarding future healthcare policy, legislation
    and regulations, as well as private market practices, could
    affect our ability to sell our products in acceptable quantities
    at profitable prices.

Foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest
    rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the
    effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity
    prices and interest rates. We expect revenue from products
    manufactured in, and sold into,

non-U.S. markets

to continue to represent a significant portion of our net
    revenue. Our consolidated financial statements reflect
    translation of financial statements denominated in

non-U.S. currencies

to U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. When the
    U.S. dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the
    foreign currencies of the countries where we sell or manufacture
    our products, such as the euro, our U.S. dollar-reported
    revenue and income will fluctuate. Although we have entered into
    forward contracts with several major financial institutions to
    hedge a portion of projected cash flows in order to reduce the
    effects of this fluctuation, changes in the relative values of
    currencies may, in some instances, have a significant effect on
    our results of operations.


Many of our products have significant steel and plastic resin
    content. We also use quantities of other commodities, including
    copper and zinc. Although we monitor our exposure to these
    commodity price increases as an integral part of our overall
    risk management program, volatility in the prices of these
    commodities could increase the costs of our products and
    services. We may not be able to pass on these costs to our
    customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations and cash flows.

Our failure to successfully develop new products could
    adversely affect our results.

The future success of our business will depend, in part, on our
    ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and
    to enhance existing products, particularly in the medical device
    industry, which is characterized by rapid product development
    and technological advances. This product development may require
    substantial investment by us. There can be no assurance that
    unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the
    development, performance or market acceptance of new
    technologies or products, such as the inability to:

•

identify viable new products;

•

obtain adequate intellectual property protection;

•

gain market acceptance of new products; or

•

successfully obtain regulatory approvals.

Moreover, we may not otherwise be able to successfully develop
    and market new products. Our failure to successfully develop and
    market new products could reduce our margins, which would have
    an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Our technology is important to our success, and our failure
    to protect this technology could put us at a competitive
    disadvantage.

Because many of our products rely on proprietary technology, we
    believe that the development and protection of these
    intellectual property rights is important, though not essential,
    to the future success of our business. In addition to relying on
    our patents, trademarks and copyrights, we rely on
    confidentiality agreements with employees and other measures to
    protect our know-how and trade secrets. Despite our efforts to
    protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors
    may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or
    technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized
    use of this technology, particularly in foreign countries where
    the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in
    the U.S. Moreover, there can be no assurance that others
    will not independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or
    develop better technology than ours or that current and former
    employees, contractors and other parties will not breach
    confidentiality agreements, misappropriate proprietary
    information and copy or otherwise obtain and use our information
    and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise
    infringe on our intellectual property rights. Our inability to
    protect our proprietary technology could result in competitive
    harm that could adversely affect our business.

We depend upon relationships with physicians and other health
    care professionals.

The research and development of some of our products is
    dependent on our maintaining strong working relationships with
    physicians and other health care professionals. We rely on these
    professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and
    experience regarding our products and the development of our
    products. Physicians assist us as researchers, product
    consultants, inventors and as public speakers. If we fail to
    maintain our working relationships with physicians and receive
    the benefits of their knowledge, advice and input, our products
    may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and
    expectations of the professionals who use and support our
    products, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.


In the course of our business, we are subject to a variety of
    litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations and financial condition.

We are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the
    normal course of business. These lawsuits and claims include
    actions involving product liability, contracts, intellectual
    property, employment and environmental matters. The defense of
    these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, and
    we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits.
    In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or
    settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable
    remedies, that could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations.

While we do not believe that any litigation in which we are
    currently engaged would have such an adverse effect, the outcome
    of these legal proceedings may differ from our expectations
    because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory
    matters, are often difficult to reliably predict and we cannot
    assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations

We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product
    liability, warranty and recall claims that may be brought
    against us.

Although the Company carries product liability insurance we may
    be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event
    that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as
    expected or the use of our products results, or is alleged to
    result, in bodily injury

and/or

property damage. Accordingly, we could experience material
    warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur
    significant costs to defend these claims. In addition, if any of
    our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be
    required to participate in a recall of that product if the
    defect or the alleged defect relates to safety. Product
    liability, warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Much of our business is subject to extensive government
    regulation, and our failure to comply with those regulations
    could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations and financial condition and we may incur significant
    expenses to comply with these regulations.

Numerous national and local government agencies in a number of
    countries regulate our products. The U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration (“FDA”) and government agencies in
    other countries regulate the approval, manufacturing and sale
    and marketing of many of our medical products. The
    U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the European
    Aviation Safety Agency regulate the manufacture and sale of some
    of our aerospace products and licenses the operation of our
    repair stations.

Failure to comply with applicable regulations and quality
    assurance guidelines could lead to manufacturing shutdowns,
    product shortages, delays in product manufacturing, product
    seizures, recalls, operating restrictions, withdrawal of
    required licenses, prohibitions against exporting of products to
    countries outside the United States, importing products from
    manufacturing facilities outside the U.S., and civil and
    criminal penalties, including exclusion under Medicaid or
    Medicare, any one or more of which could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a
    medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign
    governmental authorities, can be costly and time consuming, and
    approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely
    basis, if at all, resulting in delayed realization of product
    revenues or in substantial additional costs, which could have
    material adverse effects on our financial condition and results
    of operations. Our Medical Segment facilities are subject to
    periodic inspection by the FDA and numerous other federal, state
    and foreign governmental authorities, which require
    manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain
    regulations, including testing, quality control and
    documentation procedures.

We are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining
    to healthcare pricing and fraud and abuse, including
    anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of these laws
    may be punishable by criminal or civil


sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and
    exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare
    programs.

In addition, we are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state
    and local environmental protection and health and safety laws
    governing, among other things:

•

the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous
    materials;

•

emissions or discharges of substances into the
    environment; and

•

the health and safety of our employees.

These laws and government regulations are complex, change
    frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time.
    We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with
    current or future environmental protection and health and safety
    laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases
    of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our
    estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition
    and results of operations. Moreover, we may be subject to
    additional environmental claims, which may include claims for
    personal injury or cleanup, in the future based on our past,
    present or future business activities, which could also
    adversely affect our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Our acquisitions and strategic alliances may not meet revenue
    or profit expectations.

As part of our strategy for growth, we have made and may
    continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into
    strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development
    agreements. However, we may not be able to identify suitable
    acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate
    acquisitions successfully, and our strategic alliances may not
    prove to be successful. In this regard, acquisitions involve
    numerous risks, including difficulties in the integration of the
    operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired
    companies and the diversion of management’s attention from
    other business concerns. Although our management will endeavor
    to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction,
    there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain all
    such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and
    future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of
    substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. Future
    acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances
    of equity securities. There can be no assurance that
    difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar
    agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of
    services.

Approximately 6% of our manufacturing revenues are produced by
    operations for which a significant part of our workforce is
    covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar
    agreements in foreign jurisdictions. It is likely that a portion
    of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining
    and similar agreements for the foreseeable future. Strikes or
    work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our
    relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our
    business.

In addition to the properties listed above, we own or lease
    approximately 1.0 million square feet of warehousing,
    manufacturing and office space located in the United States,
    Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe, Australia, Asia and
    Africa. We also own or lease certain properties that are no
    longer being used in our operations. We are actively marketing
    these properties for sale or sublease. At December 31,
    2007, the unused owned properties were classified as held for
    sale.


ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

On October 11, 2007, the Company’s subsidiary, Arrow
    International, Inc. (“Arrow”), received a corporate
    warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
    (FDA). The letter cites three site-specific warning letters
    issued by the FDA in 2005 and subsequent inspections performed
    from June 2005 to February 2007 at Arrow’s facilities in
    the United States. The letter expresses concerns with
    Arrow’s quality systems, including complaint handling,
    corrective and preventive action, process and design validation,
    inspection and training procedures. It also advises that
    Arrow’s corporate-wide program to evaluate, correct and
    prevent quality system issues has been deficient. Limitations on
    pre-market approvals and certificates of foreign goods had
    previously been imposed on Arrow based on prior inspections, and
    the corporate warning letter does not impose additional
    sanctions that are expected to have a material financial impact
    on the Company.

In connection with its acquisition of Arrow, completed on
    October 1, 2007, the Company has developed an integration
    plan that includes the commitment of significant resources to
    correct these previously-identified regulatory issues and
    further improve overall quality systems. Senior management
    officials from the Company have met with FDA representatives,
    and a comprehensive written corrective action plan was presented
    to FDA in late 2007. The Company has begun implementing its
    corrective action plan, which it expects to complete by the end
    of 2008.

While we believe we can remediate these issues in an expeditious
    manner, there can be no assurances regarding the length of time
    or expenditures required to resolve these issues to the
    satisfaction of the FDA. If our remedial actions are not
    satisfactory to the FDA, we may have to devote additional
    financial and human resources to our efforts, and the FDA may
    take further regulatory actions against us, including, but not
    limited to, seizing our product inventory, obtaining a court
    injunction against further marketing of our products or
    assessing civil monetary penalties.

In addition, we are a party to various lawsuits and claims
    arising in the normal course of business. These lawsuits and
    claims include actions involving product liability, intellectual
    property, employment and environmental matters. Based on
    information currently available, advice of counsel, established
    reserves and other resources, we do not believe that any such
    actions are likely to be, individually or in the aggregate,
    material to our business, financial condition, results of
    operations or liquidity. However, in the event of unexpected
    further developments, it is possible that the ultimate
    resolution of these matters, or other similar matters, if
    unfavorable, may be materially adverse to our business,
    financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Various senior and term note agreements provide for the
    maintenance of certain financial ratios and limit the repurchase
    of our stock and payment of cash dividends. Under the most
    restrictive of these provisions, on an annual basis
    $75 million of retained earnings was available for
    dividends and stock repurchases at December 31, 2007. On
    February 26, 2008, the Board of Directors declared a
    quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share on our common stock, which
    is payable on March 17, 2008 to holders of record on
    March 5, 2008. As of February 26, 2008, we had
    approximately 952 holders of record of our common stock.

On June 14, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of
    outstanding Company common stock. Repurchases of Company stock
    under the program may be made from time to time in the open
    market and may include privately-negotiated transactions as
    market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory
    considerations. The stock repurchase program has no expiration
    date and the Company’s ability to execute on the program
    will depend on, among other factors, cash requirements for
    acquisitions, cash generation from operations, debt repayment
    obligations, market conditions and regulatory requirements. In
    addition, under the senior loan agreements entered into
    October 1, 2007, the Company is subject to certain
    restrictions relating to its ability to repurchase shares in the
    event the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio exceeds
    certain levels, which further limit the Company’s ability
    to repurchase shares under this program. Through
    December 31, 2007, no shares have been purchased under this
    plan.

On July 25, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $140 million of outstanding Teleflex
    common stock over twelve months ended July 2006. In June 2006,
    our Board of Directors extended for an additional six months,
    until January 2007, its authorization for the repurchase of
    shares. Under the Board’s authorization, we repurchased a
    total of 2,317,347 shares on the open market during 2005
    and 2006 for an aggregate purchase price of $140.0 million,
    and aggregate fees and commissions of $0.1 million.


The following graph provides a comparison of five year
    cumulative total stockholder returns of Teleflex common stock,
    the Standard & Poor (S&P) 500 Stock Index and the
    S&P MidCap 400 Index. We have selected the S&P MidCap
    400 Index because, due to the diverse nature of our businesses,
    we do not believe that there exists a relevant published
    industry or line-of-business index and do not believe we can
    reasonably identify a peer group. The annual changes for the
    five-year period shown on the graph are based on the assumption
    that $100 had been invested in Teleflex common stock and each
    index on December 31, 2002 and that all dividends were
    reinvested.

Free cash flow is calculated by reducing cash provided by
    operating activities from continuing operations by capital
    expenditures and dividends. Free cash flow is considered a
    non-GAAP financial measure. We use this financial measure for
    internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance
    on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate

period-to-period

comparisons. This financial measure is used in addition to and
    in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP
    and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial
    measures. This financial measure reflects an additional way of
    viewing an aspect of our operations that, when viewed with our
    GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation to the
    corresponding GAAP financial measure, provides a more complete
    understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.
    Management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to
    investors because it provides an indication of the amount of our
    cash flow currently available to support our ongoing operations.
    Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial
    statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to
    not rely on any single financial measure. The following is a
    reconciliation of free cash flow to the nearest GAAP measure as
    required under Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Overview

We have been focused on creating a portfolio of businesses that
    provides greater consistency of performance, improved
    profitability and sustainable growth. To accomplish this, in
    2007 we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio
    through acquisitions and divestitures to improve margins, reduce
    cyclicality and focus our resources on the development of our
    core businesses.


We are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth
    through our internal growth initiatives which include the
    development of new products, expansion of market share, moving
    existing products into new geographies, and through selected
    acquisitions which enhance or expedite our development
    initiatives and our ability to grow market share.

The Teleflex portfolio of businesses changed significantly in
    2007 with acquisitions in all three business segments and
    significant divestitures in both Commercial and Aerospace.
    During 2007, in our Medical Segment, we completed the
    acquisition of Arrow International, a medical products company
    with annual revenues of over $500 million, which
    significantly expanded the Segment. We also completed the
    acquisition of a small orthopedic device manufacturer to expand
    our capability to serve medical device manufacturers. In our
    Commercial Segment, we acquired a rigging services business with
    annual revenues of approximately $25 million. At the end of
    the fiscal year, we completed the divestiture of our automotive
    and industrial businesses with 2007 revenues of over
    $860 million, significantly reducing the size of our
    Commercial Segment. In our Aerospace Segment, we acquired a
    cargo equipment business with annual revenues of approximately
    $55 million and divested a precision — machined
    components business with approximately $130 million in
    revenues.

The following bullet points summarize our more significant
    acquisitions and divestitures in 2007 and 2006, and the results
    for the acquired businesses are included in the respective
    Segments. See Notes 3 and 16 to our consolidated financial
    statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information regarding our significant
    acquisitions and divestitures.

We incurred significant indebtedness to fund a portion of the
    consideration for our October 2007 acquisition of Arrow. As of
    December 31, 2007, our outstanding indebtedness was
    $1.7 billion, up from


$0.5 billion as of
    December 31, 2006. For additional information regarding our
    indebtedness, please see “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources” below and Note 8 to our consolidated
    financial statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Results of
    Operations

Discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a
    purchased company for up to twelve months beyond the date of
    acquisition. Activity beyond the initial twelve months is
    considered core growth. Core growth excludes the impact of
    translating the results of international subsidiaries at
    different currency exchange rates from year to year and the
    comparable activity of divested companies within the most recent
    twelve-month period.

The following comparisons exclude the impact of the Teleflex
    Aerospace Manufacturing Group (“TAMG”), the automotive
    and industrial driver control, motion systems and fluid handling
    systems business, the automotive pedal systems business, the
    Sermatech International business, a European medical product
    sterilization business and a small medical business, which have
    been presented in our consolidated financial results as
    discontinued operations (see Note 16 for discussion of
    discontinued operations).

Comparison of
    2007 and 2006

Net revenues increased 14% in 2007 to $1.93 billion from
    $1.69 billion in 2006, entirely due to acquisitions and
    foreign currency movements. The Medical, Aerospace and
    Commercial segments comprised 54%, 23% and 23% of our 2007
    revenues, respectively.

There was no core revenue growth in 2007 overall as compared to
    2006. Core growth in our Aerospace Segment was 7%, and our
    Medical and Commercial Segments declined 1% and 5%, respectively
    year over year.

Materials, labor and other product costs as a percentage of
    revenues improved to 64.8% in 2007 from 65.4% in 2006, due
    primarily to cost and productivity improvements in our Medical
    segment and the benefits of our restructuring initiatives and
    other cost reduction efforts which offset the negative impact
    from a $29 million charge related to a fair value
    adjustment to inventory acquired in the Arrow acquisition, which
    was sold during 2007. Selling, engineering and administrative
    expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 23.0% in 2007
    compared with 22.2% in 2006, due primarily to approximately
    $7 million higher amortization expense from the Arrow
    acquisition. The $30.0 million write-off of in-process
    research and development costs is related to in-process R&D
    projects acquired in the Arrow acquisition which the Company
    believes have no alternative future use in their current state.
    During its annual test for goodwill impairment the Company
    determined $16.4 million of its goodwill attributable to
    its businesses that manufacture and sell auxiliary power units
    in the North American heavy truck and rail markets, as well as
    components and systems for use of alternative fuels in
    industrial vehicles and passenger cars, was impaired. Recent
    softness in certain of these markets negatively impacted the
    valuation of goodwill resulting in the impairment charge. The
    remaining $2.5 million goodwill impairment is related to a
    write-down to the agreed selling price of one of the
    Company’s variable interest entities in its Commercial
    segment.

Interest expense increased from $41.2 million to
    $74.9 million in 2007 principally as a result of higher
    debt levels since October 1, 2007 incurred in connection
    with the Arrow acquisition. Interest income increased in 2007
    primarily due to higher average cash balances during the first
    three quarters of 2007. Taxes on income from continuing
    operations of $122.8 million in 2007 include discrete
    income tax charges incurred in connection with the Arrow
    acquisition. Specifically, in connection with funding the
    acquisition of Arrow, the Company (i) repatriated
    approximately $197.0 million of cash from foreign
    subsidiaries which had previously been deemed to be permanently
    reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions; and
    (ii) changed its position with respect to certain
    additional previously untaxed foreign earnings to treat these
    earnings as no longer permanently reinvested. These items
    resulted in a discrete income tax charge in 2007 of
    approximately


$91.8 million. The effective
    income tax rate was 112.3% in 2007 compared with 21.6% in 2006.
    The increase in the effective income tax rate primarily reflects
    the impact of the repatriation of cash from foreign subsidiaries
    and the change in position regarding untaxed foreign earnings.
    Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased
    $5.7 million in 2007 due to increased profits from our
    entities that are not wholly-owned. Gain on disposal of
    discontinued operations was $299.5 million in 2007 as
    compared to $0.2 million in 2006. The significant increase
    was driven by the sale of TAMG and the automotive and industrial
    businesses. Net income for 2007 was $146.5 million compared
    to $139.4 million for 2006. Diluted earnings per share
    increased 7% to $3.73 for 2007.

In connection with the October 2007 acquisition of Arrow, the
    Company formulated a plan related to the future integration of
    Arrow with the Company’s Medical businesses. The plan
    focuses on the closure of Arrow corporate functions and the
    consolidation of manufacturing, sales, marketing, and
    distribution functions in North America, Europe and Asia. Costs
    estimated to be incurred affecting Arrow employees and
    facilities, totaling $31.6 million, have been included in
    the allocation of the purchase price of Arrow, while costs
    related to actions that affect Teleflex employees and facilities
    will be included in restructuring and impairment charges when
    incurred. Approximately $0.9 million has been charged to
    restructuring and impairment during the fourth quarter of 2007
    with an additional $25-30 million expected in 2008 and
    2009, a majority of which is expected to be cash outlays. The
    Company expects to realize annual savings of between
    $70-75 million in 2010 when these integration and
    restructuring actions are complete.

In June 2006, we began certain restructuring initiatives that
    affected all three of our operating segments. These initiatives
    involve the consolidation of operations and a related reduction
    in workforce at several of our facilities in Europe and North
    America. We took these initiatives as a means to improving
    operating performance and to better leverage our existing
    resources. The charges associated with the 2006 restructuring
    program that are included in restructuring and impairment
    charges during 2007 and 2006 totaled $3.4 million and
    $3.0 million, respectively. The segment component of the
    2007 charges are 53%, 39% and 8% attributable to our Medical,
    Aerospace and Commercial Segments, respectively. The segment
    component of the 2006 charges are 51%, 37% and 12% attributable
    to our Medical, Aerospace and Commercial Segments, respectively.
    As of December 31, 2007, we expect to incur future
    restructuring costs associated with our 2006 restructuring
    program of between $1.0 million and $2.0 million in
    our Medical Segment over the next two quarters. Also during
    2007, we determined that three minority held investments and
    certain fixed assets were impaired and recorded an aggregate
    charge of $3.9 million, which is included in restructuring
    and impairment charges.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we announced and commenced
    implementation of a restructuring and divestiture program
    designed to improve future operating performance and position us
    for future earnings growth. The actions have included exiting or
    divesting non-core or low performing businesses, consolidating
    manufacturing operations and reorganizing administrative
    functions to enable businesses to share services. The charges,
    including changes in estimates, associated with the 2004
    restructuring and divestiture program for continuing operations
    that are included in restructuring and impairment charges during
    2007, 2006, and 2005 totaled $0.7 million,
    $10.4 million and $23.4 million, respectively. The
    $0.7 million and $10.4 million was attributable to our
    Medical Segment. Of the $23.4 million, 87% and 13% were
    attributable to our Medical and Aerospace Segments,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2007, we do not expect to
    incur future restructuring costs associated with our 2004
    restructuring and divestiture program.

Certain 2005 costs associated with the 2004 restructuring and
    divestiture program are not included in restructuring and
    impairment charges. All inventory adjustments that resulted from
    the 2004 restructuring and divestiture program and certain other
    costs associated with closing out businesses during 2005 are
    included in materials, labor and other product costs in the
    Aerospace segment and totaled $2.0 million.

For a more complete discussion of our restructuring programs,
    see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.


Comparison of
    2006 and 2005

Revenues increased 8% in 2006 to $1.69 billion from
    $1.56 billion in 2005, principally due to core growth. The
    Medical, Aerospace and Commercial segments comprised 51%, 24%
    and 25% of our 2006 revenues, respectively.

Materials, labor and other product costs as a percentage of
    revenues improved to 65.4% in 2006 from 66.9% in 2005, due
    primarily to the benefits of our restructuring initiatives and
    other cost reduction efforts. Selling, engineering and
    administrative expenses (operating expenses) as a percentage of
    revenues increased to 22.2% in 2006 compared with 21.4% in 2005,
    due primarily to $10.4 million of costs associated with the
    initial phases of an information systems implementation program
    in our Medical Segment, $6.8 million of stock-based
    compensation expensed under SFAS No. 123(R) and
    various temporary inefficiencies in our Medical Segment during
    the first half of 2006.

On December 26, 2005, we adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,”
    which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation
    expense for all stock-based awards made to employees based on
    estimated fair values. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes
    previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board, or APB,
    Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees,” for periods beginning in fiscal 2006. In March
    2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB,
    No. 107, providing supplemental implementation guidance for
    SFAS 123(R). We have applied the provisions of
    SAB No. 107 in our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R).

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we accounted
    for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value
    method in accordance with APB No. 25, as allowed under
    SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation.” Under the intrinsic value method, no
    stock-based compensation expense for employee stock options had
    been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations
    because the exercise price of our stock options granted to
    employees equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock
    at the date of grant. In accordance with the modified
    prospective transition method we used in adopting
    SFAS No. 123(R), our results of operations prior to
    fiscal 2006 have not been restated to reflect, and do not
    include, the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). As of
    December 31, 2006, total unamortized stock-based
    compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, net of
    expected forfeitures, was $9.2 million, which is expected
    to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    1.9 years. Additional information regarding stock-based
    compensation and our stock compensation plans is presented in
    Notes 1 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Interest expense declined in 2006 principally as a result of
    lower debt balances. Interest income increased in 2006 primarily
    due to higher average cash balances and more favorable interest
    rates compared to the prior period. The effective income tax
    rate was 21.6% in 2006 compared with 20.6% 2005. The increase in
    the effective income tax rate primarily reflects the favorable
    impact in 2005 of the American Jobs Creation Act, or AJCA,
    repatriation benefit. Minority interest in consolidated
    subsidiaries increased $4.2 million in 2006 due to
    increased profits from our entities that are not wholly-owned.
    Net income for 2006 was $139.4 million compared to
    $138.8 million for 2005. Diluted earnings per share
    increased 3% to $3.49 for 2006.

We performed an annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill
    and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of
    2006 and determined that a portion of our goodwill was impaired
    for which we recorded a charge of $1.0 million. Also during
    2006, we determined that three minority held investments and
    certain fixed assets were impaired and recorded an aggregate
    charge of $7.4 million, which is included in restructuring
    and impairment charges.

The following is a discussion of our segment operating results.
    Additional information regarding our segments is presented in
    Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included
    in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Medical

Comparison of
    2007 and 2006

Medical Segment revenues increased 21% in 2007 to
    $1,041.3 million from $858.7 million in 2006, entirely
    due to acquisitions and currency movements. Revenues related to
    the acquisition of Arrow International contributed
    $133.8 million, or 16% of this increase. Increased sales of
    disposable medical products for airway management, respiratory
    care, urology, and surgical devices to European hospital markets
    and to Asian hospital markets, was more than offset by a decline
    in sales of orthopedic specialty devices sold to medical device
    manufacturers, the phase out of some product lines for medical
    device manufacturers and a decline in sales of products for
    alternate sites in North America.

Medical Segment operating profit increased 13% in 2007 to
    $182.6 million from $161.7 million in 2006 primarily
    due to the increase in volume from the Arrow acquisition, the
    positive impact from the full year effect of cost and
    productivity improvements that began in the second half of 2006,
    following completion of significant restructuring activities,
    and currency movements, which more than offset the negative
    impact from a $29 million charge in 2007 related to the
    fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the Arrow
    acquisition, which was sold in 2007. During the first half of
    2006, operating profit was negatively impacted by costs


associated with operational
    inefficiencies and the consolidation of facilities and
    distribution centers. Operating profit as a percent of revenues
    decreased to 17.5% in 2007 from 18.8% in 2006.

Assets in the Medical Segment increased $2,419 million or
    262%, primarily due to acquisition of Arrow in October 2007.

Comparison of
    2006 and 2005

Medical Segment revenues increased 3% in 2006 to
    $858.7 million from $831.1 million in 2005,
    principally due to core growth. The segment benefited from sales
    of new products in respiratory care and sleep therapy, including
    distribution of products through alliances with other
    manufacturers, and continued growth of diagnostic and
    therapeutic device products sold to medical device
    manufacturers, offset by a decline in sales of orthopedic
    specialty devices sold to medical device manufacturers.

Medical Segment operating profit increased 8% in 2006 to
    $161.7 million from $150.0 million in 2005. This
    increase primarily reflects cost and productivity improvements
    in the second half of the year, following completion of
    significant restructuring activities. During the first half of
    2006, operating profit was negatively impacted by costs
    associated with operational inefficiencies and the consolidation
    of facilities and distribution centers. We also incurred
    significant costs as planned in connection with the initial
    phases of an information systems implementation program during
    the first half of 2006. Operating profit as a percent of
    revenues increased to 18.8% in 2006 from 18.0% in 2005.

Assets in the Medical Segment declined $4.2 million or 1%,
    primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable, deferred
    tax assets and net property, plant and equipment, offset, in
    part, by the impact of the Taut acquisition and the impact of
    currency.

Aerospace

Comparison of
    2007 and 2006

Aerospace Segment revenues increased 11% in 2007 to
    $451.8 million from $405.4 million in 2006. This
    increase was due to increases of 7% from core growth, 3% from
    acquisitions and 1% from foreign currency movements. Core growth
    was primarily attributable to increased sales of on board wide
    body cargo handling systems and narrow body cargo loading
    systems, combined with steady increases in sales volume for
    aftermarket spares and repairs throughout the year.

Aerospace Segment operating profit increased 17% to
    $47.0 million from $40.2 million in 2006 as a result
    of higher volume, productivity improvements, and cost control
    efforts in both the cargo handling systems and engine repair
    businesses, as well as the positive impact of restructuring in
    engine repair services. Operating profit as a percent of
    revenues increased to 10.4% in 2007 from 9.9% in 2006.

Assets in the Aerospace Segment decreased $12.1 million or
    5%, primarily due to the sale of the Teleflex Aerospace
    Manufacturing Group during the second quarter of 2007, offset by
    the acquisition of Nordisk during the fourth quarter of 2007.

Comparison of
    2006 and 2005

Aerospace Segment revenues increased 11% in 2006 to
    $405.4 million from $366.8 million in 2005. This
    increase was due to increases of 10% from core growth and 1%
    from acquisitions. Core growth in wide body cargo handling
    systems and repair services was partially offset by the
    $6.5 million decrease in revenues resulting from the phase
    out of our industrial gas turbine aftermarket services business
    in 2005.

Aerospace Segment operating profit increased 51% to
    $40.2 million from $26.6 million in 2005.
    Volume-related efficiencies and additional higher margin cargo
    spares sales contributed to the improvement, as did a reduction
    in losses resulting from the exit of the industrial gas turbine
    aftermarket services business. Operating profit as a percent of
    revenues increased to 9.9% in 2006 from 7.3% in 2005.


Assets in the Aerospace Segment increased $4.3 million or
    2%, primarily due to the impact of currency.

Commercial

Comparison of
    2007 and 2006

Commercial Segment revenues increased 3% in 2007 to
    $441.2 million from $426.8 million in 2006. The
    favorable impact of acquisitions and foreign currency movements
    and an increase in sales of products for marine markets offset a
    decline in core revenue growth attributable to a significant
    decline in sales of auxiliary power units in the North American
    heavy truck market and to lower sales of rigging services where
    unusually high demand as a result of U.S. Gulf Coast
    rebuilding activities due to severe weather during 2006 caused
    unfavorable comparisons in 2007.

Commercial Segment operating profit declined 25% in 2007 to
    $23.0 million from $30.5 million in 2006. Operating
    profit was negatively impacted by commodity price increases,
    lower volumes of auxiliary power units and from approximately
    $4 million in provisions for warranty and other costs
    related to prior generation auxiliary power units sold to the
    North American truck market, which more than offset the positive
    impact of cost and productivity improvements in the business
    serving the marine market. Operating profit as a percent of
    revenues declined to 5.2% in 2007 from 7.1% in 2006.

Assets in the Commercial Segment declined $492 million or 69%,
    primarily due to the sale of its business units that design and
    manufacture automotive and industrial driver controls, motion
    systems and fluid handling systems, and to the
    $22.6 million impairment of goodwill and other long-lived
    assets.

Comparison of
    2006 and 2005

Commercial Segment revenues increased 17% in 2006 to
    $426.8 million from $363.9 million in 2005,
    principally due to core growth. The segment benefited from
    increased sales in 2006 of alternative fuel systems and
    auxiliary power units and sales of heavy-duty rigging and cable
    used in marine construction and the securing of oil platforms
    resulting from rebuilding efforts in the Gulf of Mexico.

Commercial Segment operating profit increased 29% in 2006 to
    $30.5 million from $23.6 million in 2005. Operating
    profit improvements were largely due to higher sales volumes of
    alternative fuel systems, auxiliary power units, and heavy duty
    rigging and cable which more than offset the negative impact of
    increases in commodity pricing impacting our Marine products.
    Operating profit as a percent of revenues increased to 7.1% in
    2006 from 6.5% in 2005.

Assets in the Commercial Segment declined $11.1 million or
    2%, primarily due to the decrease in net property, plant and
    equipment and accounts receivable, offset, in part, by the
    impact of foreign currency exchange adjustments.

Liquidity and
    Capital Resources

Operating activities from continuing operations provided net
    cash of $283.1 million during 2007. Changes in our
    operating assets and liabilities during 2007 resulted in a net
    cash inflow of $63.3 million. The most significant change
    was a decrease in inventories of $62.4 million,
    $25 million of which is due to the resolution, in 2007, of
    operational inefficiencies experienced in the Medical segment
    during the consolidation of facilities and distribution centers
    in 2005 and 2006 and focused inventory reduction initiatives in
    the Arrow operations post-acquisition, and $29 million is
    the impact from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in
    the Arrow acquisition which was sold during 2007. Our financing
    activities from continuing operations during 2007 consisted
    primarily of new long-term borrowings of $1.6 billion in
    connection with the Arrow acquisition, the payment of fees of
    $21.6 million to obtain that debt, and the repayment of
    $463.4 million of debt. We repaid approximately
    $54.0 million of debt in connection with the Arrow
    acquisition and repaid approximately $386.6 million of
    long-term debt with the proceeds from the disposal of the
    automotive and industrial


businesses. Our investing activities from continuing operations
    during 2007 consisted primarily of payments for businesses
    acquired of $2.2 billion, of which $2.1 billion
    pertains to the acquisition of Arrow International. During 2007,
    we received proceeds of approximately $702.3 million from
    the sale of the Commercial Segment’s automotive and
    industrial business and the Aerospace Segment’s precision
    machined components business. Discontinued operations generated
    approximately $88.5 million of cash flow in 2007.

In connection with the October 2007 acquisition of Arrow, the
    Company entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase
    Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., as
    syndication agent, the guarantors party thereto, the lenders
    party thereto and each other party thereto (“the Senior
    Credit Facility”). The Senior Credit Facility provides for
    a five-year term loan facility of $1.4 billion and a
    five-year revolving line of credit facility of
    $400 million, both of which carry initial interest rates of
    LIBOR + 150 basis points. The Company executed an interest
    rate swap for $600 million of the term loan from a floating
    3 month LIBOR rate to a fixed rate of 4.75%. The
    obligations under the Senior Credit Facility are guaranteed by
    substantially all of the material wholly-owned domestic
    subsidiaries of the Company, and are secured by a pledge of the
    shares of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries.

In addition, the Company (i) entered into a Note Purchase
    Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2007, among Teleflex
    Incorporated and the several purchasers party thereto (the
    “Note Purchase Agreement”) and issued $200,000,000 in
    new senior secured notes pursuant thereto (the “2007
    notes”), (ii) amended the terms of the note purchase
    agreement dated July 8, 2004 and the notes issued pursuant
    thereto (the “2004 Notes”) and the note purchase
    agreement dated October 25, 2002 and the notes issued
    pursuant thereto (the “2002 Notes” and, together with
    the 2004 Notes, the “amended notes”) and
    (iii) repaid $10.5 million of notes issued pursuant to
    the note agreements dated November 1, 1992 and
    December 15, 1993 (the “retired notes”). The
    retired notes consisted of the 7.40% Senior Notes due
    November 15, 2007 and the 6.80% Senior Notes,
    Series B due December 15, 2008.

The 2007 notes and the amended notes, referred to collectively
    as the “senior notes”, rank pari passu in right of
    repayment with the Company’s obligations under the Senior
    Credit Facility (the “primary bank obligations”) and
    are secured and guaranteed in the same manner as the Senior
    Credit Facility. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has been appointed as
    the collateral agent with respect to the collateral pledged
    under the Senior Credit Facility and the senior note agreements.
    The senior notes have mandatory prepayment requirements upon the
    sale of certain assets and may be accelerated upon certain
    events of default, in each case, on the same basis as the Senior
    Credit facility.

The interest rates payable on the amended notes were also
    modified in connection with the foregoing transactions.
    Effective October 1, 2007, (a) the 2004 Notes will
    bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at the
    following rates: (i) 7.66% in respect of the

Series 2004-1

Tranche A Senior Notes due 2011; (ii) 8.14% in respect
    of the

Series 2004-1

Tranche B Senior Notes due 2014; and (iii) 8.46% in
    respect of the

Series 2004-1

Tranche C Senior Notes due 2016; and (b) the 2002
    Notes will bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at
    the rate of 7.82% per annum. Interest rates on the amended notes
    are subject to reduction based on positive performance relative
    to financial covenants.

Fixed rate borrowings, excluding the effect of derivative
    instruments, comprised 34% of total borrowings at
    December 31, 2007. Fixed rate borrowings, including the
    effect of derivative instruments, comprised 69% of total
    borrowings at December 31, 2007. Approximately 4% of our
    total borrowings of $1,684.3 million are denominated in
    currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the euro.

The Senior Credit Facility and the agreements with the holders
    of the senior notes contain covenants that, among other things,
    limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its
    subsidiaries to incur debt, create liens, consolidate, merge or
    dispose of certain assets, make certain investments, engage in
    acquisitions, pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions
    in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements.
    Under the most restrictive of these provisions, on an annual
    basis $75 million of retained earnings was available for
    dividends and stock repurchases at December 31, 2007. The
    Senior Credit Facility and the senior note agreements also


require the Company to maintain
    certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios.
    Currently, the Company is required to maintain a consolidated
    leverage ratio (defined in the Senior Credit Facility as
    “Consolidated Leverage Ratio”) of not more than 4.75
    to 1 and an interest coverage ratio (defined in the Senior
    Credit Facility as “Consolidated Interest Coverage
    Ratio”) of not less than 3 to 1.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with
    the terms of the Senior Bank Loan and the senior notes. For
    additional information regarding our indebtedness, please see
    Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In addition to the cash generated from operations, we have
    approximately $352 million available in committed financing
    through the Senior Credit Facility. The availability of loans
    under this facility is dependent upon us maintaining our
    financial condition including our continued compliance with bank
    covenants. See note 8 for further disclosure of the covenants.

During 2007 the Company repatriated approximately
    $208 million of cash from its foreign subsidiaries,
    exclusive of proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations.
    During the fourth quarter of 2005, in order to take advantage of
    the provisions of the AJCA, management executed a foreign
    earnings repatriation plan. Under this plan, we repatriated
    $304 million of dividends during November and December
    2005. Cash repatriated in 2006 was less than $2 million.

Operating activities from continuing operations provided net
    cash of approximately $198.5 million during 2006. Changes
    in our operating assets and liabilities during 2006 resulted in
    a net cash inflow of $5.7 million. The most significant
    change was a decrease in accounts receivable, which was
    primarily due to improved cash collection. Our financing
    activities during 2006 consisted primarily of purchases of
    shares of our common stock of $93.6 million, a reduction in
    long-term borrowings of $55.0 million, a decrease in notes
    payable and current borrowings of $59.9 million, and
    payment of dividends of $44.1 million. Our investing
    activities during 2006 consisted primarily of capital
    expenditures of $40.8 million and payments for businesses
    acquired of $37.4 million. During 2006, we also made a
    $6.0 million payment in connection with a post-closing
    purchase price adjustment based on working capital for a
    divested business. Discontinued operations generated
    approximately $114.3 million of cash flow.

Operating activities from continuing operations provided net
    cash of approximately $238.4 million during 2005. Changes
    in our operating assets and liabilities during 2005 resulted in
    a net cash inflow of $67.3 million. The most significant
    change was a decrease in accounts receivable, which was
    primarily due to improved cash collection including the sale of
    certain receivables under a non-recourse securitization program.
    Our financing activities during 2005 consisted primarily of a
    reduction of long-term borrowings of $270.3 million as a
    result of improved cash flow, the repatriation of foreign
    earnings, and proceeds from the disposition of businesses.
    During 2005 we also paid dividends to minority shareholders of
    $62.5 million and made purchases of shares of our common
    stock of $46.5 million. Our investing activities in 2005
    consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of businesses and
    assets of $132.3 million. Discontinued operations
    contributed approximately $81.0 million of cash flow.

We use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain
    access to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs. As
    currently structured, we sell certain trade receivables on a
    non-recourse basis to a consolidated special purpose entity
    which in turn sells interests in those receivables to a
    commercial paper conduit. The conduit issues notes secured by
    those interests to third party investors. The assets of the
    special purpose entity are not available to satisfy our
    obligations. The total amount of accounts receivable sold to the
    special purpose entity were $124.3 million and
    $171.5 million at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, respectively. The special purpose entity
    has received cash consideration of $39.7 million and
    $40.0 million for the interests in the accounts receivable
    it has sold to the commercial paper conduit at December 31,
    2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, which amounts
    were removed from the consolidated balance sheet at such dates
    in accordance with SFAS 140, “Accounting for Transfers
    and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities”.


On June 14, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of
    outstanding Company common stock. Repurchases of Company stock
    under the program may be made from time to time in the open
    market and may include privately-negotiated transactions as
    market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory
    considerations. The stock repurchase program has no expiration
    date and the Company’s ability to execute on the program
    will depend on, among other factors, cash requirements for
    acquisitions, cash generation from operations, debt repayment
    obligations, market conditions and regulatory requirements. In
    addition, under the senior loan agreements entered into
    October 1, 2007, the Company is subject to certain
    restrictions relating to its ability to repurchase shares in the
    event the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio exceeds
    certain levels, which further limit the Company’s ability
    to repurchase shares under this program. Through
    December 31, 2007, no shares have been purchased under this
    plan.

On July 25, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $140 million of our outstanding common
    stock over twelve months ended July 2006. In June 2006, our
    Board of Directors extended for an additional six months, until
    January 2007, its authorization for the repurchase of shares.
    Under the Board’s authorization, we repurchased a total of
    2,317,347 shares on the open market during 2005 and 2006
    for an aggregate purchase price of $140.0 million, and
    aggregate fees and commissions of $0.1 million, with
    1,627,247 shares repurchased during 2006 for an aggregate
    purchase price of $93.5 million, and aggregate fees and
    commissions of $0.1 million.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of
    $68.5 million and $50.5 million at December 31,
    2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, relates
    principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain
    deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards
    in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate
    sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits
    related to the remaining net deferred tax asset. The valuation
    allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,”
    which requires that a valuation allowance be established and
    maintained when it is “more likely than not” that all
    or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
    valuation allowance increase in 2007 was primarily attributable
    to the recording of deferred tax assets associated with state
    tax loss carryforwards at full value which required a valuation
    allowance.

The increase in our percent of net debt to total capital for

    associated with the Arrow acquisition.

We believe that our cash flow from operations and our ability to
    access additional funds through credit facilities will enable us
    to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures and
    meet debt obligations.

    obligations relate primarily to material purchase requirements.

We also have obligations with respect to income tax
    uncertainties and our pension and other postretirement benefit
    plans. See Notes 12 and 13, respectively to our
    consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K

for additional information.

The Company’s contractual obligations at December 31,
    2007 are significantly different than at December 31, 2006
    due to the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of
    Arrow International in 2007 and to the divestiture of businesses
    in its Commercial and Aerospace segments in 2007.

Off Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

We have residual value guarantees under operating leases for
    plant and equipment. The maximum potential amount of future
    payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is
    approximately $1.9 million.

We use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain
    access to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs. As
    currently structured, we sell certain trade receivables on a
    non-recourse basis to a consolidated special purpose entity
    which in turn sells interests in those receivables to a
    commercial paper conduit. The conduit issues notes secured by
    those interests to third party investors. The assets of the
    special purpose entity are not available to satisfy our
    obligations. The total amount of accounts receivable sold to the
    special purpose entity were $124.3 million and
    $171.5 million at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, respectively. The special purpose entity
    has received cash consideration of $39.7 million and
    $40.0 million for the interests in the accounts receivable
    it has sold to the commercial paper conduit at December 31,
    2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, which amounts
    were removed from the consolidated balance sheet at such dates
    in accordance with SFAS 140, “Accounting for Transfers
    and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities”.

See also Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
    at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.


We have identified the following as critical accounting
    estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of
    significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive
    and important to the presentation of our financial condition and
    results of operations and could potentially result in materially
    different results under different assumptions and conditions.

Inventory
    Utilization

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Inherent
    in this valuation are significant management judgments and
    estimates concerning excess inventory and obsolescence rates.
    Based upon these judgments and estimates, we record a reserve to
    adjust the carrying amount of our inventories. We regularly
    compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or
    forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate
    obsolescence and excessive quantities. In assessing historical
    usage, we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate
    the reasonableness of using historical information as an
    estimate of future usage. Our inventory reserve was
    $35.9 million and $46.6 million at December 31,
    2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.

Accounting for
    Long-Lived Assets and Investments

The ability to realize long-lived assets is evaluated
    periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible
    inability to recover their carrying amount. Such evaluation is
    based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow
    projections. The analyses necessarily involve significant
    management judgment. Any impairment loss, if indicated, is
    measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
    exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.

Accounting for
    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we perform an annual
    impairment test of our recorded goodwill. In addition, we test
    our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
    These impairment tests can be significantly altered by estimates
    of future performance, long-term discount rates and market price
    valuation multiples. These estimates will likely change over
    time. Several of our businesses operate in cyclical industries
    and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to
    fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality. Goodwill and other
    intangible assets totaled $2,587.8 million and
    $725.8 million at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, respectively.

Acquired
    In-Process Research and Development

In connection with the acquisition of Arrow International, the
    Company recorded a $30 million charge to operations during
    2007, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business
    Combinations”, for in-process research and development
    (“IPR&D”) assets acquired that the Company
    determined had no alternative future use in their current state.

As part of the preliminary purchase price allocation for Arrow,
    approximately $30 million of the purchase price has been
    allocated to acquire in-process research and development
    projects. The amount allocated to the acquired in-process
    research and development represents the estimated value based on
    risk-adjusted cash flows related to in-process projects that
    have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no
    alternative future uses as of the date of the acquisition. The
    primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of
    these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the
    underlying products. If the projects are not successful or
    completed in a timely manner, the Company may not realize the
    financial benefits expected for these projects.

The value assigned to the acquired in-process technology was
    determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired
    technology into commercially viable products, estimating the
    resulting net cash flows from the projects, and discounting the
    net cash flows to their present value. The revenue projections
    used to value the acquired in-process research and development
    was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth
    factors, expected trends in technology, and the nature and
    expected timing of new product


introductions by us and our competitors. The resulting net cash
    flows from such projects were based on our estimates of cost of
    sales, operating expenses, and income taxes from such projects.

The rate of 14 percent utilized to discount the net cash
    flows to their present value was based on estimated cost of
    capital calculations and the implied rate of return from the
    Company’s acquisition model plus a risk premium. Due to the
    nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the
    developmental projects, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates
    were used for the in-process research and development projects.
    The discount rates are based on the stage of completion and
    uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the
    purchased in-process technology projects.

The purchased in-process technology of Arrow relates to research
    and development projects in the following product families:
    Central Venus Access Catheters (“CVC”) and Specialty
    Care Catheters (“Specialty Care”).

The most significant purchased set of in-process technologies
    relates to the CVC Product Family for which the Company has
    estimated a value of $25 million. The projects included in
    this product family’s in-process technology include the
    Hi-C Project, PICC Triple Lumen, Antimicrobial PICC, and the
    Elcam-Catheter Tip Positioning Technology. It is anticipated
    that CVC in-process technologies will begin producing revenues
    sometime in 2008, subject to receipt of appropriate regulatory
    approvals. Material net cash inflows (net of operating costs,
    including costs to complete clinical trials) from the use of the
    CVC in-process technologies are expected to commence in 2009.
    The estimated remaining total costs to complete these clinical
    trials are expected to be approximately $4 million.

The remaining purchased set of in-process technologies relates
    to the Specialty Care Product Family for which the Company has
    estimated a value of $5 million. The projects included in
    this product family’s in-process technology include the
    Ethanol Lock Program and Antimicrobial CHDC. It is anticipated
    that Specialty Care in-process technologies will begin producing
    revenues sometime in 2008, subject to receipt of appropriate
    regulatory approvals. Material net cash inflows (net of
    operating costs, including costs to complete clinical trials)
    from the use of the Specialty Care in-process technologies are
    expected to commence in 2009. The estimated remaining total
    costs to complete these clinical trials are expected to be
    approximately $3 million to $4 million.

The successful development of new products and product
    enhancements is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,
    both known and unknown, including unanticipated delays, access
    to capital, budget overruns, technical problems and other
    difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial
    change in the design, development and commercialization of these
    new products and enhancements, including, for example, changes
    requested by the FDA in connection with pre-market approval
    applications for products or 510(k) notification. Given the
    uncertainties inherent with product development and
    introduction, there can be no assurance that any of the
    Company’s product development efforts will be successful on
    a timely basis or within budget, if at all. The failure of the
    Company to develop new products and product enhancements on a
    timely basis or within budget could harm the Company’s
    results of operations and financial condition. For additional
    risks that may affect the Company’s business and prospects
    following completion of the merger, see “Risk Factors”
    commencing on page 12 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Accounting for
    Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

We provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired
    employees, including pensions and postretirement healthcare.
    Several statistical and other factors which are designed to
    project future events are used in calculating the expense and
    liability related to these plans. These factors include
    actuarial assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of
    return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates
    and healthcare cost trend rates. We review the actuarial
    assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the
    assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.

Significant differences in our actual experience or significant
    changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and
    other postretirement obligations and our future expense. A
    50 basis point increase in the


assumed discount rate would have
    decreased the total net periodic pension and postretirement
    healthcare expense for 2007 by approximately $1.2 million
    and would have decreased the projected benefit obligation at
    December 31, 2007 by approximately $23.0 million. A
    50 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would
    have increased these amounts by approximately $1.5 million
    and $24.8 million, respectively. A 50 basis point
    change in the expected return on plan assets would have impacted
    2007 annual pension expense by approximately $1.0 million.
    A 1.0% increase in the assumed healthcare trend rate would have
    increased the 2007 benefit expense by approximately
    $0.3 million and would have increased the projected benefit
    obligation by approximately $4.0 million. A 1.0% decrease
    in the assumed healthcare trend rate would have decreased the
    2007 benefit expense by approximately $0.2 million and
    would have decreased the projected benefit obligation by
    approximately $3.5 million.

Accounting for
    Restructuring Costs

Restructuring costs, which include termination benefits,
    contract termination costs and other restructuring costs, are
    recorded at estimated fair value. Key assumptions in calculating
    the restructuring costs include the terms that may be negotiated
    to exit certain contractual obligations and the timing of
    employees leaving the company.

Accounting for
    Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts
    receivable when the collection of the full amount of the account
    is doubtful. The allowance is based on our historical
    experience, the period an account is outstanding, the financial
    position of the customer and information provided by credit
    rating services. We review the allowance periodically and adjust
    it as necessary. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was
    $10.2 million at December 31, 2007 and
    $10.1 million at December 31, 2006.

Product Warranty
    Liability

Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions for the
    repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a
    specified period after the time of the sales. We estimate our
    warranty costs and liability based on a number of factors
    including historical trends of units sold, the status of
    existing claims, recall programs and communication with
    customers. Our estimated product warranty liability was
    $20.0 million and $14.1 million at December 31,
    2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

Our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the
    deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess
    uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize
    estimates. We conduct a broad range of operations around the
    world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous
    international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax
    audits, disputes and potentially litigation, the outcome of
    which is uncertain. Management must make judgments about such
    uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and
    liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future
    adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities will be necessary.
    Our income taxes payable was $85.8 million and
    $16.1 million at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, respectively.

We are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred
    tax assets, taking into consideration our forecast of future
    taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could
    be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this
    assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and amount
    of, valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. To the
    extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments
    to the valuation allowances may be required.

We are required to assess whether the earnings of our foreign
    subsidiaries will be permanently reinvested in the respective
    foreign jurisdictions or if previously untaxed foreign earnings
    of the Company will no longer be


permanently reinvested and thus
    become taxable in the United States. As a result of the Arrow
    acquisition, we reconsidered our position with respect to
    recognition of deferred tax liabilities on outside basis
    differences (including undistributed earnings) relating to
    foreign subsidiaries. As a result, deferred taxes were provided
    in the third quarter with respect to $301.5 million of
    undistributed foreign earnings. In addition, deferred taxes were
    provided with respect to $49.4 million of undistributed
    foreign earnings of Arrow foreign subsidiaries. In connection
    with the sale of our automotive and industrial businesses, we
    determined that

non-U.S. proceeds

from the sale totaling approximately $267.7 million would
    also be repatriated in the foreseeable future. We remain
    permanently reinvested with respect to the remainder of our
    foreign undistributed earnings.

Significant judgment is required in determining income tax
    provisions under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 109 “Accounting for Income Taxes”
    (SFAS No. 109) and in evaluating tax positions.
    We establish additional provisions for income taxes when,
    despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable,
    there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum
    probability threshold, as defined by FASB Interpretation
    (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes — An Interpretation of FASB Statement
    109” (“FIN 48”), which is a tax position
    that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by
    the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of
    business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by
    various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities. We regularly
    assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any
    future examinations for the current or prior years in
    determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We
    continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential
    adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax
    liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts
    that give rise to a revision become known.

See Note 12 for additional information regarding the
    Company’s uncertain tax positions.

Accounting
    Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted

Fair Value Measurements:

In September 2006,
    the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
    (“SFAS”) No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (SFAS No. 157).
    SFAS No. 157 establishes a common definition for fair
    value to be applied to US GAAP requiring use of fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
    disclosure about such fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007.

In February 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 157-2

“Partial Deferral of the Effective Date of Statement
    157”

(FSP 157-2).

FSP 157-2

delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157, for all
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows.

Fair Value Option:

In February 2007, the FASB
    issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — including
    an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115,” which permits
    an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial
    liabilities at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
    reported in earnings at each subsequent measurement date. The
    fair value option may be elected on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis, as long as it is applied to the instrument in its
    entirety. The fair value option election is irrevocable, unless
    an event specified in SFAS No. 159 occurs that results
    in a new election date. This statement is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 159 on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows.

Business Combinations:

In December 2007, the
    FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), “Business
    Combinations”. SFAS No. 141(R) replaces FASB
    Statement No. 141, “Business Combinations”.
    SFAS No. 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements
    in Statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting
    (which Statement 141 called the

purchase method

) be used
    for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be
    identified for each business combination.
    SFAS No. 141(R) defines the acquirer as the entity
    that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business
    combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date
    that the acquirer


achieves control. SFAS No. 141(R)’s scope is
    broader than that of Statement 141, which applied only to
    business combinations in which control was obtained by
    transferring consideration.

SFAS No. 141(R) replaces Statement 141’s
    cost-allocation process and requires an acquirer to recognize
    the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date,
    measured at their fair values as of that date, with limited
    exceptions. In addition, SFAS No. 141(R) changes the
    allocation and treatment of acquisition-related costs,
    restructuring costs that the acquirer expected but was not
    obligated to incur, the recognition of assets and liabilities
    assumed arising from contingencies and the recognition and
    measurement of goodwill. This statement is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008 and is to be
    applied prospectively to business combinations. The Company is
    currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 141(R) on
    its consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Noncontrolling Interests:

In December 2007,
    the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an
    amendment of ARB No. 51”. SFAS No. 160
    amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards
    for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, sometimes
    referred to as minority interest, and for the deconsolidation of
    a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a
    subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity
    that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial
    statements. SFAS No. 160 requires that a
    noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries held by parties other
    than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and presented in
    the consolidated statement of financial position within equity,
    but separate from the parent’s equity; that the amount of
    consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the
    noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on
    the face of the consolidated statement of income; that the
    changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent
    retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be
    accounted for consistently as equity transactions; and that when
    a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling
    equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured
    at fair value. This statement is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008; earlier adoption is
    prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
    SFAS No. 160 on the Company’s financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market
    Risk

We are exposed to certain financial risks, specifically
    fluctuations in market interest rates, foreign currency exchange
    rates and, to a lesser extent, commodity prices. We use
    derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact
    of some of these risks. All instruments are entered into for
    other than trading purposes. We are also exposed to changes in
    the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the
    valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings.

Interest Rate
    Risk

We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our
    borrowing activities and our cash balances. Interest rate swaps
    are used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk. The
    table below is an analysis of the amortization and related
    interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable
    rate debt obligations. Variable interest rates shown below are
    weighted average rates of the debt portfolio based on
    December 31,


2007 rates. For the swaps, notional amounts and related interest
    rates are shown by year of maturity. The fair value, net of tax
    of the interest rate swap as of December 31, 2007 was a
    loss of $8.9 million.

The notional value of the interest rate swap is

    value of $350 million at maturity in 2012.

A 1.0% change in variable interest rates would adversely or
    positively impact our expected net earnings by approximately
    $3.2 million, for the period ended December 31, 2008.

Foreign Currency
    Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in market values of transactions
    in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain
    subsidiaries. We have entered into forward contracts with
    several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of
    projected cash flows from these exposures. These are all
    contracts to buy or sell a foreign currency against the
    U.S. dollar. The fair value of the open forward contracts
    as of December 31, 2007 was less than $0.1 million.
    The following table presents our open forward currency contracts
    as of December 31, 2007, which mature in 2008 and 2009.
    Forward contract notional amounts presented below are expressed
    in the stated currencies (in thousands). The total notional
    amount for all contracts translates to approximately
    $98 million.

A movement of 10% in the value of the U.S. dollar against

    approximately $2.5 million.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
    of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
    period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
    that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
    period covered by this report are functioning effectively to
    provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be
    disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to
    our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute
    assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system
    are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
    any, within a company have been detected.

    Financial Reporting

Our management’s report on internal control over financial
    reporting is set forth on

page F-2

of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and is incorporated by reference herein.

(c) Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No change in our internal control over financial reporting
    occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has
    materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting except for
    the following:

As a result of our acquisition of Arrow International, Inc.
    (“Arrow”) in October 2007, our internal control over
    financial reporting now includes the operation of the businesses
    from Arrow. These controls were excluded from our
    Section 404 assessment in 2007.

In October 2007, the Company implemented a new Enterprise
    Resource Planning (“ERP”) system providing full supply
    chain operation functionality at all US and Mexican facilities
    supporting the Medical Products and Surgical Devices business.
    The ERP solution provider chosen was SAP and is readily
    available, industry standard software. The now operational ERP
    system replaced multiple legacy financial systems. As a result
    of this implementation, several of the Company’s underlying
    business processes were modified

and/or

redesigned to conform with and support the consolidated ERP
    platform. This new ERP system and the related processes were
    included within the scope of management’s assessment and
    testing of its internal controls for 2007.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Teleflex Incorporated and its subsidiaries
    (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
    Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
    expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
    and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
    the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
    the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, management
    used the framework established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). As a result of this assessment and based on the criteria
    in the COSO framework, management has concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2007, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective.

Management has excluded Arrow International Inc.
    (“Arrow”) from its assessment of internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 since it was
    acquired in a purchase business combination during the fourth
    quarter of 2007. Arrow is a wholly-owned subsidiary with total
    assets as of December 31, 2007 of $2.4 billion and
    total revenues of $134 million since the date of
    acquisition.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears
    herein.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Teleflex
    Incorporated:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of Teleflex Incorporated and its
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and December 31,
    2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, December 31,
    2006, and December 25, 2005 in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
    listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting, appearing on

page F-2.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for share-based compensation in 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Arrow
    International Inc. (“Arrow”) from its assessment of
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007 because it was acquired by the Company in
    a purchase business combination during 2007. We have also
    excluded Arrow from our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting. Arrow is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets
    and total revenues represent $2.4 billion and
    $134 million, respectively, of the related consolidated
    financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in
    thousands, except per share)

Note 1 —

Summary of
    significant accounting policies

Consolidation:

The consolidated financial
    statements include the accounts of Teleflex Incorporated and its
    subsidiaries (the “Company”). Also, in accordance with
    FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46(R),
    “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” the
    Company consolidates variable interest entities in which it
    bears a majority of the risk of the potential losses or gains
    from a majority of the expected returns. Intercompany
    transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in
    affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but
    not a controlling equity interest are carried on the equity
    basis. Investments in affiliates over which the Company does not
    have significant influence are accounted for by the cost method.
    In 2007, the Company changed the fiscal year end from the last
    Sunday in December to December 31. This change is effective
    commencing with the 2007 fiscal year. These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America and include management’s estimates and assumptions
    that affect the recorded amounts.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair values:

The estimated fair value amounts
    presented in these consolidated financial statements have been
    determined by the Company using available market information and
    appropriate methodologies. However, considerable judgment is
    required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of
    fair value. The use of different market assumptions

and/or

estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the
    estimated fair value amounts. Such fair value estimates are
    based on pertinent information available to management as of
    December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006.

Cash and cash equivalents:

All highly liquid
    debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or
    less are classified as cash equivalents. The carrying value of
    cash equivalents approximates their current market value.

Accounts receivable:

Accounts receivable
    represents amounts due from customers related to the sale of
    products. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained and
    represents the Company’s estimate of probable losses on
    realization of the full receivable. The allowance is provided at
    such time that management believes reasonable doubt exists that
    such balances will be collected within a reasonable period of
    time. The allowance is based on the Company’s historical
    experience, the period an account is outstanding, the financial
    position of the customer and information provided by credit
    rating services. The allowance for doubtful accounts was
    $10.2 million and $10.1 million as of
    December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at the
    lower of cost or market. The cost of the Company’s
    inventories is determined by the

“first-in,

first-out” method for catheter and related product
    inventories and by the average cost method for other inventory
    categories. Elements of cost in inventory include raw materials,
    direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. In estimating market
    value, the Company evaluates inventory for excess and obsolete
    quantities based on estimated usage and sales.

Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant
    and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated
    depreciation. Costs incurred to develop internal-use computer
    software during the application development stage generally are
    capitalized. Costs of enhancements to internal-use computer
    software are capitalized, provided that these enhancements
    result in additional functionality. Other additions and those
    improvements

F-8

TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

which increase the capacity or
    lengthen the useful lives of the assets are also capitalized.
    With minor exceptions, straight-line composite lives for
    depreciation of property, plant and equipment are as follows:
    land improvements — 5 years;
    buildings — 30 years

;

machinery and
    equipment — 3 to 10 years; computer equipment and
    software — 3 to 5 years. Leasehold improvements
    are depreciated over the remaining lease periods. Repairs and
    maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and other intangible assets:

Goodwill
    and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not
    amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or
    more frequently if there is a triggering event. Impairment
    losses, if any, are recorded as part of income from operations.
    The goodwill impairment test is applied to each of the
    Company’s reporting units. A reporting unit is the
    operating segment, or a business one level below that operating
    segment (the component level) if discrete financial information
    is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.
    However, components are aggregated as a single reporting unit if
    they have similar economic characteristics. The goodwill
    impairment test is applied using a two-step approach. In the
    first step, the Company estimates the fair values of its
    reporting units using the present value of future cash flows
    approach. If the reporting unit carrying amount exceeds the fair
    value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is
    performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
    In the second step, the implied fair value of the goodwill is
    estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit used in the
    first step less the fair values of all net tangible and
    intangible assets of the reporting unit other than goodwill. If
    the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair
    market value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount
    equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of the
    goodwill. For other indefinite lived intangible assets, the
    impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of
    the intangible assets to their carrying amounts.

The Company performs its annual impairment test of its recorded
    goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth
    quarter each year unless interim indications of impairment
    exist. In 2007 and 2006, following the process described in the
    preceding paragraph, it determined that a portion of its
    goodwill was impaired and recorded a charge of
    $18.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively. No
    instances of impairments were found in 2005.

Intangible assets consisting of intellectual property, customer
    lists and distribution rights are being amortized over their
    estimated useful lives, which are as follows: intellectual
    property 3 to 20 years, customer lists 5 to 30 years,
    distribution rights 3 to 22 years. The weighted average
    amortization period is 17 years. Tradenames of
    $330 million are considered indefinite lived. The Company
    continually evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of
    these assets. During 2007, the company terminated certain
    contractual relationships that resulted in an impairment charge
    of $2.5 million which is included in restructuring and
    other impairment charges.

Long-lived assets:

The ability to realize
    long-lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or
    circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their
    carrying amount. Such evaluation is based on various analyses,
    including undiscounted cash flow and profitability projections
    that incorporate, as applicable, the impact on the existing
    business. The analyses necessarily involve significant
    management judgment. Any impairment loss, if indicated, is
    measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
    exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.

Product warranty liability:

Product warranty
    liability arises out of the need to repair or replace product
    without charge to the customer. The Company warrants such
    products from manufacturing defect. The Company estimates its
    warranty liability based on historical trends of units sold, the
    status of existing claims, recall programs and communication
    with customers.

Foreign currency translation:

Assets and
    liabilities of non-domestic subsidiaries denominated in local
    currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of
    exchange at the balance sheet date; income and expenses are
    translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during
    the year. The resultant translation adjustments are reported as
    a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
    shareholders’ equity.

Derivative financial instruments:

The Company
    uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of
    hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. All instruments are entered into for
    other than trading purposes. All derivatives are recognized on
    the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
    derivatives are recorded in earnings or other comprehensive
    income, based on whether the instrument is designated as part of
    a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction.
    Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other
    comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in the period
    in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item.
    The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in current
    period earnings. If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly
    effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction
    will no longer occur, gains or losses on the derivative are
    recorded in current period earnings.

Stock-based compensation:

On December 26,
    2005, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” which requires
    the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
    stock-based awards made to employees based on estimated fair
    values. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes previous accounting
    under Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion
    No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees,” for periods beginning in fiscal 2006. In March
    2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”)
    No. 107, providing supplemental guidance for
    SFAS No. 123(R). The Company has applied the
    provisions of SAB No. 107 in its adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R).

Share-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS
    No. 123(R) for 2007 and 2006 was $7.5 million and
    $6.8 million, respectively and is included in selling,
    engineering and administrative expenses. The total income tax
    benefit recognized for share-based compensation arrangements for
    2007 and 2006 was $1.5 million and $1.4 million,
    respectively.

As of December 31, 2007, unamortized share-based
    compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, net of
    expected forfeitures, was $5.4 million, which is expected
    to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    1.65 years. Unamortized share-based compensation cost
    related to non-vested shares (restricted stock), net of expected
    forfeitures, was $2.6 million, which is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.

SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to estimate the
    fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an
    option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that
    is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the
    requisite service periods. The Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective
    application method. The Company’s consolidated financial
    statements for 2006 and 2007 reflect the impact of
    SFAS No. 123(R).

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company
    accounted for stock-based awards to employees using the
    intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No. 25, as
    allowed under SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation.” Under the intrinsic value
    method, no stock-based compensation expense for employee stock
    options had been recognized in the Company’s consolidated
    statements of operations because the exercise price of the
    Company’s stock options granted to employees equaled the
    fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant.
    In accordance with the modified prospective transition method
    the Company used in adopting SFAS No. 123(R), the
    Company’s results of operations prior to fiscal 2006 have
    not been retroactively adjusted to reflect, and do not include,
    the impact of SFAS No. 123(R).

Stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is
    based on the value of the portion of stock-based awards that is
    ultimately expected to vest during the period. Stock-based
    compensation expense recognized in 2006 and 2007 included
    compensation expense for (1) stock-based awards granted
    prior to, but not yet vested as of December 25, 2005, based
    on the fair value on the grant date estimated in accordance with
    the pro forma provisions of SFAS No. 123 and
    (2) compensation expense for the stock-based awards granted
    subsequent to December 25, 2005, based on the fair value on
    the grant date estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R). As stock-based compensation expense
    recognized for fiscal 2006 and 2007 is based on awards
    ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated
    forfeitures. SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to
    be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in
    subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
    estimates.

The following table illustrates the pro forma net income and
    earnings per share for 2005 as if compensation expense for stock
    options issued to employees had been determined consistent with
    SFAS No. 123:

Stock-based compensation expense is measured using a multiple
    point Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account
    highly subjective and complex assumptions. The expected life of
    options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award,
    as well as historical exercise behavior, and represents the
    period of time that options granted are expected to be
    outstanding. Expected volatilities are based on a blend of
    historical volatility and implied volatility derived from
    publicly traded options to purchase the Company’s common
    stock, which the Company believes is more reflective of the
    market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility
    than solely using historical volatility. The risk-free interest
    rate is the implied yield currently available on
    U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term
    equal to the expected life of the option.

The fair value for options granted in 2007 and 2006 was
    estimated at the date of grant using a multiple point
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value for options
    granted in 2005 was estimated at the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following
    weighted-average assumptions were used:

Awards,” that allows for a simplified method to establish

    on the APIC Pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of
    the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that
    are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).
    During the second quarter of 2006, the Company elected to adopt
    the simplified method.

See Note 11 for additional information regarding the
    Company’s stock compensation plans.

Income taxes:

The provision for income taxes
    is determined using the asset and liability approach of
    accounting for income taxes in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
    Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax
    consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for
    income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the
    current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
    Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and
    tax bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities and are
    adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are
    enacted. Provision has been made for income taxes on unremitted
    earnings of subsidiaries and affiliates, except for subsidiaries
    in which earnings are deemed to be permanently invested.

Significant judgment is required in determining income tax
    provisions under SFAS No. 109 and in evaluating tax
    positions. We establish additional provisions for income taxes
    when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully
    supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the
    minimum probability threshold, as defined by FASB Interpretation
    (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes — An Interpretation of FASB Statement
    109” (“FIN 48”), which is a tax position
    that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by
    the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of
    business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by
    various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities. We regularly
    assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any
    future examinations for the current or prior years in
    determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
    Interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and income
    tax related penalties are both included in taxes on income from
    continuing operations. We continually assess the likelihood and
    amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax
    provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the
    period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become
    known.

Pensions and other postretirement
    benefits:

The Company provides a range of
    benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including
    pensions and postretirement healthcare. The Company records
    annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations
    which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount
    rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, compensation
    increases, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. The
    Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and
    makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates
    and trends when appropriate. As required, the effect of the
    modifications is generally amortized over future periods.

Restructuring costs:

Restructuring costs,
    which include termination benefits, contract termination costs
    and other restructuring costs are recorded at estimated fair
    value. Key assumptions in calculating the restructuring costs
    include the terms that may be negotiated to exit certain
    contractual obligations and the timing of employees leaving the
    company.

Revenue recognition:

The Company recognizes
    revenues from product sales, including sales to distributors, or
    services provided when the following revenue recognition
    criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the
    selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is
    reasonably assured. This generally occurs when products are
    shipped, when services are rendered or upon customers’
    acceptance.

    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenues from product sales, net of estimated returns and other
    allowances based on historical experience and current trends,
    are recognized upon shipment of products to customers or
    distributors. Revenues from services provided are recognized as
    the services are rendered and comprised 9.9%, 10.7% and 10.3% of
    net revenues in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company considers the criteria presented in
    SFAS No. 48, “Revenue Recognition When Right of
    Return Exists,” in determining the appropriate revenue
    recognition treatment. The Company’s normal policy is to
    accept returns only in cases in which the product is defective
    and covered under the Company’s standard warranty
    provisions. However, in the limited cases where an arrangement
    provides a right of return to the customer, including a
    distributor, the Company believes it has the ability to
    reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on its
    substantial historical experience with respect to these
    arrangements. The Company accrues any costs or losses that may
    be expected in connection with any returns in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies.”
    Revenues and materials, labor and other product costs are
    reduced to reflect estimated returns.

The Company applies the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”) Issue

No. 01-09,

“Accounting for Consideration Given from a Vendor to a
    Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s
    Products),” to its customer incentive programs, which
    include discounts or rebates. Appropriate allowances are
    determined and recorded as a reduction of revenue.

Reclassifications:

Certain reclassifications
    have been made to the prior years’ consolidated financial
    statements to conform to current year presentation including
    discontinued operations (see Note 16). Certain financial
    information is presented on a rounded basis, which may cause
    minor differences.

Uncertain Tax Positions:

In June 2006, the
    FASB issued Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.”
    FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
    income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial
    statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN No. 48
    requires that the impact of a tax position be recognized in the
    financial statements if it is more likely than not that the tax
    position will be sustained on tax audit, based on the technical
    merits of the position. FIN No. 48 also provides
    guidance on derecognition of tax positions that do not meet the
    “more likely than not” standard, classification of tax
    assets and liabilities, interest and penalties, accounting in
    interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of
    FIN No. 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2006. In connection with its adoption of
    the provisions of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007,
    the Company recognized a charge of approximately
    $14.2 million to retained earnings.

See Note 12 for additional information regarding the
    Company’s uncertain tax positions.

Fair Value Measurements:

In September 2006,
    the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements”. SFAS No. 157 establishes a common
    definition for fair value to be applied to US GAAP requiring use
    of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value,
    and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007.

In February 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 157-2

“Partial Deferral of the Effective Date of Statement
    157”.

FSP 157-2

delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157, for all
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows.

Fair Value Option:

In February 2007, the FASB
    issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — including
    an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115,” which permits
    an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial
    liabilities at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
    reported in earnings at each subsequent measurement date. The
    fair value option may be elected on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis, as long as it is applied to the instrument in its
    entirety. The fair value option election is irrevocable, unless
    an event specified in SFAS No. 159 occurs that results
    in a new election date. This statement is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 159 on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows.

Business Combinations:

In December 2007, the
    FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), “Business
    Combinations”. SFAS No. 141(R) replaces FASB
    Statement No. 141, “Business Combinations”.
    SFAS No. 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements
    in Statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting
    (which Statement 141 called the

purchase method

) be used
    for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be
    identified for each business combination.
    SFAS No. 141(R) defines the acquirer as the entity
    that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business
    combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date
    that the acquirer achieves control.
    SFAS No. 141(R)’s scope is broader than that of
    Statement 141, which applied only to business combinations in
    which control was obtained by transferring consideration.

SFAS No. 141(R) replaces Statement 141’s
    cost-allocation process and requires an acquirer to recognize
    the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date,
    measured at their fair values as of that date, with limited
    exceptions. In addition, SFAS No. 141(R) changes the
    allocation and treatment of acquisition-related costs,
    restructuring costs that the acquirer expected but was not
    obligated to incur, the recognition of assets and liabilities
    assumed arising from contingencies and the recognition and
    measurement of goodwill. This statement is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008 and is to be
    applied prospectively to business combinations. The Company is
    currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 141R on its
    consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Noncontrolling Interests:

In December 2007,
    the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an
    amendment of ARB No. 51”. SFAS No. 160
    amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards
    for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, sometimes
    referred to as minority interest, and for the deconsolidation of
    a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a
    subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity
    that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial
    statements. SFAS No. 160 requires that a
    noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries held by parties other
    than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and presented in
    the consolidated statement of financial position within equity,
    but separate from the parent’s equity, that the amount of
    consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the
    noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on
    the face of the consolidated statement of income, that the
    changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent
    retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be
    accounted for consistently as equity transactions and that when
    a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling
    equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured
    at fair value. This statement is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption is
    prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
    SFAS No. 160 on the Company’s financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

    outstanding capital stock of Arrow International, Inc.
    (“Arrow”) for approximately $2.1 billion. Arrow
    is a global provider of catheter-based access and therapeutic

products for critical and cardiac care. The transaction was
    financed with cash, borrowings under a new senior secured
    syndicated bank loan and proceeds received through the issuance
    of privately placed notes. The results of operations for Arrow
    are included in the Company’s Medical Segment from the date
    of acquisition.

Under the terms of the transaction, the Company paid $45.50 per
    common share in cash, or $2,094.6 million in total, to
    acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Arrow. In
    addition, the Company paid $39.1 million in cash for
    outstanding stock options of Arrow. Pursuant to the terms of the
    agreement, upon the change in control of Arrow, Arrow’s
    outstanding stock options became fully vested and exercisable
    and were cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an
    amount for each share subject to the stock option, equal to the
    excess of $45.50 per share over the exercise price per share of
    each option. The aggregate purchase price of
    $2,104.0 million includes transaction costs of
    approximately $10.8 million.

In conjunction with the acquisition of Arrow, the Company repaid
    approximately $35.1 million of debt, representing
    substantially all of Arrow’s existing outstanding debt as
    of October 1, 2007.

The Company financed the all cash purchase price and related
    transaction costs associated with the Arrow acquisition, and the
    repayment of substantially all of Arrow’s outstanding debt
    with $1,672.0 million from borrowings under a new senior
    secured syndicated bank loan and proceeds received through the
    issuance of privately placed notes (see Note 10) and
    cash on hand of approximately $433.5 million.

The acquisition of Arrow was accounted for under the purchase
    method of accounting. As such, the cost to acquire Arrow was
    allocated to the respective assets and liabilities acquired
    based on their preliminary estimated fair values as of the
    closing date.

Certain assets acquired in the Arrow merger qualify for
    recognition as intangible assets apart from goodwill in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 141, “Business Combinations”. The preliminary
    estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired included
    customer related intangibles of

$498.7 million, trade names of $249.0 million and
    purchased technology of $153.4 million. Customer related
    intangibles have a useful life of 25 years and purchased
    technology have useful lives ranging from 7-15 years.
    Tradenames have an indefinite useful life. A portion of the
    purchase price allocation, $30 million, representing
    in-process research and development was deemed to have no future
    alternative use and was charged to expense as of the date of the
    combination. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

The amount of the purchase price allocated to the acquired
    in-process research and development represents the estimated
    value based on risk-adjusted cash flows related to in-process
    projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and
    have no alternative future uses as of the date of the
    acquisition. The primary basis for determining the technological
    feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval
    to market the underlying products.

The value assigned to the acquired in-process technology was
    determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired
    technology into commercially viable products, estimating the
    resulting net cash flows from the projects, and discounting the
    net cash flows to their present value using a rate of 14%. The
    revenue projections used to value the acquired in-process
    research and development was based on estimates of relevant
    market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology,
    and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions
    by us and our competitors. The resulting net cash flows from
    such projects were based on our estimates of cost of sales,
    operating expenses, and income taxes from such projects.

The purchased in-process technology of Arrow relates to research
    and development projects in the following product families:
    Central Venus Access Catheters (“CVC”) and Specialty
    Care Catheters (“Specialty Care”).

The most significant purchased set of in-process technologies
    relates to the CVC Product Family for which the Company has
    estimated a value of $25 million. The projects included in
    this product family’s in-process technology include the
    Hi-C Project, PICC Triple Lumen, Antimicrobial PICC, and the
    Elcam-Catheter Tip Positioning Technology. It is anticipated
    that CVC in-process technologies will begin producing revenues
    sometime in 2008, subject to receipt of appropriate regulatory
    approvals. Material net cash inflows (net of operating costs,
    including costs to complete clinical trials) from the use of the
    CVC in-process technologies are expected to commence in 2009.
    The estimated remaining total costs to complete these clinical
    trials are expected to be approximately $4 million.

The remaining purchased set of in-process technologies relates
    to the Specialty Care Product Family for which the Company has
    estimated a value of $5 million. The projects included in
    this product family’s in-process technology include the
    Ethanol Lock Program and Antimicrobial CHDC. It is anticipated
    that Specialty Care in-process technologies will begin producing
    revenues sometime in 2008, subject to receipt of appropriate
    regulatory approvals. Material net cash inflows (net of
    operating costs, including costs to complete clinical trials)
    from the use of the Specialty Care in-process technologies are
    expected to commence in 2009. The estimated remaining total
    costs to complete these clinical trials are expected to be
    approximately $3 million to $4 million.

Integration
    of Arrow

In connection with the acquisition of Arrow, the Company has
    formulated a plan related to the future integration of Arrow and
    the Company’s Medical businesses. The integration plan
    focuses on the closure of Arrow corporate functions and the
    consolidation of manufacturing, sales, marketing, and
    distribution functions in North America, Europe and Asia. Some
    portions of the plan have not as yet been finalized, however the
    Company does not expect the finalization of these programs to
    result in a material adjustment to the estimated costs to
    implement the plan.

The Company has recognized an aggregate amount of
    $31.6 million as a liability assumed in the acquisition of
    Arrow, and included in the allocation of the purchase price, for
    the estimated costs to carry out the integration plan. Of this
    amount, $18.4 million relate to employee termination costs,
    $4.3 million to

    incurred through the third quarter of 2010.

In conjunction with the plan for the integration of Arrow and
    the Company’s Medical businesses, the Company expects to
    take actions that affect employees and facilities of Teleflex.
    This aspect of the integration plan is explained in Note 4
    “Restructuring” and such costs incurred will be
    charged to earnings and included in “restructuring and
    impairment costs” within the consolidated statement of
    operations.

2007 Arrow
    Integration Program

In connection with the acquisition of Arrow, the Company has
    formulated a plan related to the future integration of Arrow and
    the Company’s Medical businesses. The integration plan
    focuses on the closure of Arrow corporate functions and the
    consolidation of manufacturing, sales, marketing, and
    distribution functions in North America, Europe and Asia. In as
    much as the actions affect employees and facilities of Arrow,
    the resultant costs have been included in the allocation of the
    purchase price of Arrow. Costs related to actions that affect
    employees and facilities of Teleflex will be charged to earnings
    and included in “restructuring and impairment costs”
    within the consolidated statement of operations. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company estimates that an aggregate
    of approximately $25-30 million will be charged to
    restructuring and other impairment costs when actions are taken
    or costs are incurred in 2008 and 2009 in connection with this
    plan. Of this amount, $12-14 million relates to employee
    termination costs, $4-5 million relates to facility closure
    costs and $9-11 million relates to termination of certain
    distribution agreements and other actions. The charges
    associated with this restructuring program that are included in
    restructuring and other impairment charges during 2007 were as

    Restructuring Program

In June 2006, the Company began certain restructuring
    initiatives that affected all three of the Company’s
    reporting segments. These initiatives involved the consolidation
    of operations and a related reduction in workforce at several of
    the Company’s facilities in Europe and North America. The
    Company has determined to undertake these initiatives as a means
    to improving operating performance and to better leverage the
    Company’s existing resources.

    consolidation of facilities in the Company’s Commercial
    Segment. Other restructuring costs include expenses primarily
    related to the consolidation of operations and the
    reorganization of administrative functions.

Aerospace
    Segment Restructuring Activity

During the first quarter of 2006, the Company began a
    restructuring activity in its Aerospace Segment. The actions
    related to the closure of a manufacturing facility, termination
    of employees and relocation of operations. For 2006, the Company
    recorded termination benefits of $0.4 million, asset
    impairments of $0.1 million and other nominal restructuring
    costs that are included in restructuring and other impairment
    charges. Actions under this program are complete and there are
    no accrued liabilities at December 31, 2007.

    Restructuring and Divestiture Program

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company announced and
    commenced implementation of a restructuring and divestiture
    program designed to improve future operating performance and
    position the Company for future earnings growth. The actions
    have included exiting or divesting of non-core or low performing
    businesses, consolidating manufacturing operations and
    reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses to
    share services.

Certain costs associated with the 2004 restructuring and
    divestiture program are not included in restructuring and other
    impairment charges. All inventory adjustments that resulted from
    the 2004 restructuring and divestiture program and certain other
    costs related to the Company’s Aerospace Segment associated
    with closing out businesses during 2005 are included in
    materials, labor and other product costs and totaled
    $2.0 million.

Impairment
    Charges

During the fourth quarter of 2007, the following events took
    place:

•

The majority investors in two of the Company’s minority
    held investments notified the Company of plans to sell these
    companies at amounts that are below the Company’s carrying
    value. Accordingly, the Company recorded an other than temporary
    decline in value of $2.3 million related to these
    investments.

•

The Company signed a letter of intent to sell its ownership
    interest in one of its variable interest entities at a selling
    price that is below the Company’s carrying value.
    Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of
    $3.8 million, of which $2.5 million related to the
    impairment of goodwill. (See Note 7.)

•

The Company terminated certain contractual relationships in the
    Commercial Segment. As a result, intangible assets were
    determined to be impaired, resulting in a $2.5 million
    impairment charge.

•

An asset reclassified to held for sale was determined to be
    impaired and a $0.3 million impairment charge was
    recognized.

During 2006, the Company determined there was an other than
    temporary decline in value in three minority held investments
    and certain fixed assets were impaired. Accordingly, the Company
    recorded an aggregate charge of $7.4 million, which is
    included in restructuring and other impairment charges.

Goodwill adjustments relate primarily to the finalization of
    purchase price allocations.

Of the $18.9 million of goodwill impairment in 2007,
    $16.4 million is attributable to the Company’s power
    and fuel systems businesses in the Commercial segment. These
    businesses manufacture and sell auxiliary power units in the
    North American heavy truck and rail markets as well as
    components and systems for use of alternative fuels in
    industrial vehicles and passenger cars. Recent softness in
    certain of these markets negatively impacted the valuation of
    goodwill resulting in the impairment charge. The remaining
    $2.5 million goodwill impairment is related to a write-down
    to the agreed selling price of one of the Company’s
    variable interest entities in its Commercial segment.

On October 1, 2007, the Company acquired all of the
    outstanding capital stock of Arrow for approximately
    $2.1 billion. The transaction was financed with cash,
    borrowings under a new senior secured syndicated bank loan and
    proceeds received through the issuance of privately placed notes.

In connection with the acquisition, the Company entered into a
    credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
    administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication
    agent, the guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto
    and each other party thereto, (the “Senior Credit
    Facility”). The Senior Credit Facility provides for a
    five-year term loan facility of $1.4 billion and a
    five-year revolving line of credit facility of
    $400 million, both of which carry initial interest rates of
    LIBOR + 150 basis points. The Company also executed an
    interest rate swap for $600 million of the term loan from a
    floating 3 month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate to a fixed
    rate of 4.75%. The swap amortizes down to a notional value of
    $350 million at maturity in 2012. The obligations under the
    Senior Credit Facility are obligations of the Company and
    substantially all of its material wholly-owned domestic
    subsidiaries of the Company and are secured by a pledge of
    shares of certain of the Company’s domestic and foreign
    subsidiaries.

In addition, the Company (i) entered into a Note Purchase
    Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2007, among Teleflex
    Incorporated and the several purchasers party thereto (the
    “Note Purchase Agreement”) and issued
    $200 million in new senior secured notes pursuant thereto
    (the “2007 notes”), (ii) amended the terms of the
    note purchase agreement dated July 8, 2004 and the notes
    issued pursuant thereto (the “2004 Notes”) and the
    note purchase agreement dated October 25, 2002 and the
    notes issued pursuant thereto (the “2002 Notes” and,
    together with the 2004 Notes, the “amended notes”) and
    (iii) repaid $10.5 million of notes issued pursuant to
    the note agreements dated November 1, 1992 and
    December 15, 1993 (the “retired notes”).

The retired notes consisted of the 7.40% Senior Notes due
    November 15, 2007 and the 6.80% Senior Notes,
    Series B due December 15, 2008.

The 2007 notes and the amended notes, referred to collectively
    as the “senior notes”, rank pari passu in right of
    repayment with the Company’s obligations under the Senior
    Credit Facility (the “primary bank obligations”) and
    are secured and guaranteed in the same manner as the primary
    bank obligations. In connection with the foregoing, the holders
    of the senior notes have entered into a Collateral Agency and
    Intercreditor Agreement with the Company, pursuant to which
    JPMorgan Chase has been appointed as collateral agent with
    respect to the collateral pledged by the Company under the
    Senior Credit Facility and the senior note agreements. The
    senior notes have mandatory prepayment requirements upon the
    sale of certain assets and may be accelerated upon certain
    events of default, in each case, on the same basis as the
    primary bank obligations.

The interest rates payable on the amended notes were also
    modified in connection with the foregoing transactions.
    Effective October 1, 2007, (a) the 2004 Notes will
    bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at the
    following rates: (i) 7.66% in respect of the

Series 2004-1

Tranche A Senior Notes due 2011; (ii) 8.14% in respect
    of the

Series 2004-1

Tranche B Senior Notes due 2014; and (iii) 8.46% in
    respect of the

Series 2004-1

Tranche C Senior Notes due 2016; and (b) the 2002
    Notes will bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at
    the rate of 7.82% per annum. Interest rates on the amended notes
    are subject to reduction based on positive performance by the
    Company relative to financial covenants.

The Senior Credit Facility and the agreements with the holders
    of the senior notes contain covenants that, among other things,
    limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its
    subsidiaries to incur debt, create liens, consolidate, merge or
    dispose of certain assets, make certain investments, engage in
    acquisitions, pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions
    in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements.
    Under the most restrictive of these provisions, on an annual
    basis $75 million of retained earnings was available for
    dividends and stock repurchases at December 31, 2007. The
    Senior Credit Facility and the senior note agreements also
    require the Company to maintain certain consolidated leverage
    and interest coverage ratios. Currently, the Company is required
    to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (defined in the Senior
    Credit Facility as “Consolidated Leverage Ratio”) of
    not more than 4.75 to 1 and an interest coverage ratio (defined
    in the Senior Credit Facility as “Consolidated Interest
    Coverage Ratio”) of not less than 3 to 1. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with the
    terms of the Senior Credit Facility and the senior notes.

Notes payable at December 31, 2007 consists of
    $41.8 million borrowed under the revolving line of credit,
    at an average interest rate of 6.69% and $5.8 million of
    demand loans due to banks at an average interest rate of 4.76%.
    Notes payable was comprised primarily of borrowings denominated
    in Euros and British pounds. The company has approximately
    $352 million available in committed financing through the
    Senior Credit Facility.

The carrying value of year-end long-term borrowings did not
    differ materially from fair value.

The aggregate amounts of notes payable and long-term debt,
    including capital leases, maturing in the next five years are as
    follows:

    the balance sheet at fair market value and subsequent changes in
    value are recognized in the statement of income or as part of
    comprehensive income. Approximately $2.8 million of the

Shareholders’
    equity

The authorized capital of the Company is comprised of
    200 million common shares, $1 par value, and 500,000
    preference shares. No preference shares have been outstanding
    during the last three years.

On July 25, 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $140 million of
    outstanding Company common stock over twelve months ended July
    2006. In June 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors
    extended for an additional six months, until January 2007, its
    authorization for the repurchase of shares. Under the approved
    plan, the Company repurchased a total of 2,317 thousand shares
    on the open market during 2005 and 2006 for an aggregate
    purchase price of $140.0 million, and aggregate fees and
    commissions of $0.1 million.

On June 14, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of
    outstanding Company common stock. Repurchases of Company stock
    under the Board authorization may be made from time to time in
    the open market and may include privately-negotiated
    transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to
    regulatory considerations. The stock repurchase program has no
    expiration date and the Company’s ability to execute on the
    program will depend on, among other factors, cash requirements
    for acquisitions, cash generation from operations, debt
    repayment obligations, market conditions and regulatory
    requirements. In addition, under the senior loan agreements
    entered into October 1, 2007, the Company is subject to
    certain restrictions relating to its ability to repurchase
    shares in the event the Company’s consolidated leverage
    ratio exceeds certain levels, which may further limit the
    Company’s ability to repurchase shares under this Board
    authorization. Through December 31, 2007, no shares have
    been purchased under this Board authorization.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
    the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed in the same
    manner except that the weighted average number of shares is
    increased for dilutive securities. The difference between basic
    and diluted weighted average common shares results from the
    assumption that dilutive stock options were exercised. A
    reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares
    outstanding is as follows:

Stock
    compensation plans

The Company has stock-based compensation plans that provide for
    the granting of incentive and non-qualified options to officers
    and key employees to purchase shares of common stock at the
    market price of the stock on the dates options are granted. The
    terms of the 2000 Stock Compensation plan authorize the issuance
    of options to purchase up to 4,000,000 shares of common
    stock. Outstanding options generally are exercisable three to
    five years after the date of the grant and expire no more than
    ten years after the grant.

Taxes of $122.8 million on income from continuing
    operations include discrete income tax charges incurred in
    connection with funding the acquisition of Arrow International.
    Specifically, the Company (i) repatriated approximately
    $197 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries which had
    previously been deemed to be permanently reinvested in the
    respective foreign jurisdictions and (ii) changed its
    position with respect to certain previously untaxed foreign
    earnings to treat these earnings as no longer permanently
    reinvested. The change in the permanently reinvested treatment
    of the previously untaxed foreign earnings allows for future
    cash repatriations to be used to service debt. As a result of
    the change in its permanently reinvested position, the company
    recorded a tax charge of approximately $91.8 million.

At December 31, 2007, the cumulative unremitted earnings of
    other subsidiaries outside the United States, considered
    permanently reinvested, for which no income or withholding taxes
    have been provided, approximated $553.1 million. Such
    earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely and, as a
    result, no deferred tax liability has been recognized with
    regard to the remittance of such earnings. It is not practicable
    to estimate the income tax liability that might be incurred if
    such earnings were remitted to the United States.

In 2007, the Company completed the sale of two significant
    business units: 1) the precision-machined components
    business in the Aerospace segment, and 2) the automotive
    and industrial driver controls, motion systems and fluid
    handling systems business in the Commercial segment. These
    business units had income before taxes for 2007 of
    $50.5 million, which has been reported as part of
    discontinued operations, along with the related taxes on income
    of $15.5 million. The Company recorded gains on the sale of
    these business units of $299.5 million, along with the
    related taxes on the gain of $145.6 million. The gain and
    related taxes have also been reported as part of discontinued
    operations.

Under the laws of various jurisdictions in which the Company
    operates, deductions or credits that cannot be fully utilized
    for tax purposes during the current year may be carried forward,
    subject to statutory limitations, to reduce taxable income or
    taxes payable in a future tax year. At December 31, 2007,
    the tax effect of such carryforwards approximated
    $105.3 million. Of this amount, $24.9 million has no
    expiration date, $1.8 million expires after 2007 but before
    the end of 2012, and $78.6 million expires after 2012. A
    substantial amount of

F-31

TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

these carryforwards consist of tax
    losses which were acquired in an acquisition by the Company in
    2004. Therefore, the utilization of these tax attributes is
    subject to an annual limitation imposed by section 382 of
    the Internal Revenue Code. It is not expected that this annual
    limitation will prevent the Company from utilizing its
    carryforwards. The determination of state net operating loss
    carryforwards are dependent upon the
    U.S. subsidiaries’ taxable income or loss,
    apportionment percentages and other respective state laws, which
    can change from year to year and impact the amount of such
    carryforward.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of
    $68.5 million and $50.5 million at December 31,
    2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, relates
    principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain
    deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards
    in various jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was calculated
    in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109,
    which requires that a valuation allowance be established and
    maintained when it is “more likely than not” that all
    or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
    valuation allowance increase in 2007 was primarily attributable
    to the recording of deferred tax assets associated with state
    tax loss carryforwards which required a valuation allowance.

Several foreign subsidiaries continue to operate under separate
    “tax holiday” arrangements granted by certain foreign
    jurisdictions. The nature and extent of such arrangements vary
    and the benefits of such arrangements phase out in future years
    according to the specific terms and schedules as set forth by
    the particular taxing authorities having jurisdiction over the
    arrangements. The most significant arrangement, in Singapore,
    set to expire in March 2008, has been renegotiated at a rate
    still lower than that of the Singapore statutory rate. The
    revised agreement is set to expire in March 2015.

Uncertain Tax Positions:

On January 1,
    2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48, and as
    a result of that adoption, the Company recognized a charge of
    $14.2 million to retained earnings. A reconciliation of the
    beginning and ending balances for liabilities associated with
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

$

The total liabilities associated with the unrecognized tax
    benefits that, if recognized would impact the effective tax rate
    were $28.7 million and $36.2 million at January 1 2007
    and December 31, 2007 respectively. Upon the adoption of
    SFAS No. 141(R), effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008, certain unrecognized tax benefits
    that would not have an impact on the Company’s effective
    tax rate if realized (or re-measured) prior to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 141(R) would have an impact on the
    Company’s effective tax rate if realized (or re-measured)
    after the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R). Prior to the
    adoption of FAS 141(R), the adjustment to the FIN 48
    reserve is recorded as an increase to goodwill if an expense,
    and, if a benefit, is applied to reduce goodwill. Subsequent to
    the adoption of FAS 141(R) (effective for the Company with
    its year beginning January 1, 2009) the above rule
    will no longer apply and any expense or benefit associated with
    realizing (or re-measuring) the unrecognized tax benefit will be
    recorded as part of income tax expense. The Company is currently
    assessing the impact of SFAS No. 141(R) on its consolidated
    financial position and results of operations.

    consolidated Balance Sheets. The expense for interest and
    penalties reflected in income from continuing operations for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 was $3.8 million and
    $1.4 million respectively (interest is net of related tax
    benefits where applicable). The corresponding liabilities in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets for interest and penalties were
    $11.3 million and $4.9 million respectively at
    December 31, 2007 ($5.5 million and $1.7 million

The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to income
    tax examinations by various taxing authorities. As a result of
    the outcome of ongoing or future examinations, or due to the
    expiration of statutes of limitation for certain jurisdictions,
    it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax
    benefits for tax positions taken could materially change from
    those recorded as liabilities at December 31, 2007. Based
    on the status of various examinations by the relevant federal,
    state, and foreign tax authorities, the Company anticipates that
    certain examinations may be concluded within the next twelve
    months of the reporting date of the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements, the most significant of which are in
    Germany, France, and the United States. Due to the potential for
    resolution of foreign and US examinations, and the expiration of
    various statutes of limitation, it is reasonably possible that
    the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits may change within
    the next twelve months by a range of zero to $17 million.

Note 13 —

Pension and other
    postretirement benefits

The Company has a number of defined benefit pension and
    postretirement plans covering eligible U.S. and

non-U.S. employees.

The defined benefit pension plans are noncontributory. The
    benefits under these plans are based primarily on years of
    service and employees’ pay near retirement. The
    Company’s funding policy for U.S. plans is to
    contribute annually, at a minimum, amounts required by
    applicable laws and regulations. Obligations under

non-U.S. plans

are systematically provided for by depositing funds with
    trustees or by book reserves.

The parent Company and certain subsidiaries provide medical,
    dental and life insurance benefits to pensioners and survivors.
    The associated plans are unfunded and approved claims are paid
    from Company funds.

The discount rate for U.S. plans of 6.45% was established
    by comparing the projection of expected benefit payments to the
    Citigroup Pension Discount Curve (published monthly) as of
    December 31, 2007. The expected benefit payments are
    discounted by each corresponding discount rate on the yield
    curve. Once the present value of the string of benefit payments
    is established, the Company solves for the single spot rate to
    apply to all obligations of the plan that will exactly match the
    previously determined present value.

The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve is constructed beginning
    with a U.S. Treasury par curve that reflects the entire
    Treasury and Separate Trading of Registered Interest and
    Principal Securities (“STRIPS”) market. From the
    Treasury curve, Citibank produces a AA corporate par curve by
    adding option-adjusted spreads that are drawn from the AA
    corporate sector of the Citigroup Broad Investment —
    Grade Bond Index. Finally, from the AA corporate par curve,
    Citigroup derives the spot rates that constitute the Pension
    Discount Curve. For payments beyond 30 years, the Company
    extends the curve assuming that the discount rate derived in
    year 30 is extended to the end of the plan’s payment
    expectations.

Increasing the assumed healthcare trend rate by 1% would
    increase the benefit obligation by $4.0 million and would
    increase the 2007 benefit expense by $0.3 million.
    Decreasing the trend rate by 1% would decrease the benefit
    obligation by $3.5 million and would decrease the 2007
    benefit expense by $0.2 million.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. and foreign
    defined benefit pension plans was $283.1 million and
    $221.9 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit
    obligation, and fair value of plan assets for U.S. and
    foreign plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of
    plan assets were $209.4 million, $204.0 million
    $171.0 million, respectively for 2007 and
    $233.4 million, $221.9 million and
    $161.8 million, respectively for 2006.

Plan assets are allocated among various categories of equities,
    fixed income, cash and cash equivalents with professional
    investment managers whose performance is actively monitored. The
    target allocation among plan assets allows for variances based
    on economic and market trends. The primary investment objective
    is long-term growth of assets in order to meet present and
    future benefit obligations. The Company periodically conducts an
    asset/liability modeling study to ensure the investment strategy
    is aligned with the profile of benefit obligations.

Operating leases:

The Company uses various
    leased facilities and equipment in its operations. The terms for
    these leased assets vary depending on the lease agreement. In
    connection with these operating leases, the Company has residual
    value guarantees in the amount of $1.9 million at
    December 31, 2007. The Company’s future payments
    cannot exceed the minimum rent obligation plus the residual
    value guarantee amount. The guarantee amounts are tied to the
    unamortized lease values of the assets under lease, and are due
    should the Company decide neither to renew these leases, nor to
    exercise its purchase option. At December 31, 2007, the
    Company had no liabilities recorded for these obligations. Any
    residual value guarantee amounts paid to the lessor may be
    recovered by the Company from the sale of the assets to a third
    party.

Future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2007
    (including residual value guarantee amounts) under noncancelable
    operating leases are as follows:

Accounts receivable securitization program:

We
    use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain access
    to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs. As
    currently structured, we sell certain trade receivables on a
    non-recourse basis to a consolidated special purpose entity
    which in turn sells interests in those receivables to a
    commercial paper conduit. The conduit issues notes secured by
    those interests to third party investors. The assets of the
    special purpose entity are not available to satisfy our
    obligations. The total amount of accounts receivable sold to the
    special purpose entity were $124.3 million and
    $171.5 million at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, respectively. The special purpose entity
    has received cash consideration of $39.7 million and
    $40.0 million for the interests in the accounts receivable
    it has sold to the commercial paper conduit at December 31,
    2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, which amounts
    were removed from the consolidated balance sheet at such dates
    in accordance with FAS 140, “Accounting for Transfers
    and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities”.

Environmental:

The Company is subject to
    contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations
    that in the future may require the Company to take further
    action to correct the effects on the environment of

TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

prior disposal practices or releases of chemical or petroleum
    substances by the Company or other parties. Much of this
    liability results from the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”),
    often referred to as Superfund, the U.S. Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and similar
    state laws. These laws require the Company to undertake certain
    investigative and remedial activities at sites where the Company
    conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where
    Company-generated waste was disposed.

Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost
    from site to site. These activities, and their associated costs,
    depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving
    remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and
    enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of
    potentially responsible parties. At December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet included an accrued liability of $7.5 million and
    $7.4 million, respectively, relating to these matters.
    Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs and,
    under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may
    exceed the amount accrued as of December 31, 2007. The
    time-frame over which the accrued or presently unrecognized
    amounts may be paid out, based on past history, is estimated to
    be

15-20 years.

Regulatory matters:

On October 11, 2007,
    the Company’s subsidiary, Arrow International, Inc.
    (“Arrow”), received a corporate warning letter from
    the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The letter
    cites three site-specific warning letters issued by the FDA in
    2005 and subsequent inspections performed from June 2005 to
    February 2007 at Arrow’s facilities in the United States.
    The letter expresses concerns with Arrow’s quality systems,
    including complaint handling, corrective and preventive action,
    process and design validation, inspection and training
    procedures. It also advises that Arrow’s corporate-wide
    program to evaluate, correct and prevent quality system issues
    has been deficient. Limitations on pre-market approvals and
    certificates of foreign goods had previously been imposed on
    Arrow based on prior inspections and the corporate warning
    letter does not impose additional sanctions that are expected to
    have a material financial impact on the Company.

In connection with its acquisition of Arrow, completed on
    October 1, 2007, the Company has developed an integration
    plan that includes the commitment of significant resources to
    correct these previously-identified regulatory issues and
    further improve overall quality systems. Senior management
    officials from the Company have met with FDA representatives,
    and a comprehensive written corrective action plan was presented
    to FDA in late 2007. The Company has begun implementing its
    corrective action plan, which it expects to complete by the end
    of 2008.

While we believe we can remediate these issues in an expeditious
    manner, there can be no assurances regarding the length of time
    or expenditures required to resolve these issues to the
    satisfaction of the FDA. If our remedial actions are not
    satisfactory to the FDA, we may have to devote additional
    financial and human resources to our efforts, and the FDA may
    take further regulatory actions against us, including, but not
    limited to, seizing our product inventory, obtaining a court
    injunction against further marketing of our products or
    assessing civil monetary penalties.

Litigation:

The Company is a party to various
    lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business.
    These lawsuits and claims include actions involving product
    liability, intellectual property, employment, import/export, and
    environmental matters. Based on information currently available,
    advice of counsel, established reserves and other resources, the
    Company does not believe that any such actions are likely to be,
    individually or in the aggregate, material to its business,
    financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
    However, in the event of unexpected further developments, it is
    possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, or other
    similar matters, if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to
    the Company’s business, financial condition, results

of operations or liquidity. Legal costs such as outside counsel
    fees and expenses are charged to expense in the period incurred.

Other:

The Company has various purchase
    commitments for materials, supplies and items of permanent
    investment incident to the ordinary conduct of business. In the
    aggregate, such commitments are not at prices in excess of
    current market.

Business segments
    and other information

SFAS No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information,

defines an operating
    segment as a component of an enterprise (a) that engages in
    business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur
    expenses, (b) whose operating results are regularly
    reviewed by the enterprise’s chief operating decision maker
    to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment
    and to assess its performance, and (c) for which discrete
    financial information is available. Based on these criteria, the
    Company has determined that it has three reportable segments:
    Medical, Commercial and Aerospace.

The Medical Segment businesses develop, manufacture and
    distribute medical devices primarily used in critical care,
    surgical applications and cardiac care. Additionally, the
    company designs, manufactures and supplies devices and
    instruments for medical device manufacturers. Over
    80 percent of medical segment revenues are derived from
    devices that are considered disposable or single use. The
    Medical Segment’s products are largely sold and distributed
    to hospitals and healthcare providers and are most widely used
    in the acute care setting for a range of diagnostic and
    therapeutic procedures and in general and specialty surgical

During 2007, the Company sold a product line in its Medical
    segment and sold a building which it had classified as held for
    sale. The Company incurred a net loss of $1.1 million on
    these two transactions.

In connection with the Company’s 2006 restructuring program
    the Company identified certain assets that would no longer be
    used and sold them in 2006, recognizing a pre-tax loss of
    $0.7 million on the dispositions. These assets were
    primarily land and buildings.

In connection with the Company’s 2004 restructuring and
    divestiture program the Company determined that certain assets
    would no longer be used and sold them in 2005, realizing a
    pre-tax gain of $14.1 million. These assets were primarily
    a product line in the Company’s Medical segment and real
    estate.

On December 27, 2007 the Company completed the sale of its
    business units that design and manufacture automotive and
    industrial driver controls, motion systems and fluid handling
    systems to Kongsberg Automotive Holding for $560 million in
    cash and realized a pre-tax gain of $224.2 million. The
    ultimate selling price is dependent on the finalization of
    working capital balances on December 27, 2007 and various
    tax elections. The Company has recorded its best estimates for
    these matters. The business units divested, Teleflex Automotive,
    Teleflex Industrial and Teleflex Fluid Systems were all part of
    the Company’s Commercial segment.

On June 29, 2007 the Company completed the sale of Teleflex
    Aerospace Manufacturing Group (“TAMG”), a
    precision-machined components business in the Aerospace segment
    for $133.9 million in cash and realized a pre-tax gain of
    $75.2 million.

During 2006 the company sold a small medical business and
    incurred a pre-tax loss of $0.5 million. Also during 2006,
    the Company finalized the post closing adjustments related to
    the three 2005 divestitures and realized a net pre-tax gain of
    $0.7 million.

In 2005, the Company completed the sale of its automotive pedal
    systems business, sold a European medical product sterilization
    business, and completed the sale of Sermatech International, a
    surface-engineering/specialty coatings business that was
    previously reported as part of the Company’s Aerospace
    segment, and realized an aggregate pre-tax gain of
    $34.9 million from these divestitures.
