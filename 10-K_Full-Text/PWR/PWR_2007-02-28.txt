PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

General

Quanta is a leading provider of specialty contracting services,
    offering

end-to-end

network solutions to the electric power, gas,
    telecommunications, cable television and specialty services
    industries. We believe that we are the largest contractor
    serving the transmission and distribution sector of the North
    American electric utility industry. Our consolidated revenues
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately
    $2.13 billion, of which 67% was attributable to electric
    power and gas customers, 15% to telecommunications and cable
    television customers and 18% to ancillary services, such as
    inside electrical wiring, intelligent traffic networks, cable
    and control systems for light rail lines, airports and highways,
    and specialty rock trenching, directional boring and road
    milling for industrial and commercial customers. We were
    organized as a corporation in the state of Delaware in 1997 and
    since that time have made strategic acquisitions and grown
    organically to expand our geographic presence, generate
    operating synergies with existing businesses and develop new
    capabilities to meet our customers’ evolving needs.

We have established a nationwide presence with a workforce of
    over 12,000 employees, which enables us to quickly and reliably
    serve our diversified customer base. Our customers include many
    of the leading companies in the industries we serve.

Representative customers include:

• Alabama Power Company

• Lower Colorado River
    Authority

• American Electric Power

• Pacific Gas and
    Electric

• AT&T

• Puget Sound Energy

• CenterPoint Energy

• San Diego
    Gas & Electric

• Crosstex Energy

• Southern California
    Edison

• Ericsson

• United Power

• Florida
    Power & Light

• Verizon Communications

• Georgia Power Company

• Windstream
    Communications (formerly Alltel)

• Intermountain Rural
    Electric Association

• Xcel Energy

We believe our reputation for responsiveness, performance,
    geographic reach and a comprehensive service offering has also
    enabled us to develop strong strategic alliances with numerous
    customers.

Industry
    Overview

We estimate that the total amount of annual outsourced
    infrastructure spending in the three primary industries we serve
    is in excess of $30 billion. We believe that we are the
    largest specialty contractor providing services for the
    installation and maintenance of network infrastructure and that
    we and the other five largest specialty contractors providing
    these services account for less than 15% of this market.
    Smaller, typically private companies provide the balance of
    these services.

We expect the following industry trends to impact demand for our
    services in the future, although we cannot predict the timing or
    magnitude of that impact:

Need to upgrade electric power transmission and distribution
    networks.

The U.S. and Canadian electric power
    grid, which consists of more than 200,000 miles of high-voltage
    lines delivering electricity to over 300 million people, is
    aging and requires significant maintenance and expansion to
    handle the nation’s current and growing power needs. In
    addition, the grid must facilitate the sale of electricity
    across competitive regional networks, a function for which it
    was not originally designed. Meanwhile, demand for electricity
    is expected to continue to grow. The North American Electric
    Reliability Council (NERC) reports in its 2006 Long-Term
    Reliability Assessment that demand for electricity in the U.S.
    will increase by 19%, or 141,000 megawatts, from 2005 to 2015.
    Additionally, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy
    Information Administration (EIA) projects in



its 2007 Annual Energy Outlook that total U.S. electricity sales
    from producers to consumers will increase by 41% from
    3,660 billion

kilowatt-hours

in 2005 to 5,168 billion

kilowatt-hours

in 2030.

Increasing demand for electricity, coupled with the aging
    infrastructure, is expected to result in increased spending on
    transmission and distribution systems. A 2006 survey by the
    Edison Electric Institute of its members indicated that
    investor-owned electric utilities planned to spend
    $31.5 billion on transmission projects from 2006 to 2009, a
    nearly 60% increase over the previous four year period, and to
    invest an average of $14 billion per year over the next
    10 years on distribution networks. In 2006, NERC projected
    that investment in the transmission system will add
    approximately 12,800 miles of new transmission lines from 2006
    to 2015, representing a 6.1% increase in the total miles of
    installed

high-voltage

transmission lines in North America over that period, with over
    9,000 of those miles proposed for installation by the end of
    2010. We believe spending levels will continue to increase as
    utilities work to address infrastructure maintenance
    requirements as well as the future reliability standards
    required by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Energy Act).

The Energy Policy Act of 2005.

Since being
    signed into law in August 2005, several segments of the Energy
    Act have come into effect and, as a result, have better
    positioned utilities to finance and implement system
    enhancements. One of the objectives of the Energy Act is to
    improve the nation’s electric transmission capacity and
    reliability and to promote investment in the nation’s
    energy infrastructure. It calls for a self-regulating
    reliability organization that will implement and enforce
    mandatory reliability standards on all market participants, with
    oversight by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

We believe one of the most significant provisions of the Energy
    Act is the repeal of a longstanding barrier to effective
    competition — the Public Utility Holding Company Act
    of 1935 (PUHCA). We believe the repeal of PUHCA opens the
    electricity and natural gas sectors to new sources of investment
    in necessary energy infrastructure.

Additionally, FERC has issued rules to allow a more favorable
    return on equity for transmission system owners and has approved
    incentive rates to encourage transmission expansion and help
    ensure reliability in certain regions of the nation. FERC has
    also made progress in identifying corridors of national
    interest. Under this segment of the Energy Act, FERC is
    authorized to issue permits for the construction or modification
    of transmission facilities within the identified corridors. As
    these rules are finalized, we expect them to lead to a
    streamlined permitting process, which should make investment in
    the nation’s transmission system more attractive.

Increased outsourcing of network infrastructure installation
    and maintenance.

We believe that electric power,
    gas, telecommunications and cable television providers are
    increasingly focusing on their core competencies, resulting in
    an increase in the outsourcing of network services. Total
    employment in the electric utility industry declined
    dramatically in the last decade, reflecting, in part, the
    outsourcing trend by utilities. We believe that by outsourcing
    network services to third-party service providers such as us,
    our customers can reduce costs, provide flexibility in budgets
    and improve service and performance.

One of the largest issues facing utilities is the aging of the
    workforce. It is estimated that approximately 80 percent of
    the industry workforce is over 40. Many utilities look to a
    third-party partner to help address this issue. With more than
    12,000 employees across the nation, we believe we are well
    positioned to provide skilled labor to supplement or completely
    outsource a utility’s workforce. As a specialty contractor
    with nationwide scope, we are able to leverage our existing
    labor force and equipment infrastructure across multiple
    customers and projects, resulting in better utilization of labor
    and assets.

Increased capital expenditures resulting from our
    customers’ improved financial position.

The
    economic health of the industries we serve continues to improve
    after the downturn that a number of companies, including many of
    our customers, suffered in past years. As a result, we believe
    that both capital spending and maintenance budgets have
    stabilized and will increase in certain key end markets.

Increased opportunities in Fiber to the Premises, or FTTP,
    and Fiber to the Node, or FTTN.

We believe that
    several of the large telecommunications companies are increasing
    their spending, particularly for FTTP and FTTN initiatives.
    Initiatives for this

last-mile

fiber build-out have been announced by Verizon and AT&T as
    well as municipalities throughout the United States. Verizon has
    indicated that it expects to pass 18 million premises with
    its fiber network by the end of 2010. This equates to more than
    50% of the households in Verizon’s 28-state area.



In addition, AT&T has announced plans to offer Internet
    telephone service to 18 million homes by the first half of
    2008, including the installation of more than 38,000 miles
    of fiber at an estimated cost of $4 billion. At the end of
    2006, AT&T had launched its suite of services, which
    includes Internet Protocol (IP) television, high-speed Internet
    access and, eventually, voice services to 11 markets in Texas,
    California, Indiana and Connecticut.

This fiber will deliver integrated

IP-based

television, high-speed Internet and IP voice and wireless
    bundles of products and services. As a result of these efforts,
    we expect an increase in demand for our telecommunications and
    underground construction services over the next few years. While
    not all of this spending will be for services that we provide,
    we believe that we are well positioned to furnish infrastructure
    solutions for these initiatives throughout the United States.

Increased demand calls for new generation
    sources.

Using information from Energy Ventures
    Analysis, Inc.’s database of all proposed new power plants
    in the U.S., NERC has estimated that over 88,000 megawatts of
    new generation capacity is scheduled to be added from 2006 to
    2015. Furthermore, the EIA projects that a total of 258,000
    megawatts of new generating capacity is expected between 2006
    and 2030, representing a total investment of approximately
    $412 billion (in 2005 dollars), although significant
    increases in new generating capacity are not projected until
    after 2015. We believe that over the next five years there will
    be an estimated $1.5 billion to $2 billion per year
    spent by generation and transmission cooperatives to build new
    power plants. As new power plants are built, we expect an
    increase in demand for transmission and substation engineering
    and installation services.

Strengths

Geographic reach and significant size and
    scale.

As a result of our nationwide operations
    and significant scale, we are able to deploy services to
    customers across the United States. This capability is
    particularly important to our customers who operate networks
    that span multiple states or regions. The scale of our
    operations also allows us to mobilize significant numbers of
    employees on short notice for emergency restoration services.

Strong financial profile.

Our strong liquidity
    position provides us with the flexibility to capitalize on new
    business and growth opportunities. As of December 31, 2006,
    we had $383.7 million in cash and cash equivalents on our
    balance sheet and no significant amounts of debt maturing until
    October 2008.

Strong and diverse customer relationships.

Our
    customer relationships extend over multiple end markets, and
    include electric power, gas, telecommunications and cable
    television companies, as well as commercial, industrial and
    governmental entities. We have established a solid base of
    long-standing customer relationships by providing high quality
    service in a cost-efficient and timely manner. We enjoy
    multi-year relationships with many of our customers. In some
    cases, these relationships are decades old. We derive a
    significant portion of our revenues from strategic alliances or
    long-term maintenance agreements with our customers, which we
    believe offer opportunities for future growth. For example,
    certain of our strategic alliances contain an exclusivity clause
    or a right of first refusal for a certain type of work or in a
    certain geographic region.

Proprietary technology.

Our electric power
    customers benefit from our ability to perform services without
    interrupting power service to their customers, which we refer to
    as energized services. We hold a U.S. patent for the
    exclusive use through 2014 of the
    LineMaster

tm

robotic arm, which enhances our ability to deliver these
    energized services to our customers. We believe that delivery of
    energized services is a significant factor in differentiating us
    from our competition and winning new business. Our energized
    services workforce is specially trained to deliver these
    services and operate the
    LineMaster

tm

robotic arm.

Delivery of comprehensive

end-to-end

solutions.

We believe that electric power, gas,
    telecommunications and cable television companies will continue
    to seek service providers who can design, install and maintain
    their networks on a quick and reliable, yet cost effective
    basis. We are one of the few network service providers capable
    of regularly delivering

end-to-end

solutions on a nationwide basis. As companies in the electric
    power, gas, telecommunications and cable television industries
    continue to search for service providers who can effectively
    design, install and maintain their networks, we believe that our
    service, industry and geographical breadth place us in a strong
    position to meet these needs.



Experienced management team.

Our executive
    management team has an average of 33 years of experience
    within the contracting industry, and our operating unit
    executives’ average over 30 years of experience in
    their respective industries.

Strategy

The key elements of our business strategy are:

Capitalize on favorable trends in certain key end
    markets.

We believe that we are well positioned
    to capitalize on increased capital spending by customers across
    certain key end markets. Our strong and diverse customer
    relationships and geographic reach should allow us to benefit
    from investments by electric power customers in transmission and
    distribution infrastructure and by large telecommunications
    companies in FTTP and FTTN initiatives.

Leverage existing customer relationships and expand services
    to drive growth.

We believe we can improve our
    rate of growth by expanding the portfolio of services and
    solutions for our existing and potential customer base.
    Expanding our portfolio of services allows us to develop, build
    and maintain networks on both a regional and national scale and
    adapt to our customers’ changing needs. We believe that
    increasing our geographic and technological capabilities,
    together with promoting best practices and cross-selling our
    services to our customers, positions us well for the current end
    market environment.

Focus on expanding operating efficiencies.

We
    intend to continue to:

•

focus on growth in our more profitable services and on projects
    that have higher margins;

•

adjust our costs to match the level of demand for our services;

•

combine overlapping operations of certain operating units;

•

share pricing, bidding, technology, equipment and best practices
    among our operating units; and

•

develop and expand the use of management information systems.

Pursue strategic acquisitions.

We continue to
    evaluate potential acquisitions of companies with strong
    management teams and good reputations to broaden our customer
    base, expand our geographic area of operation and grow our
    portfolio of services. From 1998 through 2000, we grew
    significantly through acquisitions. We believe that attractive
    acquisition candidates still exist as a result of the highly
    fragmented nature of the industry, the inability of many
    companies to expand and modernize due to capital constraints and
    the desire of owners of acquisition candidates for liquidity. We
    also believe that our financial strength, strong equity market
    position and experienced management team will be attractive to
    acquisition candidates.

Pursue new business opportunities.

We
    continuously leverage our core expertise and pursue new business
    opportunities, including opportunities in the government and
    international arenas. We believe that we are well positioned to
    respond to requests for proposals from the U.S. government
    or the private sector for power and communications
    infrastructure projects in the United States and overseas.

Financial
    Information About Geographic Areas

We operate primarily in the United States; however, we derived
    $22.8 million, $25.7 million and $53.6 million of
    our revenues from foreign operations, the majority of which was
    earned in Canada, during the years ended December 31, 2004,
    2005 and 2006, respectively. In addition, we held property and
    equipment in the amount of $3.1 million, $4.9 million
    and $6.0 million in foreign countries as of
    December 31 in each of those respective periods.

Our business, financial condition and results of operations in
    foreign countries may be adversely impacted by monetary and
    fiscal policies, currency fluctuations, energy shortages and
    other political, social and economic development.

Customers,
    Strategic Alliances and Preferred Provider
    Relationships

Our customers include electric power, gas, telecommunications
    and cable television companies, as well as commercial,
    industrial and governmental entities. Our 10 largest customers
    accounted for 33.3% of our consolidated revenues during the year
    ended December 31, 2006. Our largest customer accounted for
    approximately 7.3% of our consolidated revenues for the year
    ended December 31, 2006.

Although we have a centralized marketing strategy, management at
    each of our operating units is responsible for developing and
    maintaining successful long-term relationships with customers.
    Our operating unit management teams build upon existing customer
    relationships to secure additional projects and increase revenue
    from our current customer base. Many of these customer
    relationships originated decades ago and are maintained through
    a partnering approach to account management which includes
    project evaluation and consulting, quality performance,
    performance measurement and direct customer contact. On an
    operating unit level, management maintains a parallel focus on
    pursuing growth opportunities with prospective customers. We
    continue to encourage operating unit management to cross-sell
    services of other operating units to their customers. In
    addition, our business development group promotes and markets
    our services for prospective large national accounts and
    projects that would require services from multiple operating
    units.

We strive to maintain our status as a preferred vendor to our
    customers. Many of our customers and prospective customers
    maintain a list of preferred vendors with whom the customer
    enters into a formal contractual agreement as a result of a

request-for-proposal

process. As a preferred vendor, we have met minimum standards
    for a specific category of service, maintain a high level of
    performance and agree to certain payment terms and negotiated
    rates.

We believe that our strategic relationships with large providers
    of electric power and telecommunications services will offer
    opportunities for future growth. Many of these strategic
    relationships take the form of a strategic alliance or long-term
    maintenance agreement. Strategic alliance agreements generally
    state an intention to work together and many provide us with
    preferential bidding procedures. Strategic alliances and
    long-term maintenance agreements are typically agreements for an
    initial term of approximately two to four years that may include
    an option to add extensions at the end of the initial term.
    Certain of our strategic alliance and long-term maintenance
    agreements are “evergreen” contracts with exclusivity
    clauses providing that we will be awarded all contracts, or a
    right of first refusal, for a certain type of work or in a
    certain geographic region. None of these contracts, however,
    guarantees a specific dollar amount of work to be performed by
    us.

Backlog

Backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to
    realize from work to be performed over the next twelve months on
    uncompleted contracts, including new contractual agreements on
    which work has not begun. Our backlog at December 31, 2005
    and 2006 was approximately $1.30 billion and
    $1.48 billion. In many instances, our customers are not
    contractually committed to specific volumes of services under
    our long-term maintenance contracts and many of our contracts
    may be terminated with notice. There can be no assurance as to
    our customer’s requirements or that our estimates are
    accurate.



Competition

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We
    compete with other contractors in most of the geographic markets
    in which we operate, and several of our competitors are large
    domestic companies that may have greater financial, technical
    and marketing resources than we do. In addition, there are
    relatively few barriers to entry into some of the industries in
    which we operate and, as a result, any organization that has
    adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise
    may become a competitor. A significant portion of our revenues
    is currently derived from unit price or fixed price agreements,
    and price is often an important factor in the award of such
    agreements. Accordingly, we could be underbid by our competitors
    in an effort by them to procure such business. We believe that
    as demand for our services increases, customers will
    increasingly consider other factors in choosing a service
    provider, including technical expertise and experience,
    financial and operational resources, nationwide presence,
    industry reputation and dependability, which we expect to
    benefit contractors such as us. There can be no assurance,
    however, that our competitors will not develop the expertise,
    experience and resources to provide services that are superior
    in both price and quality to our services, or that we will be
    able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. We may
    also face competition from the in-house service organizations of
    our existing or prospective customers, including electric power,
    gas, telecommunications and cable television companies, which
    employ personnel who perform some of the same types of services
    as those provided by us. Although a significant portion of these
    services is currently outsourced by our customers, there can be
    no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will
    continue to outsource services in the future.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we had 1,401 salaried employees,
    including executive officers, project managers and engineers,
    job superintendents, staff and clerical personnel, and
    10,620 hourly employees, the number of which fluctuates
    depending upon the number and size of the projects we undertake
    at any particular time. Approximately 50% of our employees at
    December 31, 2006 were covered by collective bargaining
    agreements, primarily with the International Brotherhood of
    Electrical Workers (IBEW). Under these collective bargaining
    agreements, we agree to pay specified wages to our union
    employees, observe certain workplace rules and make employee
    benefit payments to multi-employer pension plans and employee
    benefit trusts rather than administering the funds on behalf of
    these employees. These collective bargaining agreements have
    varying terms and expiration dates. The majority of the
    collective bargaining agreements contain provisions that
    prohibit work stoppages or strikes, even during specified
    negotiation periods relating to agreement renewal, and provide
    for binding arbitration dispute resolution in the event of
    prolonged disagreement.

We provide a health, welfare and benefit plan for employees who
    are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have a
    401(k) plan pursuant to which eligible employees who are not
    provided retirement benefits through a collective bargaining
    agreement may make contributions through a payroll deduction. We
    make matching cash contributions of 100% of each employee’s
    contribution up to 3% of that employee’s salary and 50% of
    each employee’s contribution between 3% and 6% of such
    employee’s salary, up to the maximum amount permitted by
    law.

Our industry is experiencing a shortage of journeyman linemen in
    certain geographic areas. In response to the shortage, we seek
    to take advantage of various IBEW and National Electrical
    Contractors Association (NECA) training programs and support the
    joint IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program which trains qualified
    electrical workers.

We believe our relationships with our employees and union
    representatives are good.

Materials

Our customers typically supply most or all of the materials
    required for each job. However, for some of our contracts, we
    may procure all or part of the materials required. We purchase
    such materials from a variety of sources and do not anticipate
    experiencing any difficulties in procuring such materials.



Training,
    Quality Assurance and Safety

Performance of our services requires the use of equipment and
    exposure to conditions that can be dangerous. Although we are
    committed to a policy of operating safely and prudently, we have
    been and will continue to be subject to claims by employees,
    customers and third parties for property damage and personal
    injuries resulting from performance of our services. Our
    policies require that employees complete the prescribed training
    and service program of the operating unit for which they work in
    addition to those required, if applicable, by the IBEW/NECA
    Apprenticeship Program prior to performing more sophisticated
    and technical jobs. For example, all journeyman linemen are
    required by the IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program to complete a
    minimum of 7,000 hours of

on-the-job

training, approximately 200 hours of classroom education
    and extensive testing and certification. Certain of our
    operating units have established apprenticeship training
    programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor that
    prescribe training requirements for employees who are not
    otherwise subject to the requirements of the IBEW/NECA
    Apprenticeship Program. Also, each operating unit requires
    additional training, depending upon the sophistication and
    technical requirements of each particular job. We have
    established company-wide training and educational programs, as
    well as comprehensive safety policies and regulations, by
    sharing best practices throughout our operations.

Regulation

Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local
    laws and regulations including:

•

licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to
    electricians and engineers;

•

building and electrical codes;

•

permitting and inspection requirements applicable to
    construction projects;

•

regulations relating to worker safety and environmental
    protection; and

•

special bidding, procurement and other requirements on
    government projects.

We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our
    operations and that we are in substantial compliance with
    applicable regulatory requirements. Our failure to comply with
    applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or
    revocation of our operating licenses.

Environmental
    Matters

We are committed to the protection of the environment and train
    our employees to perform their duties accordingly. We are
    subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws
    and regulations governing our operations, including the
    handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and
    hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and
    discharges into the environment, including discharges to air,
    surface water and groundwater and soil. We also are subject to
    laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup
    responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the
    environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, such
    liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of previously owned or
    operated properties, or properties to which hazardous substances
    or wastes were sent by current or former operations at our
    facilities, regardless of whether we directly caused the
    contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or
    disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or
    wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely
    affect our ability to sell, lease or use our properties as
    collateral for financing. In addition, we could be held liable
    for significant penalties and damages under certain
    environmental laws and regulations and also could be subject to
    a revocation of our licenses or permits, which could materially
    and adversely affect our business and results of operations.

From time to time, we may incur costs and obligations for
    correcting environmental noncompliance matters and for
    remediation at or relating to certain of our properties. We
    believe we have complied with, and are currently complying with
    our environmental obligations to date and that such obligations
    will not have a material adverse effect on our business or
    financial performance.



Risk
    Management and Insurance

The primary risks in our operations are bodily injury and
    property damage. We are insured for employer’s liability
    and general liability claims, subject to a deductible of
    $1.0 million per occurrence and for auto liability and
    workers’ compensation claims subject to a deductible of
    $2.0 million per occurrence. In addition, beginning
    August 1, 2006, we have been subject to an additional
    cumulative aggregate liability of up to $2.0 million on
    workers’ compensation claims in excess of $2.0 million
    per occurrence per policy year. We also have an employee health
    care benefit plan for employees not subject to collective
    bargaining agreements, which is subject to a deductible of
    $250,000 per claimant per year. Losses up to the deductible
    amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate
    liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred
    but not reported, with assistance from a third-party actuary.
    The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends,
    and management believes such accruals to be adequate. However,
    insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due
    to the many relevant factors, the effects of which are often
    unknown, including the severity of an injury, the determination
    of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of
    incidents not yet reported and the effectiveness of our safety
    program.

Our casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods from
    August 1, 2000 to February 28, 2003 is experiencing
    financial distress, but is currently paying valid claims. In the
    event that this insurer’s financial situation further
    deteriorates, we may be required to pay certain obligations that
    otherwise would have been paid by this insurer. We estimate that
    the total future claim amount that this insurer is currently
    obligated to pay on our behalf for the above mentioned policy
    periods is approximately $6.2 million; however, our
    estimate of the potential range of these future claim amounts is
    between $3.6 million and $8.5 million. The actual
    amounts ultimately paid by us related to these claims, if any,
    may vary materially from the above range and could be impacted
    by further claims development and the extent to which the
    insurer could not honor its obligations. We continue to monitor
    the financial situation of this insurer and analyze any
    alternative actions that could be pursued. In any event, we do
    not expect any failure by this insurer to honor its obligations
    to us, or any alternative actions we may pursue, to have a
    material adverse impact on our financial condition; however, the
    impact could be material to our results of operations or cash
    flow in a given period.

Seasonality

Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to
    seasonal variations. These variations are influenced by weather,
    customer spending patterns, bidding seasons and holidays.
    Typically, our revenues are lowest in the first quarter of the
    year because cold, snowy or wet conditions cause delays. The
    second quarter is typically better than the first, as some
    projects begin, but continued cold and wet weather can often
    impact second quarter productivity. The third quarter is
    typically the best of the year, as a greater number of projects
    are underway and weather is more accommodating to work on
    projects. Revenues during the fourth quarter of the year are
    typically lower than the third quarter but higher than the
    second quarter. Many projects are completed in the fourth
    quarter and revenues often are impacted positively by customers
    seeking to spend their capital budget before the end of the
    year; however, the holiday season and inclement weather
    sometimes can cause delays and thereby reduce revenues.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties,
    including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties
    described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are
    not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not known to us or not described below also may
    impair our business operations. If any of the following risks
    actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of
    operations could be harmed and we may not be able to achieve our
    goals. This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

also includes statements reflecting assumptions, expectations,
    projections, intentions, or beliefs about future events that are
    intended as “forward-looking statements” under the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be
    read in conjunction with the section entitled

“Uncertainty of Forward-Looking Statements and
    Information,”

included in Item 7
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.”

Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to
    quarter.

We typically experience lower gross and
    operating margins during winter months due to lower demand for
    our services and more difficult operating conditions.
    Additionally, our quarterly results also may be materially and
    adversely affected by:

•

the timing and volume of work under contract;

•

regional or general economic conditions;

•

the budgetary spending patterns of customers;

•

variations in the margins of projects performed during any
    particular quarter;

•

a change in the demand for our services caused by severe weather
    conditions;

•

increases in construction and design costs;

•

the termination of existing agreements;

•

losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by
    insurance;

•

a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;

•

payment risk associated with the financial condition of our
    customers;

•

changes in bonding and lien requirements applicable to existing
    and new agreements;

•

costs we incur to support growth internally or through
    acquisitions or otherwise;

•

the timing and integration of acquisitions; and

•

the timing and magnitude of acquisition integration costs and
    potential goodwill impairments.

Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may
    not be indicative of the results that you can expect for any
    other quarter or for the entire year.

An economic downturn may lead to less demand for our
    services.

Because the vast majority of our
    revenue is derived from a few industries, a downturn in any of
    those industries would adversely affect our results of
    operations. The telecommunications and utility markets
    experienced substantial change during 2002 and 2003 as evidenced
    by an increased number of bankruptcies in the telecommunications
    market, continued devaluation of many of our customers’
    debt and equity securities and pricing pressures resulting from
    challenges faced by major industry participants. These factors
    contributed to the delay and cancellation of projects and
    reduction of capital spending, which impacted our operations and
    our ability to grow at historical levels. A number of other
    factors, including financing conditions and potential
    bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect
    our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital
    expenditures in the future or pay for past services. In
    addition,



consolidation, competition or capital constraints in the
    electric power, gas, telecommunications or cable television
    industries may result in reduced spending by, or the loss of,
    one or more of our customers.

Our industry is highly competitive.

Our
    industry is served by numerous small, owner-operated private
    companies, a few public companies and several large regional
    companies. In addition, relatively few barriers prevent entry
    into some of our industries. As a result, any organization that
    has adequate financial resources and access to technical
    expertise may become one of our competitors. Competition in the
    industry depends on a number of factors, including price.
    Certain of our competitors may have lower overhead cost
    structures and, therefore, may be able to provide their services
    at lower rates than we are able to provide. In addition, some of
    our competitors may have greater resources than we do. We cannot
    be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise,
    experience and resources to provide services that are superior
    in both price and quality to our services. Similarly, we cannot
    be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our
    competitive position within our industry or maintain our
    customer base at current levels. We also may face competition
    from the in-house service organizations of our existing or
    prospective customers. Electric power, gas, telecommunications
    and cable television service providers usually employ personnel
    who perform some of the same types of services we do. We cannot
    be certain that our existing or prospective customers will
    continue to outsource services in the future.

We may be unsuccessful at generating internal
    growth.

Our ability to generate internal growth
    will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to:

•

expand the range of services we offer to customers to address
    their evolving network needs;

•

attract new customers;

•

increase the number of projects performed for existing customers;

•

hire and retain qualified employees; and

•

open additional facilities.

In addition, our customers may reduce the number or size of
    projects available to us due to their inability to obtain
    capital or pay for services provided. Many of the factors
    affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond
    our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will
    be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow
    sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal
    growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve
    internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 may fail to result in increased
    spending on the electric power transmission
    infrastructure.

Implementation of the Energy
    Policy Act of 2005 is still subject to considerable fiscal and
    regulatory uncertainty. Many of the regulations implementing the
    components of the Act have not been promulgated and many others
    have only recently been finalized, and the effect of these
    regulations, once implemented, is uncertain. As a result, the
    legislation may not result in increased spending on the electric
    power transmission infrastructure.

Factors beyond our control may affect our ability to
    successfully execute our acquisition strategy, which may have an
    adverse impact on our growth strategy.

Our
    business strategy includes expanding our presence in the
    industries we serve through strategic acquisitions of companies
    that complement or enhance our business. We expect to face
    competition for acquisition opportunities, and some of our
    competitors may have greater financial resources or access to
    financing on more favorable terms than us. This competition may
    limit our acquisition opportunities and our ability to grow
    through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions
    and make them less accretive or possibly non-accretive to us.
    Acquisitions that we may pursue may also involve significant
    cash expenditures, debt incurrence or the issuance of
    securities. Any acquisition may ultimately have a negative
    impact on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Our financial results are based upon estimates and
    assumptions that may differ from actual
    results.

In preparing our consolidated financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States, several estimates and assumptions
    are used by management in determining the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses recognized during
    the periods presented and disclosures of contingent assets and
    liabilities known to exist as of the date of the financial
    statements. These estimates and assumptions must



be made because certain information that is used in the
    preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future
    events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision
    from data available or is not capable of being readily
    calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In some
    cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine
    and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates are
    primarily used in our assessment of the allowance for doubtful
    accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of property and
    equipment, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill and
    long-lived asset impairments, self-insured claims liabilities,
    forfeiture estimates relating to stock-based compensation,
    revenue recognition under

percentage-of-completion

accounting and provision for income taxes. Actual results for
    all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and
    assumptions that we use, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
    cash flows.

Our use of

percentage-of-completion

accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of
    previously reported profits.

As discussed in
    Item 7

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Critical Accounting Policies”

and in the notes to our
    consolidated financial statements included in Item 8
    hereof, a significant portion of our revenues is recognized on a

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting, using the

cost-to-cost

method. This method is used because management considers
    expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on
    these contracts. This accounting method is standard for
    fixed-price contracts. The

percentage-of-completion

accounting practice we use results in our recognizing contract
    revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in
    proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or
    losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates
    of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses
    are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit
    estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract
    profitability. Further, a substantial portion of our contracts
    contain various cost and performance incentives. Penalties are
    recorded when known or finalized, which generally is during the
    latter stages of the contract. In addition, we record cost
    recovery claims when we believe recovery is probable and the
    amounts can be reasonably estimated. Actual collection of claims
    could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a
    reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In
    certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments
    could be significant.

Our dependence upon fixed price contracts could adversely
    affect our business.

We currently generate, and
    expect to continue to generate, a portion of our revenues under
    fixed price contracts. We must estimate the costs of completing
    a particular project to bid for fixed price contracts. The
    actual cost of labor and materials, however, may vary from the
    costs we originally estimated. These variations, along with
    other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts, may
    cause actual revenue and gross profits for a project to differ
    from those we originally estimated and could result in reduced
    profitability or losses on projects. Depending upon the size of
    a particular project, variations from the estimated contract
    costs could have a significant impact on our operating results
    for any fiscal quarter or year.

We are self-insured against potential
    liabilities.

Although we maintain insurance
    policies with respect to automobile, general liability,
    workers’ compensation and employers’ liability, those
    policies are subject to deductibles of $1.0 million to
    $2.0 million per occurrence, and we are primarily
    self-insured for all claims that do not exceed the amount of the
    applicable deductible. In addition, beginning August 1,
    2006, we have been subject to an additional cumulative aggregate
    liability of up to $2.0 million on workers’
    compensation claims in excess of $2.0 million per
    occurrence per policy year. We also have an employee health care
    benefit plan for employees not subject to collective bargaining
    agreements, which is subject to a deductible of
    $250,000 per claimant per year. Losses up to the deductible
    amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate
    liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred
    but not yet reported, with assistance from a third-party
    actuary. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to assess
    and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of
    an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to
    other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the
    effectiveness of our safety program. If we were to experience
    insurance claims or costs significantly above our estimates, our
    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected
    in a given period.

Our casualty insurance carrier for prior periods is
    experiencing financial distress, which may require us to make
    payments for losses that otherwise would be
    insured.

Our casualty insurance carrier for the
    policy periods from August 1, 2000 to February 28,
    2003 is experiencing financial distress, but is currently paying
    valid claims. In the event that this insurer’s financial
    situation deteriorates, we may be required to pay certain
    obligations that



otherwise would have been paid by this insurer. We estimate that
    the total future claim amount that this insurer is currently
    obligated to pay on our behalf for the above mentioned policy
    periods is approximately $6.2 million; however, our
    estimate of the potential range of these future claim amounts is
    between $3.6 million and $8.5 million. The actual
    amounts ultimately paid by us related to these claims, if any,
    may vary materially from the above range and could be impacted
    by further claims development and the extent to which the
    insurer can not honor its obligations. In any event, we do not
    expect any failure by this insurer to honor its obligations to
    us to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition;
    however, the impact could be material to our results of
    operations or cash flow in a given period.

We may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impact
    relating to occupational health and safety
    matters.

Our operations are subject to extensive
    laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe
    conditions in the workplace. While we have invested, and will
    continue to invest, substantial resources in our occupational
    health and safety programs, our industry involves a high degree
    of operational risk and there can be no assurance that we will
    avoid significant liability exposure. Although we have taken
    what we believe are appropriate precautions, we have suffered
    fatalities in the past and may suffer additional fatalities in
    the future. Claims for damages to persons, including claims for
    bodily injury or loss of life, could result in substantial costs
    and liabilities. In addition, if our safety record were to
    substantially deteriorate over time, our customers could cancel
    our contracts and not award us future business.

Our results of operations could be adversely affected as a
    result of goodwill impairments.

When we acquire a
    business, we record an asset called “goodwill” equal
    to the excess amount we pay for the business, including
    liabilities assumed, over the fair value of the tangible and
    intangible assets of the business we acquire. Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 provides that
    goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful
    lives not be amortized, but instead be tested at least annually
    for impairment, and intangible assets that have finite useful
    lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives.
    SFAS No. 142 provides specific guidance for testing
    goodwill and other

non-amortized

intangible assets for impairment. SFAS No. 142
    requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions
    when allocating goodwill to reporting units and determining the
    fair value of reporting unit net assets and liabilities,
    including, among other things, an assessment of market
    conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, cost of
    capital and growth rates, which could significantly impact the
    reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair
    value is determined using a combination of the discounted cash
    flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation
    approaches. Absent any impairment indicators, we perform our
    impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter. As part of
    our 2006 annual test for goodwill impairment, goodwill in the
    amount of $56.8 million was written off as a non-cash
    operating expense associated with a decrease in the expected
    future demand for the services of one of our businesses, which
    has historically served the cable television industry. Any
    future impairments would negatively impact our results of
    operations for the period in which the impairment is recognized.

We may be unsuccessful at integrating companies that either
    we have acquired or that we may acquire in the
    future.

We cannot be sure that we will
    successfully integrate our acquired companies with our existing
    operations without substantial costs, delays or other
    operational or financial problems. If we do not implement proper
    overall business controls, our decentralized operating strategy
    could result in inconsistent operating and financial practices
    at the companies we acquire and our overall profitability could
    be adversely affected. Integrating our acquired companies
    involves a number of special risks which could have a negative
    impact on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations, including:

•

failure of acquired companies to achieve the results we expect;

•

diversion of our management’s attention from operational
    and other matters;

•

difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of
    acquired companies;

•

inability to retain key personnel of acquired companies;

•

risks associated with unanticipated events or
    liabilities; and

•

potential disruptions of our business.



If one of our acquired companies suffers customer
    dissatisfaction or performance problems, the reputation of our
    entire company could suffer.

We extend credit to customers for purchases of our services,
    and in the past we have had, and in the future we may have,
    difficulty collecting receivables from major customers that have
    filed bankruptcy or are otherwise experiencing financial
    difficulties.

We grant credit, generally without
    collateral, to our customers, which include electric power and
    gas companies, telecommunications and cable television system
    operators, governmental entities, general contractors, and
    builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial
    properties located primarily in the United States. Consequently,
    we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in
    business and economic factors throughout the United States. In
    the past, our customers in the telecommunications business have
    experienced significant financial difficulties and in several
    instances have filed for bankruptcy. A number of our utility
    customers are also experiencing business challenges in the
    current business climate. If additional major customers file for
    bankruptcy or continue to experience financial difficulties, or
    if anticipated recoveries relating to receivables in existing
    bankruptcies or other workout situations fail to materialize, we
    could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of
    current allowances provided. In addition, material changes in
    any of our customer’s revenues or cash flows could affect
    our ability to collect amounts due from them.

The industries we serve are subject to rapid technological
    and structural changes that could reduce the demand for the
    services we provide.

The electric power, gas,
    telecommunications and cable television industries are
    undergoing rapid change as a result of technological advances
    that could, in certain cases, reduce the demand for our services
    or otherwise negatively impact our business. New or developing
    technologies could displace the wireline systems used for voice,
    video and data transmissions, and improvements in existing
    technology may allow telecommunications and cable television
    companies to significantly improve their networks without
    physically upgrading them.

A portion of our business depends on our ability to provide
    surety bonds. We may be unable to compete for or work on certain
    projects if we are not able to obtain the necessary surety
    bonds.

Surety market conditions currently are
    difficult as a result of significant losses incurred by many
    sureties in recent periods, both in the construction industry as
    well as in certain larger corporate bankruptcies. We have
    granted security interests in various of our assets to
    collateralize our obligations to the surety. Further, under
    standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue
    bonds on a

project-by-project

basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the
    posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or
    renewing any bonds.

Current or future market conditions, as well as changes in our
    surety’s assessment of our operating and financial risk,
    could cause our surety providers to decline to issue or renew,
    or substantially reduce the amount of, bonds for our work and
    could increase our bonding costs. These actions could be taken
    on short notice. If our surety providers were to limit or
    eliminate our access to bonding, our alternatives would include
    seeking bonding capacity from other sureties, finding more
    business that does not require bonds and posting other forms of
    collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit or
    cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely
    manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Accordingly, if we were
    to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability
    of bonding capacity, we may be unable to compete for or work on
    certain projects.

Many of our contracts may be canceled on short notice, and we
    may be unsuccessful in replacing our contracts if they are
    canceled or as they are completed or expire.

We
    could experience a decrease in our revenue, net income and
    liquidity if any of the following occur:

•

our customers cancel a significant number of contracts;

•

we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts
    upon re-bid;

•

we complete a significant number of non-recurring projects and
    cannot replace them with similar projects; or

•

we fail to reduce operating and overhead expenses consistent
    with any decrease in our revenue.

Many of our customers may cancel our contracts on short notice,
    typically

30-90 days,

even if we are not in default under the contract. Certain of our
    customers assign work to us on a

project-by-project

basis under master service agreements. Under these agreements,
    our customers often have no obligation to assign a specific
    amount of work to us. Our operations could decline significantly
    if the anticipated volume of work is not assigned to us. Many



of our contracts, including our master service agreements, are
    opened to public bid at the expiration of their terms. There can
    be no assurance that we will be the successful bidder on our
    existing contracts that come up for re-bid.

The departure of key personnel could disrupt our
    business.

We depend on the continued efforts of
    our executive officers and on senior management of our operating
    units, including the businesses we acquire. Although we have
    entered into employment agreements with terms of one to three
    years with most of our executive officers and certain other key
    employees, we cannot be certain that any individual will
    continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The
    loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain
    qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to
    manage our business. We do not carry key-person life insurance
    on any of our employees.

Our unionized workforce could adversely affect our operations
    and our ability to complete future
    acquisitions.

As of December 31, 2006,
    approximately 50% of our employees were covered by collective
    bargaining agreements. Although the majority of these agreements
    prohibit strikes and work stoppages, we cannot be certain that
    strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future. Strikes
    or work stoppages would adversely impact our relationships with
    our customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease
    our revenue. In addition, our ability to complete future
    acquisitions could be adversely affected because of our union
    status for a variety of reasons. For instance, our union
    agreements may be incompatible with the union agreements of a
    business we want to acquire and some businesses may not want to
    become affiliated with a union based company.

Our business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to
    attract and retain qualified employees.

Our
    ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will be
    limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled
    personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We cannot be
    certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled
    labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our
    growth strategy. For instance, we may experience shortages of
    qualified journeyman linemen. In addition, we cannot be certain
    that our labor expenses will not increase as a result of a
    shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel. Labor
    shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to
    maintain our business or grow our revenues.

Our business growth could outpace the capability of our
    corporate management infrastructure.

We cannot be
    certain that our infrastructure will be adequate to support our
    operations as they expand. Future growth also could impose
    significant additional responsibilities on members of our senior
    management, including the need to recruit and integrate new
    senior level managers and executives. We cannot be certain that
    we will be able to recruit and retain such additional managers
    and executives. To the extent that we are unable to manage our
    growth effectively, or are unable to attract and retain
    additional qualified management, we may not be able to expand
    our operations or execute our business plan.

Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in
    significant liabilities.

Our operations are
    subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including
    those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products,
    PCBs, fuel storage and air quality. We perform work in many
    different types of underground environments. If the field
    location maps supplied to us are not accurate, or if objects are
    present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location
    maps, our underground work could strike objects in the soil,
    some of which may contain pollutants. In such cases, these
    objects may rupture, resulting in the discharge of pollutants.
    In such circumstances, we may be liable for fines and damages,
    and we may be unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties
    providing the incorrect information. In addition, we perform
    directional drilling operations below certain environmentally
    sensitive terrains and water bodies. Due to the inconsistent
    nature of the terrain and water bodies, it is possible that such
    directional drilling may cause a surface fracture, resulting in
    the release of subsurface materials. These subsurface materials
    may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law,
    potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines. We also
    own and lease several facilities at which we store our
    equipment. Some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks
    which are above or below ground. If these tanks were to leak, we
    could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as
    potential fines.

In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of
    existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously
    unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new

clean-up

requirements could require us to incur significant costs or
    become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could
    harm our financial condition and results of operations. In
    certain instances, we have obtained indemnification or covenants
    from third parties (including predecessors or lessors) for such
    cleanup and other obligations and liabilities that we believe
    are



adequate to cover such obligations and liabilities. However,
    such third-party indemnities or covenants may not cover all of
    our costs, and such unanticipated obligations or liabilities, or
    future obligations and liabilities, may have a material adverse
    effect on our business operations or financial condition.
    Further, we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify
    or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities
    relating to any acquired business.

Risks associated with operating in international markets
    could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our
    business and prospects.

While only a small
    percentage of our revenue is currently derived from
    international markets, we hope to continue to expand the volume
    of services that we provide internationally. We presently
    conduct our international sales efforts in Canada, Mexico and
    selected countries overseas, but expect that the number of
    countries that we operate in could expand significantly over the
    next few years. Economic conditions, including those resulting
    from wars, civil unrest, acts of terrorism and other conflicts
    may adversely affect the global economy, our customers and their
    ability to pay for our services. In addition, there are numerous
    risks inherent in conducting our business internationally,
    including, but not limited to, potential instability in
    international markets, changes in regulatory requirements,
    currency fluctuations in foreign countries, and complex U.S. and
    foreign laws and treaties, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act. These risks could restrict our ability to provide
    services to international customers and could adversely affect
    our ability to operate our business profitably.

Opportunities within the government arena could lead to
    increased governmental regulation applicable to us and
    unrecoverable start up costs.

Most government
    contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding
    process. As we pursue increased opportunities in the government
    arena, management’s focus associated with the start up and
    bidding process may be diverted away from other opportunities.
    If we were to be successful in being awarded government
    contracts, a significant amount of costs could be required
    before any revenues were realized from these contracts. In
    addition, as a government contractor, we would be subject to a
    number of procurement rules and other public sector liabilities,
    any deemed violation of which could lead to fines or penalties
    or a loss of business. Government agencies routinely audit and
    investigate government contractors. Government agencies may
    review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, cost
    structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and
    standards. If government agencies determine through these audits
    or reviews that costs were improperly allocated to specific
    contracts, they will not reimburse the contractor for those
    costs or may require the contractor to refund previously
    reimbursed costs. If government agencies determine that we
    engaged in improper activity, we may be subject to civil and
    criminal penalties. In addition, if the government were to even
    allege improper activity, we also could experience serious harm
    to our reputation. Many government contracts must be
    appropriated each year. If appropriations are not made in
    subsequent years we would not realize all of the potential
    revenues from any awarded contracts.

We may not be successful in continuing to meet the
    requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
    2002.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has
    introduced many requirements applicable to us regarding
    corporate governance and financial reporting, including the
    requirements for management to report on our internal controls
    over financial reporting and for our independent registered
    public accounting firm to attest to this report. During 2006, we
    continued actions to ensure our ability to comply with these
    requirements. As of December 31, 2006, our internal control
    over financial reporting was effective; however, there can be no
    assurance that our internal control over financial reporting
    will be effective in future years. Failure to maintain effective
    internal controls could result in a decrease in the market value
    of our common stock and our other publicly traded securities,
    the reduced ability to obtain financing, the loss of customers,
    penalties and additional expenditures to meet the requirements.

We may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to
    finance desired growth.

If we cannot secure
    additional financing in the future on acceptable terms, we may
    be unable to support our growth strategy. We cannot readily
    predict the ability of certain customers to pay for past
    services or the timing, size and success of our acquisition
    efforts. Using cash for acquisitions limits our financial
    flexibility and makes us more likely to seek additional capital
    through future debt or equity financings. Our existing debt
    agreements contain significant restrictions on our operational
    and financial flexibility, including our ability to incur
    additional debt or conduct equity financings, and if we seek
    more debt we may have to agree to additional covenants that
    limit our operational and financial flexibility. When we seek
    additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that
    additional debt or equity will be available to us on terms
    acceptable to us or at all.



Our 4.5% convertible subordinated notes are presently
    convertible.

As a result of our common stock
    satisfying the market price condition of the convertible
    subordinated notes during the fourth quarter of 2006, the notes
    are presently convertible at the option of each holder during
    the first quarter of 2007. We have the right to deliver shares
    of our common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of
    our common stock upon a conversion of the notes. The notes may
    be convertible during future fiscal quarters upon the
    satisfaction of the market price condition or other conditions
    in future periods. The number of shares issuable upon a
    conversion of the notes will be determined based on a conversion
    rate of approximately $11.14 per share. In the event that
    all notes were converted for common stock, we would issue an
    aggregate of 24.2 million shares of our common stock. The
    conversion of some or all of our 4.5% convertible
    subordinated notes into our common stock could cause substantial
    dilution to existing stockholders. Any sales in the public
    market of the common stock issued upon such conversion could
    adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.
    In addition, the possibility that the notes may be converted may
    encourage short selling by market participants because the
    conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common
    stock.

If we elect to satisfy the conversion obligation in cash, the
    amount of cash payable upon conversion of the notes will be
    determined by the product of (i) the number of shares
    issuable for the principal amount of the converted notes at a
    conversion rate of approximately $11.14 per share and
    (ii) the average closing price of our common stock during a

20-day

trading period following the holders unretracted election to
    convert the notes. To the extent that the average closing price
    of our common stock during this period exceeds $11.14 per
    share, we will be required to pay cash in excess of the
    principal amount of the notes being converted, which would
    result in the recording of a loss on early extinguishment of
    debt.

Certain provisions of our corporate governing documents could
    make an acquisition of our company more
    difficult.

The following provisions of our
    certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as currently in effect,
    as well as our stockholder rights plan and Delaware law, could
    discourage potential proposals to acquire us, delay or prevent a
    change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be
    willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock:

•

our certificate of incorporation permits our Board of Directors
    to issue “blank check” preferred stock and to adopt
    amendments to our bylaws;

•

our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of
    stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be
    considered at stockholder meetings;

•

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right
    of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to
    act by written consent;

•

we are subject to provisions of Delaware law which prohibit us
    from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions
    with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three
    years following the date such stockholder became classified as
    an interested stockholder; and

•

we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that could cause
    substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
    acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors or
    permitted by the stockholder rights plan.

Properties

Facilities

We lease our corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas and
    maintain offices nationwide. This space is used for offices,
    equipment yards, warehouses, storage and vehicle shops. As of
    December 31, 2006, we own 16 of the facilities we occupy,
    all of which are encumbered by our credit facility, and we lease
    the remainder. We believe that our existing facilities are
    sufficient for our current needs.



Equipment

We operate a nationwide fleet of owned and leased trucks and
    trailers, support vehicles and specialty construction equipment,
    such as backhoes, excavators, trenchers, generators, boring
    machines, cranes, wire pullers and tensioners, all of which are
    encumbered by our credit facility. As of December 31, 2006,
    the total size of the rolling-stock fleet was approximately
    19,130 units. Most of this fleet is serviced by our own
    mechanics who work at various maintenance sites and facilities.
    We believe that these vehicles generally are well maintained and
    adequate for our present operations.

ITEM 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are from time to time a party to various lawsuits, claims and
    other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These actions typically seek, among other things,
    compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract

and/or

property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
    losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all
    such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record reserves when
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not believe that any
    of these proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, would be
    expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Dividends

We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to
    finance the growth, development and expansion of our business.
    Accordingly, we currently do not intend to declare or pay any
    cash dividends on our common stock in the immediate future. The
    declaration, payment and amount of future cash dividends, if
    any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after
    taking into account various factors. These factors include our
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flows from
    operations, current and anticipated capital requirements and
    expansion plans, the income tax laws then in effect and the
    requirements of Delaware law. In addition, as discussed in

“Debt Instruments—Credit Facility”

in
    Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” our credit
    facility includes limitations on the payment of cash dividends
    without the consent of the lenders.



Performance
    Graph

The following Performance Graph and related information shall
    not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be
    “filed” with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
    nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any
    future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that
    we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.

The following graph compares, for the period from
    December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2006, the cumulative
    stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total
    return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (the
    S&P 500 Index), the Russell 2000 Index, and a peer group
    index previously selected by our management that includes six
    public companies within our industry (the Peer Group). The
    comparison assumes that $100 was invested on December 31,
    2001 in our common stock, the S&P 500 Index, the Russell
    2000 Index and the Peer Group, and further assumes all dividends
    were reinvested. The stock price performance reflected on the
    following graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock
    price performance.

The Peer Group is composed of Dycom Industries, Inc., MasTec,
    Inc., Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., Shaw Group,
    Inc., InfraSource Services, Inc. and Pike Electric Corporation.
    The companies in the Peer Group were selected because they
    comprise a broad group of publicly held corporations, each of
    which has some operations similar to ours. When taken as a
    whole, the Peer Group more closely resembles our total business
    than any individual company in the group.

ITEM 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations should be read in
    conjunction with our historical consolidated financial
    statements and related notes thereto in Item 8
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The
    discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are
    based upon our current expectations and are subject to
    uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may
    differ materially from these expectations due to inaccurate
    assumptions and known or unknown risks and uncertainties,
    including those identified in “Uncertainty of
    Forward-Looking Statements and Information” below and in
    Item 1A “Risk Factors.”

Introduction

We are a leading national provider of specialty contracting
    services, offering

end-to-end

network solutions to the electric power, gas,
    telecommunications, cable television and specialty services
    industries. We believe that we are the largest contractor
    servicing the transmission and distribution sector of the North
    American electric utility industry. We derive our revenues from
    one reportable segment. Our customers include electric power,
    gas, telecommunications and cable television companies, as well
    as commercial, industrial and governmental entities. We had
    consolidated revenues for the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2006 of approximately $2.13 billion, of
    which 67% was attributable to electric power and gas customers,
    15% to telecommunications and cable television customers and 18%
    to ancillary services, such as inside electrical wiring,
    intelligent traffic networks, cable and control systems for
    light rail lines, airports and highways, and specialty rock
    trenching, directional boring and road milling for industrial
    and commercial customers.

Our customers include many of the leading companies in the
    industries we serve. We have developed strong strategic
    alliances with numerous customers and strive to develop and
    maintain our status as a preferred vendor to our customers. We
    enter into various types of contracts, including competitive
    unit price, cost-plus (or time and materials basis), and fixed
    price (or lump sum basis), the final terms and prices of which
    we frequently negotiate with the customer. Although the terms of
    our contracts vary considerably, most are made on either a unit
    price or fixed price basis in which we agree to do the work for
    a price per unit of work performed (unit price) or for a fixed
    amount for the entire project (fixed price). We complete a
    substantial majority of our fixed price projects within one
    year, while we frequently provide maintenance and repair work
    under open-ended unit price or cost-plus master service
    agreements that are renewable annually. Some of our customers
    require us to post performance and payment bonds upon execution
    of the contract, depending upon the nature of the work to be
    performed.

We generally recognize revenue on our unit price and cost-plus
    contracts when units are completed or services are performed.
    For our fixed price contracts, we typically record revenues as
    work on the contract progresses on a

percentage-of-completion

basis. Under this valuation method, revenue is recognized based
    on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion
    to total estimated costs to complete the contract. Fixed price
    contracts generally include retainage provisions under which a
    percentage of the contract price is withheld until the project
    is complete and has been accepted by our customer.

Seasonality;
    Fluctuations of Results

Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to
    seasonal variations. These variations are influenced by weather,
    customer spending patterns, bidding seasons and holidays.
    Typically, our revenues are lowest in the first quarter of the
    year because cold, snowy or wet conditions cause delays. The
    second quarter is typically better than the first, as some
    projects begin, but continued cold and wet weather can often
    impact second quarter productivity. The third quarter is
    typically the best of the year, as a greater number of projects
    are underway and weather is more accommodating to work on
    projects. Revenues during the fourth quarter of the year are
    typically lower than the third quarter but higher than the
    second quarter. Many projects are completed in the fourth
    quarter and revenues often are impacted positively by customers
    seeking to spend their capital budget before the end of the
    year; however, the holiday season and inclement weather
    sometimes can cause delays and thereby reduce revenues.

Additionally, our industry can be highly cyclical. As a result,
    our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in
    new projects in various geographic regions in the United States.
    The financial condition of our customers and their access to
    capital, variations in the margins of projects performed during
    any particular quarter,



regional economic conditions, timing of acquisitions and the
    timing and magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs may also
    materially affect quarterly results. Accordingly, our operating
    results in any particular quarter or year may not be indicative
    of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or for
    any other year. You should read

“Understanding Gross
    Margins”

and

“Outlook”

below for
    additional discussion of trends and challenges that may affect
    our financial condition and results of operations.

Understanding
    Gross Margins

Our gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of
    revenues. Cost of services consists primarily of salaries, wages
    and benefits to employees, depreciation, fuel and other
    equipment expenses, equipment rentals, subcontracted services,
    insurance, facilities expenses, materials and parts and
    supplies. Various factors — some controllable, some
    not — impact our gross margins on a quarterly or
    annual basis.

Seasonal and Geographical.

As discussed above,
    seasonal patterns can have a significant impact on gross
    margins. Generally, business is slower in the winter months
    versus the warmer months of the year. This can be offset
    somewhat by increased demand for electrical service and repair
    work resulting from severe weather. In addition, the mix of
    business conducted in different parts of the country will affect
    margins, as some parts of the country offer the opportunity for
    higher gross margins than others.

Weather.

Adverse or favorable weather
    conditions can impact gross margins in a given period. For
    example, it is typical in the first quarter of any fiscal year
    that  parts of the country may experience snow or rainfall that
    may negatively impact our revenue and gross margin. In many
    cases, projects may be delayed or temporarily placed on hold.
    Conversely, in periods when weather remains dry and temperatures
    are accommodating, more work can be done, sometimes with less
    cost, which would have a favorable impact on gross margins. In
    some cases, strong storms or hurricanes can provide us with high
    margin emergency restoration service work, which generally has a
    positive impact on margins.

Revenue Mix.

The mix of revenue derived from
    the industries we serve will impact gross margins. Changes in
    our customers’ spending patterns in each of the industries
    we serve can cause an imbalance in supply and demand and,
    therefore, affect margins and mix of revenue by industry served.

Service and Maintenance versus
    Installation.

In general, installation work has a
    higher gross margin than maintenance work. This is because
    installation work is often obtained on a fixed price basis which
    has higher risk than other types of pricing arrangements. We
    typically derive approximately 50% of our revenue from
    maintenance work, which is performed under pre-established or
    negotiated prices or cost-plus pricing arrangements. Thus, a
    higher portion of installation work in a given period may result
    in a higher gross margin.

Subcontract Work.

Work that is subcontracted
    to other service providers generally has lower gross margins. An
    increase in subcontract work in a given period may contribute to
    a decrease in gross margin. We typically subcontract
    approximately 10% - 15% of our work to other service providers.

Materials versus Labor.

Margins may be lower
    on projects on which we furnish materials as material prices are
    generally more predictable than labor costs. Consequently, we
    generally are not able to mark up materials as much as labor
    costs. In a given period, a higher percentage of work that has a
    higher materials component may decrease overall gross margin.

Depreciation.

We include depreciation in cost
    of services. This is common practice in our industry, but can
    make comparability to other companies difficult. This must be
    taken into consideration when comparing us to other companies.

Insurance.

Gross margins could be impacted by
    fluctuations in insurance accruals related to our deductibles in
    the period in which such adjustments are made. As of
    December 31, 2006, we had a deductible of $1.0 million
    per occurrence related to employer’s and general liability
    insurance and a deductible of $2.0 million per occurrence
    for automobile liability and workers’ compensation
    insurance. In addition, beginning August 1, 2006, we have
    been subject to an additional cumulative aggregate liability of
    up to $2.0 million on workers’ compensation claims in
    excess of $2.0 million per occurrence per policy year. We
    also have an employee health care benefit plan for



employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements, which
    is subject to a deductible of $250,000 per claimant per
    year.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily
    of compensation and related benefits to management,
    administrative salaries and benefits, marketing, office rent and
    utilities, communications, professional fees, bad debt expense,
    letter of credit fees and gains and losses on the sale of
    property and equipment.

Revenues.

Revenues increased
    $272.4 million, or 14.7%, to $2.13 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. Revenues for 2006 included a
    lower volume of emergency restoration services provided to our
    electric power and gas customers as compared to 2005, which
    included the highest volume of emergency restoration services in
    our history in the wake of hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region
    of the United States. The total revenues associated with
    emergency restoration services in 2005 were approximately
    $167.6 million as compared to $106.2 million of
    emergency restoration services in 2006. Excluding emergency
    restoration service revenues from both periods, revenues derived
    from the electric power and gas network services industry
    increased in 2006 approximately $240.0 million, or 22.1%.
    Actual revenues derived from the electric power and gas network
    services industry, including emergency restoration services
    revenues, increased approximately $181.7 million, or 14.6%.
    Revenues from the telecommunications and cable television
    network services industry increased by approximately
    $29.8 million, or 10.3%, and revenues from ancillary
    services customers increased by approximately
    $60.9 million, or 18.6%, for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. These increases in revenues are
    primarily a result of a higher volume of work from increased
    spending by our customers resulting from the continued improving
    financial health of our customers as well as improved pricing.

Gross profit.

Gross profit increased
    $59.1 million, or 23.0%, to $315.8 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. As a percentage of revenues,
    gross margin increased from 13.8% for the year ended
    December 31,



2005 to 14.8% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The
    increase in gross margins for the year ended December 31,
    2006 was primarily attributable to higher margins on work from
    our electric power and gas network services customers and our
    telecommunications and cable television network services
    customers due to continued strengthening market conditions,
    improved pricing and our margin enhancement initiatives. Margins
    improved during 2006 on work from our electric power and gas
    network services customers despite the lower volume of higher
    margin emergency restoration services in 2006 compared to 2005,
    as discussed above. In addition, during the first half of 2006,
    we achieved higher margins on certain jobs due to better
    productivity and cost control and relatively mild weather as
    compared to the first half of 2005, which was negatively
    impacted by cost overruns during the period and weather delays
    on certain projects during the first quarter.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses decreased $5.2 million, or 2.8%, to
    $183.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.
    The $5.2 million decrease relates primarily to a decrease
    in professional fees in the amount of $9.9 million related
    to costs incurred for our margin enhancement program and for
    specific bidding activity during the year ended
    December 31, 2005 that were not incurred during the year
    ended December 31, 2006, as well as lower legal costs from
    ongoing litigation during the year ended December 31, 2006.
    These decreases were partially offset by an $8.6 million
    increase in salaries and benefits costs associated with
    increased personnel, costs of living adjustments and increased
    performance bonuses. In addition, we recorded net losses from
    sales of property and equipment in the amount of
    $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
    compared to net gains from the sales of property and equipment
    in the amount of $0.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Goodwill impairment.

A goodwill impairment
    charge in the amount of $56.8 million was recorded during
    the year ended December 31, 2006, while no goodwill
    impairment was recorded during the year ended December 31,
    2005. As part of our 2006 annual test for goodwill impairment,
    goodwill in the amount of $56.8 million was written off as
    a non-cash operating expense associated with a decrease in the
    expected future demand for the services of one of our
    businesses, which historically served the cable television
    industry.

Interest expense.

Interest expense increased
    $2.9 million to $26.8 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, primarily due to the expense of
    unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.3 million. We
    replaced our prior credit facility and expensed the remaining
    balance of unamortized debt issuance costs of $2.6 million.
    In addition, we expensed $0.7 million of unamortized debt
    issuance costs related to the repurchase of a portion of our
    4.0% convertible subordinated notes during the second
    quarter of 2006. This increase was partially offset by lower
    interest expense associated with lower outstanding borrowings
    under the credit facilities during 2006 as compared to 2005.

Interest income.

Interest income was
    $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to $7.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005. The increase in interest income
    primarily relates to a higher average investment balance and
    higher average interest rates for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

Provision (benefit) for income taxes.

The
    provision for income taxes was $47.6 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, with an effective tax rate of
    73.2%, compared to a provision of $22.7 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005, with an effective tax rate of
    43.4%. The higher tax rate in 2006 results primarily from the
    goodwill impairment charge recorded during the fourth quarter of
    2006, the majority of which is not deductible for tax purposes.
    Excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment charge, the
    impact of which is 33.9%, the effective tax rate would have been
    39.3% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease
    after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment charge is
    primarily due to the impact of the recording of a refund from a
    multi-year state tax claim during the second quarter of 2006 and
    the impact of tax-exempt interest income from investments in
    2006, which were not held in 2005.

    compared to 2004

Revenues.

Revenues increased
    $232.1 million, or 14.3%, to $1.86 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2005, with revenues derived from
    the electric power and gas network services industry increasing
    by approximately $188.6 million, or 17.9%, revenues from
    the telecommunications and cable television network services
    industry increasing by approximately $16.5 million, or 6.1%
    and revenues from ancillary services increasing by approximately
    $27.0 million, or 9.0%. The increase in revenues was a
    result of a higher volume of work from increased



spending by our customers in these industries due to the
    improving financial health of these customers. Revenues in 2005
    were positively impacted by a larger volume of storm restoration
    services provided during 2005 to our electric power and gas
    customers after the impact of hurricanes in the south central
    and southeastern United States.

Gross profit.

Gross profit increased
    $75.4 million, or 41.5%, to $256.7 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005. As a percentage of revenues,
    gross margin increased from 11.2% for the year ended
    December 31, 2004 to 13.8% for the year ended
    December 31, 2005. Gross profit was favorably impacted by
    an increased volume of higher margin storm restoration services
    as discussed above. In addition, the increase in gross margins
    for the year ended December 31, 2005 over the year ended
    December 31, 2004 was attributable to higher margins on
    work from our electric power and gas network services customers,
    partially due to our margin enhancement initiatives, better
    weather in certain areas during the first half of 2005 and
    better overall fixed cost absorption as a result of higher
    revenues.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased $16.7 million, or 9.7%, to
    $188.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.
    Salaries and benefits costs increased by $13.7 million
    associated with increased performance bonus costs, an increased
    number of personnel and cost of living adjustments. During the
    year ended December 31, 2004, we incurred $6.3 million
    in professional fees associated with meeting the requirements of
    the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 versus $1.0 million during
    the year ended December 31, 2005, partially due to the
    hiring of additional internal personnel, as discussed above;
    however, this decrease in professional fees was offset by
    incurring $5.7 million in higher costs during the year
    ended December 31, 2005 associated with our margin
    enhancement initiatives, increased bidding activity and ongoing
    litigation. In addition, net losses from sales of property and
    equipment increased from $0.9 million in 2004 to
    $3.5 million in 2005.

Interest expense.

Interest expense decreased
    $1.1 million to $23.9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, due to lower levels of debt outstanding.

Interest income.

Interest income was
    $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005,
    compared to $2.6 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2004. The increase in interest income
    primarily related to a higher average cash balance and higher
    average interest rates for the year ended December 31, 2005
    as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004.

Provision (benefit) for income taxes.

The
    provision for income taxes was $22.7 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005, with an effective tax rate of
    43.4%, compared to a benefit of $3.5 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2004, with an effective tax rate of
    27.3%. The effective rate for income taxes for both periods
    differs from the statutory rate due to the impact of estimated
    non-deductible items on estimated income or loss and the
    recording of additional contingency reserves.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Cash
    Requirements

We anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, which
    totaled $383.7 million as of December 31, 2006, our
    credit facility, short term investments, if any, and our future
    cash flow from operations will provide sufficient cash to enable
    us to meet our future operating needs, debt service requirements
    and planned capital expenditures and to facilitate our future
    ability to grow. Initiatives to rebuild the United States
    electric power grid or momentum in deployment of fiber to the
    premises  may require a significant amount of additional working
    capital. We also evaluate opportunities for strategic
    acquisitions from time to time that may require cash. However,
    we feel that we have adequate cash and availability under our
    credit facility to meet such needs, although, depending on the
    size and number of any future acquisitions, we may need
    additional cash to fund one or more of those transactions.

    and Uses of Cash

As of December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents
    of $383.7 million, working capital of $656.2 million
    and long-term debt, net of current maturities, in the amount of
    $413.8 million, which consists of convertible subordinated
    notes. We also had $140.4 million of letters of credit
    outstanding under our credit facility.



During the year ended December 31, 2006, operating
    activities provided net cash flow of $120.6 million. Cash
    flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our
    services, operating margins and the type of services we provide.
    We used net cash in investing activities of $38.5 million,
    including $48.5 million used for capital expenditures,
    offset by $10.0 million of proceeds from the sale of
    equipment. We also purchased and sold $511.7 million of
    short-term investments. We used net cash in financing activities
    of $2.7 million, resulting primarily from a
    $7.5 million repayment under the term loan portion of our
    prior credit facility coupled with $6.0 million in debt
    issuance costs, partially offset by $5.8 million in net
    borrowings and $3.9 million for the tax impact related to
    stock-based equity awards. The $5.8 million in net
    borrowings primarily relates to the issuance of our
    3.75% convertible subordinated notes and the repurchase of
    our 4.0% convertible subordinated notes as discussed below.

Debt
    Instruments

Credit
    Facilities

As of December 31, 2006, we had an amended and restated
    credit facility with various lenders which provides for a
    $300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility
    maturing on June 12, 2011 (the credit facility). The credit
    facility amended and restated our prior credit facility. Subject
    to the conditions specified in the credit facility, we have the
    option to increase the revolving commitments under the credit
    facility by up to an additional $125.0 million from time to
    time upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing
    lenders. Borrowings under the credit facility are to be used for
    working capital, capital expenditures and other general
    corporate purposes. The entire amount of the credit facility is
    available for the issuance of letters of credit.

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately
    $140.4 million of letters of credit issued under the credit
    facility and no outstanding revolving loans. The remaining
    $159.6 million was available for revolving loans or issuing
    new letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the credit
    facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either
    (a) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the credit facility)
    plus 1.25% to 1.875%, as determined by the ratio of our total
    funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit
    agreement), or (b) the base rate (as described below) plus
    0.25% to 0.875%, as determined by the ratio of our total funded
    debt to consolidated EBITDA. Letters of credit issued under the
    credit facility are subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.25%
    to 1.875%, based on the ratio of our total funded debt to
    consolidated EBITDA. We are also subject to a commitment fee of
    0.25% to 0.35%, based on the ratio of our total funded debt to
    consolidated EBITDA, on any unused availability under the credit
    facility. The base rate equals the higher of (i) the
    Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 1/2
    of 1% and (ii) the bank’s prime rate.

The credit facility contains certain covenants, including
    covenants with respect to maximum funded debt to consolidated
    EBITDA, maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA, minimum
    interest coverage and minimum consolidated net worth, in each
    case as specified in the credit facility. For purposes of
    calculating the maximum funded debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio
    and the maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio, our
    maximum funded debt and maximum senior debt are reduced by all
    cash and cash equivalents (as defined in the credit facility)
    held by us in excess of $25.0 million. As of
    December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all of our
    covenants. The credit facility limits certain acquisitions,
    mergers and consolidations, capital expenditures, asset sales
    and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to certain
    exceptions, prohibits liens on material assets. The credit
    facility also limits the payment of dividends and stock
    repurchase programs in any fiscal year to an annual aggregate
    amount of up to 25% of our consolidated net income (plus the
    amount of non-cash charges that reduced such consolidated net
    income) for the prior fiscal year. The credit facility does not
    limit dividend payments or other distributions payable solely in
    capital stock. The credit facility provides for customary events
    of default and carries cross-default provisions with all of our
    existing subordinated notes, our continuing indemnity and
    security agreement with our surety and all of our other debt
    instruments exceeding $10.0 million in borrowings. If an
    event of default (as defined in the credit facility) occurs and
    is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
    forth in the credit facility, amounts outstanding under the
    credit facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared
    immediately due and payable.

The credit facility is secured by a pledge of all of the capital
    stock of our U.S. subsidiaries, 65% of the capital stock of
    our foreign subsidiaries and substantially all of our assets.
    Our U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the repayment of



all amounts due under the credit facility. Our obligations under
    the credit facility constitute designated senior indebtedness
    under our 3.75%, 4.0% and 4.5% convertible subordinated
    notes.

As of December 31, 2005, we had a $182.0 million
    credit facility with various lenders (the prior facility). The
    prior facility was amended during 2006 to permit, among other
    things, the issuance of our 3.75% convertible subordinated notes
    and our cash tender offer for our 4.0% convertible subordinated
    notes, each as described below. Upon the amendment and
    restatement of our credit facility in 2006, as described above,
    the obligations under the prior facility were terminated, and
    related unamortized debt issuance costs in the amount of
    approximately $2.6 million were expensed and included in
    interest expense in 2006. As of December 31, 2005, we had
    approximately $142.6 million of letters of credit
    outstanding under the prior credit facility and
    $7.5 million outstanding under the prior credit facility as
    a term loan.

4.0% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

As of December 31, 2006, we had $33.3 million
    aggregate principal amount of 4.0% convertible subordinated
    notes due 2007 (4.0% Notes) outstanding, which was
    classified as a current obligation as these 4.0% Notes will
    mature within the next twelve months. The 4.0% Notes are
    convertible into shares of our common stock at a price of
    $54.53 per share, subject to adjustment as a result of
    certain events. The sale of the notes and the shares issuable
    upon conversion thereof was registered in a registration
    statement filed with the SEC. The 4.0% Notes require
    semi-annual interest payments on July 1 and
    December 31 until the notes mature on July 1, 2007. We
    have the option to redeem some or all of the 4.0% Notes at
    specified redemption prices, together with accrued and unpaid
    interest. If certain fundamental changes occur, as described in
    the indenture under which we issued the 4.0% Notes, holders of
    the 4.0% Notes may require us to purchase all or part of
    the notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal
    amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. During 2006, we
    conducted a cash tender offer for all of the 4.0% Notes,
    which resulted in the repurchase of $139.2 million
    outstanding principal amount of the 4.0% Notes. As a result
    of the repurchase of a portion of the 4.0% Notes, we
    recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately
    $2.1 million during 2006, which was partially offset by
    costs associated with the tender offer of approximately
    $0.5 million. In addition, approximately $0.7 million
    in related unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the
    retirement of a portion of the repurchased 4.0% Notes was
    expensed and included in interest expense in 2006.

4.5% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

As of December 31, 2006, we had $270.0 million
    aggregate principal amount of 4.5% convertible subordinated
    notes due 2023(4.5% Notes) outstanding. The resale of the
    notes and the shares issuable upon conversion thereof was
    registered for the benefit of the holders in a shelf
    registration statement filed with the SEC. The 4.5% Notes
    require semi-annual interest payments on April 1 and
    October 1 until the notes mature on October 1, 2023.

The 4.5% Notes are convertible into shares of our common
    stock based on an initial conversion rate of 89.7989 shares
    of Quanta’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of
    4.5% Notes (which is equal to an initial conversion price
    of approximately $11.14 per share), subject to adjustment
    as a result of certain events. The 4.5% Notes are
    convertible by the holder (i) during any fiscal quarter if
    the last reported sale price of our common stock is greater than
    or equal to 120% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading
    days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the
    first trading day of such fiscal quarter, (ii) during the
    five business day period after any five consecutive trading day
    period in which the trading price per note for each day of that
    period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported
    sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate,
    (iii) upon us calling the notes for redemption or
    (iv) upon the occurrence of specified corporate
    transactions. If the notes become convertible under any of these
    circumstances, we have the option to deliver cash, shares of our
    common stock or a combination thereof, with the amount of cash
    determined in accordance with the terms of the indenture under
    which the notes were issued. During each quarter of 2006, the
    market price condition described in clause (i) above was
    satisfied, and the notes were convertible at the option of the
    holder, although no holders exercised their right to convert.
    The notes are presently convertible at the option of each
    holder, and the conversion period will expire on March 31,
    2007, but may resume upon the satisfaction of the market
    condition or other conditions in future periods.

Beginning October 8, 2008, we may redeem for cash some or
    all of the 4.5% Notes at the principal amount thereof plus
    accrued and unpaid interest. The holders of the 4.5% Notes
    may require us to repurchase all or some of



their notes at the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
    unpaid interest on October 1, 2008, 2013 or 2018, or upon
    the occurrence of a fundamental change, as defined by the
    indenture under which we issued the notes. We must pay any
    required repurchases on October 1, 2008 in cash. For all
    other required repurchases, we have the option to deliver cash,
    shares of our common stock or a combination thereof to satisfy
    our repurchase obligation. If we were to satisfy any required
    repurchase obligation with shares of our common stock, the
    number of shares delivered will equal the dollar amount to be
    paid in common stock divided by 98.5% of the market price of our
    common stock, as defined by the indenture. The right to settle
    for shares of common stock can be surrendered by us. The
    4.5% Notes carry cross-default provisions with our other
    debt instruments exceeding $10.0 million in borrowings,
    which includes our existing credit facility.

3.75% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

As of December 31, 2006, we had $143.8 million
    aggregate principal amount of 3.75% convertible
    subordinated notes due 2026 (3.75% Notes) outstanding. The
    resale of the notes and the shares issuable upon conversion
    thereof was registered for the benefit of the holders in a shelf
    registration statement filed with the SEC. The 3.75% Notes
    mature on April 30, 2026 and bear interest at the annual
    rate of 3.75%, payable semi-annually on April 30 and
    October 30, until maturity.

The 3.75% Notes are convertible into our common stock,
    based on an initial conversion rate of 44.6229 shares of
    our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 3.75% Notes
    (which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately
    $22.41 per share), subject to adjustment as a result of
    certain events. The 3.75% Notes are convertible by the
    holder (i) during any fiscal quarter if the closing price
    of our common stock is greater than 130% of the conversion price
    for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive
    trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately
    preceding fiscal quarter, (ii) upon our calling the
    3.75% Notes for redemption, (iii) upon the occurrence
    of specified distributions to holders of our common stock or
    specified corporate transactions or (iv) at any time on or
    after March 1, 2026 until the business day immediately
    preceding the maturity date of the 3.75% Notes. If the
    3.75% Notes become convertible under any of these
    circumstances, we have the option to deliver cash, shares of our
    common stock or a combination thereof, with the amount of cash
    determined in accordance with the terms of the indenture under
    which the notes were issued. The holders of the 3.75% Notes
    who convert their notes in connection with certain change in
    control transactions, as defined in the indenture, may be
    entitled to a make whole premium in the form of an increase in
    the conversion rate. In the event of a change in control, in
    lieu of paying holders a make whole premium, if applicable, we
    may elect, in some circumstances, to adjust the conversion rate
    and related conversion obligations so that the 3.75% Notes
    are convertible into shares of the acquiring or surviving
    company.

Beginning on April 30, 2010 until April 30, 2013, we
    may redeem for cash all or part of the 3.75% Notes at a
    price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and
    unpaid interest, if the closing price of our common stock is
    equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion price then in
    effect for the 3.75% Notes for at least 20 trading days in
    the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day
    immediately prior to the date of mailing of the notice of
    redemption. In addition, we may redeem for cash all or part of
    the 3.75% Notes at any time on or after April 30, 2010
    at certain redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
    Beginning with the six-month interest period commencing on
    April 30, 2010, and for each six-month interest period
    thereafter, we will be required to pay contingent interest on
    any outstanding 3.75% Notes during the applicable interest
    period if the average trading price of the 3.75% Notes
    reaches a specified threshold. The contingent interest payable
    within any applicable interest period will equal an annual rate
    of 0.25% of the average trading price of the 3.75% Notes
    during a five trading day reference period.

The holders of the 3.75% Notes may require us to repurchase
    all or a part of the notes in cash on each of April 30,
    2013, April 30, 2016 and April 30, 2021, and in the
    event of a change in control, as defined in the indenture, at a
    purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
    3.75% Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. The
    3.75% Notes carry cross-default provisions with our other
    debt instruments exceeding $20.0 million in borrowings,
    which includes our existing credit facility.



Off-Balance
    Sheet Transactions

As is common in our industry, we have entered into certain
    off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of
    business that result in risks not directly reflected in our
    balance sheets. Our significant off-balance sheet transactions
    include liabilities associated with non-cancelable operating
    leases, letter of credit obligations and surety guarantees
    entered into in the normal course of business. We have not
    engaged in any off-balance sheet financing arrangements through
    special purpose entities.

Leases

We enter into non-cancelable operating leases for many of our
    facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow us to
    conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for the use
    of facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing
    them. We may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the
    end of its term, in which case we are typically liable to the
    lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the
    lease.

We have guaranteed the residual value of the underlying assets
    under certain of our equipment operating leases at the date of
    termination of such leases. We have agreed to pay any difference
    between this residual value and the fair market value of each
    underlying asset as of the lease termination date. As of
    December 31, 2006, the maximum guaranteed residual value
    was approximately $108.4 million. We believe that no
    significant payments will be made as a result of the difference
    between the fair market value of the leased equipment and the
    guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no assurance
    that future significant payments will not be required.

Letters
    of Credit

Certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure
    reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf,
    such as to beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance
    programs. In addition, from time to time some customers require
    us to post letters of credit to ensure payment to our
    subcontractors and vendors under those contracts and to
    guarantee performance under our contracts. Such letters of
    credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial
    institution. The letter of credit commits the issuer to pay
    specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the
    holder claims that we have failed to perform specified actions
    in accordance with the terms of the letter of credit. If this
    were to occur, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of
    the letter of credit. Depending on the circumstances of such a
    reimbursement, we may also have to record a charge to earnings
    for the reimbursement. We do not believe that it is likely that
    any claims will be made under a letter of credit in the
    foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2006, we had $140.4 million in
    letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility
    primarily to secure obligations under our casualty insurance
    program. These are irrevocable stand-by letters of credit with
    maturities expiring at various times throughout 2007. Upon
    maturity, it is expected that the majority of these letters of
    credit will be renewed for subsequent one-year periods.

Performance
    Bonds

Many customers, particularly in connection with new
    construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds
    issued by a financial institution known as a surety. These bonds
    provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under
    the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and
    vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay
    subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the
    surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must
    reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs.
    Under our continuing indemnity and security agreement with the
    surety, with the consent of our lenders under our credit
    facility, we have granted security interests in certain of our
    assets to collateralize our obligations to the surety. We may be
    required to post letters of credit or other collateral in favor
    of the surety or our customers in the future. Posting letters of
    credit in favor of the surety or our customers would reduce the
    borrowing availability under our credit facility. To date, we
    have not been required to make any reimbursements to the surety
    for bond-related costs. We believe that it is unlikely that we
    will have to fund significant claims under our surety
    arrangements in the foreseeable future. As of December 31,
    2006, an aggregate of approximately $650.7 million in
    original face amount of bonds issued by the surety were
    outstanding. Our estimated cost to complete these bonded
    projects was approximately $125.4 million as of
    December 31, 2006.

Excluded from the above table is interest associated with
    borrowings under the credit facility because both the amount
    borrowed and applicable interest rate are variable. As of
    December 31, 2006, we had no borrowing under our credit
    facility. In addition, our multi-employer pension plan
    contributions are determined annually based on our union
    employee payrolls, which cannot be determined for future periods
    in advance.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

We grant credit under normal payment terms, generally without
    collateral, to our customers, which include electric power and
    gas companies, telecommunications and cable television system
    operators, governmental entities, general contractors, and
    builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial
    properties located primarily in the United States. Consequently,
    we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in
    business and economic factors throughout the United States.
    However, we generally have certain statutory lien rights with
    respect to services provided. Under certain circumstances such
    as foreclosures or negotiated settlements, we may take title to
    the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of
    receivables. No customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues
    for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 or 2006.

Litigation

We are from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and
    other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These actions typically seek, among other things,
    compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract

and/or

property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
    losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all
    such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record reserves when
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not believe that any
    of these proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, would be
    expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Related
    Party Transactions

In the normal course of business, we enter into transactions
    from time to time with related parties. These transactions
    typically take the form of facility leases with prior owners of
    certain acquired companies.

Inflation

Due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the
    years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, inflation did
    not have a significant effect on our results.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for
    Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments — An Amendment of
    FASB Statements No. 133 and 140.”
    SFAS No. 155 provides entities with relief from having
    to separately determine the fair value of an embedded derivative
    that would otherwise be required to be bifurcated from its host
    contract in accordance with SFAS No. 133.
    SFAS No. 155 allows an entity to make an irrevocable
    election to measure such a hybrid financial instrument at fair
    value in its entirety, with changes in fair value recognized in
    earnings. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial
    instruments acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement event
    occurring after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal
    year that



begins after September 15, 2006. We do not believe that our
    adoption of SFAS No. 155 on January 1, 2007 will
    have a material impact on our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
    interpretation of SFAS 109, Accounting for Income
    Taxes” (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a
    comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure,
    present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain
    tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
    Under FIN 48, tax positions may be recognized in the
    financial statements when it is more likely than not the
    position will be sustained upon examination by the tax
    authorities. The amount recognized for such tax positions is the
    largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent
    likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48
    also revises disclosure requirements to include an annual
    tabular rollforward of unrecognized tax benefits. The provisions
    of this interpretation are required to be adopted for fiscal
    periods beginning after December 15, 2006. We will be
    required to apply the provisions of FIN 48 to all tax
    positions upon initial adoption with any cumulative effect
    adjustment to be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated
    deficit. While we have not yet completed our final evaluation of
    the impact of our January 1, 2007 adoption of FIN 48,
    we do not expect such adoption to have a material impact on our
    financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157
    defines fair value, establishes methods used to measure fair
    value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
    periods. We are currently analyzing the provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 and determining how it will affect our
    accounting policies and procedures and have not yet made a
    determination of the impact that our January 1, 2008
    adoption will have on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of
    Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
    Current Year Financial Statements” (SAB 108), which
    provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior
    year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for
    the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 requires
    that the materiality of the effect of a misstated amount be
    evaluated on each financial statement and the related financial
    statement disclosures, and that materiality evaluation be based
    on quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 is
    effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006.
    We adopted SAB 108 on December 31, 2006, and this
    guidance did not have a material impact on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115”. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to
    choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value that are not currently
    required to be measured. Unrealized gains and losses on items
    for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in
    earnings. SFAS No. 159 does not affect any existing
    accounting literature that requires certain assets and
    liabilities to be carried at fair value. SFAS No. 159
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. We will adopt SFAS No. 159 on January 1,
    2008, but have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our
    consolidated financial statements.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
    results of operations are based on our consolidated financial
    statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
    The preparation of these consolidated financial statements
    requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of
    contingent assets and liabilities known to exist at the date of
    the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We
    evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical
    experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
    be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance
    that actual results will not differ from those estimates.
    Management has reviewed its development and selection of
    critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our
    Board of Directors. We believe the



following accounting policies affect our more significant
    judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
    consolidated financial statements:

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue when
    services are performed except when work is being performed under
    a fixed price contract. Revenues from fixed price contracts are
    recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to
    total estimated costs for each contract. Such contracts
    generally provide that the customer accept completion of
    progress to date and compensate us for services rendered,
    measured typically in terms of units installed, hours expended
    or some other measure of progress. Contract costs typically
    include all direct material, labor and subcontract costs and
    those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as
    indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs.
    Provisions for the total estimated losses on uncompleted
    contracts are made in the period in which such losses are
    determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions,
    estimated profitability and final contract settlements may
    result in revisions to costs and income and their effects are
    recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.

Self-Insurance.

We are insured for
    employer’s liability and general liability claims, subject
    to a deductible of $1.0 million per occurrence, and for
    auto liability and workers’ compensation subject to a
    deductible of $2.0 million per occurrence. In addition,
    beginning August 1, 2006, we have been subject to an
    additional cumulative aggregate liability of up to
    $2.0 million on workers’ compensation claims in excess
    of $2.0 million per occurrence per policy year. We also
    have an employee health care benefit plan for employees not
    subject to collective bargaining agreements, which is subject to
    a deductible of $250,000 per claimant per year. Losses up
    to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates
    of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of
    claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from a
    third-party actuary. However, insurance liabilities are
    difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors,
    including the severity of an injury, the determination of our
    liability in proportion to other parties, the number of
    incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety
    program. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical
    trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate.

Our casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods from
    August 1, 2000 to February 28, 2003 has been
    experiencing financial distress but is currently paying valid
    claims. In the event that this insurer’s financial
    situation further deteriorates, we may be required to pay
    certain obligations that otherwise would have been paid by this
    insurer. We estimate that the total future claim amount that
    this insurer is currently obligated to pay on our behalf for the
    above mentioned policy periods is approximately
    $6.2 million; however, our estimate of the potential range
    of these future claim amounts is between $3.6 million and
    $8.5 million. The actual amounts ultimately paid by us
    related to these claims, if any, may vary materially from the
    above range and could be impacted by further claims development
    and the extent to which the insurer could not honor its
    obligations. We continue to monitor the financial situation of
    this insurer and analyze any alternative actions that could be
    pursued. In any event, we do not expect any failure by this
    insurer to honor its obligations to us, or any alternative
    actions that we may pursue, to have a material adverse impact on
    our financial condition; however, the impact could be material
    to our results of operations or cash flow in a given period.

Valuation of Intangibles and Long-Lived
    Assets.

SFAS No. 142 provides that
    goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful
    lives not be amortized but, instead, must be tested at least
    annually for impairment, and intangible assets that have finite
    useful lives should continue to be amortized over their useful
    lives. SFAS No. 142 also provides specific guidance
    for testing goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets
    for impairment. SFAS No. 142 does not allow increases
    in the carrying value of reporting units that may result from
    our impairment test; therefore, we may record goodwill
    impairments in the future, even when the aggregate fair value of
    our reporting units and the company as a whole may increase.
    Goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment
    between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change
    that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
    reporting unit below its carrying amount. Examples of such
    events or circumstances may include a significant change in
    business climate or a loss of key personnel, among others.
    SFAS No. 142 requires that management make certain
    estimates and assumptions in order to allocate goodwill to
    reporting units and to determine the fair value of reporting
    unit net assets and liabilities, including, among other things,
    an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, cost
    of capital and growth rates, which could significantly impact
    the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets.
    Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and
    our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. As
    part of our 2006 annual test for goodwill impairment, goodwill
    in the amount of $56.8 million was written of as a non-cash
    operating expense. The goodwill



impairment is associated with a decrease in the expected future
    demand for the services of one of our businesses, which has
    historically served the cable television industry.

We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
    not be realizable. If an evaluation is required, the estimated
    future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are
    compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if an
    impairment of such asset is necessary. Estimating future cash
    flows requires significant judgment, and our projections may
    vary from cash flows eventually realized. The effect of any
    impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair
    value of such asset and its carrying value. In addition, we
    estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets and other
    intangibles. We periodically review factors to determine whether
    these lives are appropriate.

Current and Non-Current Accounts and Notes Receivable
    and Provision for Doubtful Accounts.

We provide
    an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account
    or note receivable is considered doubtful. Inherent in the
    assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain
    judgments and estimates relating to, among others, our
    customer’s access to capital, our customer’s
    willingness or ability to pay, general economic conditions and
    the ongoing relationship with the customer. Certain of our
    customers, several of them large public telecommunications
    carriers and utility customers, have experienced financial
    difficulties in recent years. Should any major customers
    experience difficulties or file for bankruptcy, or should
    anticipated recoveries relating to the receivables in existing
    bankruptcies and other workout situations fail to materialize,
    we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of
    current reserves. In addition, material changes in our
    customers’ revenues or cash flows could affect our ability
    to collect amounts due from them.

Income Taxes.

We follow the liability method
    of accounting for income taxes in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
    Under this method, deferred assets and liabilities are recorded
    for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
    financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and
    are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are
    expected to be in effect when the underlying assets or
    liabilities are recovered or settled.

We regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for
    deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain
    and we maintain an allowance for tax contingencies that we
    believe is adequate. The estimation of required valuation
    allowances includes estimates of future taxable income. The
    ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon
    the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
    which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider
    projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in
    making this assessment. If actual future taxable income differs
    from our estimates, we may not realize deferred tax assets to
    the extent we have estimated.

Outlook

The following statements are based on current expectations.
    These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may
    differ materially.

Many utilities across the country have regained their financial
    health and have increased spending on their transmission and
    distribution systems. As a result, we are seeing new
    construction, extensive pole change outs, line upgrades and
    maintenance projects on many systems and expect this trend to
    continue over the next several quarters.

We also anticipate increased spending as a result of the Energy
    Act, which requires the power industry to meet federal
    reliability standards for their transmission and distribution
    systems and provides further incentives to the industry to
    invest in and improve maintenance on their systems. While we
    believe the Energy Act is likely to continue to stimulate
    spending by our customers, we do not expect to begin to realize
    substantial benefits of this spending for several more quarters.

Several industry and market trends are prompting customers in
    the electric power industry to seek outsourcing partners, such
    as Quanta. These trends include an aging workforce, increased
    spending, increasing costs such as salaries and benefits, and
    labor issues.

We are also seeing improvement in the financial health of
    telecommunications customers. There are several
    telecommunications initiatives currently in discussion and
    underway by several wireline carriers and government



organizations that provide us with pockets of opportunity,
    particularly from fiber to the premises (FTTP) and fiber to the
    node (FTTN) initiatives. Such initiatives are underway by
    Verizon and AT&T, and municipalities and other government
    jurisdictions have also become active in these initiatives. We
    anticipate increased spending by wireless telecommunications
    customers on their networks, as the impact of mergers within the
    wireless industry has begun to lessen. In addition, several
    wireless companies have announced plans to increase their cell
    site deployment plans over the next year, including the
    expansion of third generation technology.

Spending in the cable television industry remains depressed.
    However, with several telecommunications companies increasing
    the pace of their FTTP and FTTN projects that will enable them
    to offer TV services via fiber to their customers, such
    initiatives could serve as a catalyst for the cable industry to
    begin a new network upgrade cycle to expand its service
    offerings in an effort to retain and attract customers. As a
    result of the sale of substantially all of the assets of
    Adelphia Communications Corporation and its affiliated companies
    (Adelphia) to Time Warner Cable and Comcast Corporation, we have
    begun to see spending by Time Warner Cable and Comcast
    Corporation as they integrate the systems acquired from Adelphia.

We continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of
    companies to broaden our customer base, expand our geographic
    area of operation and grow our portfolio of services. We believe
    that attractive acquisition candidates exist primarily as a
    result of the highly fragmented nature of the industry, the
    inability of many companies to expand and modernize due to
    capital constraints and the desire of owners of acquisition
    candidates for liquidity. We also believe that our financial
    strength and experienced management team will be attractive to
    acquisition candidates.

With the stabilization of several of our markets and our margin
    enhancement initiatives, we continue to see our gross margins
    generally improve. We continue to focus on the elements of the
    business we can control, including cost control, the margins we
    accept on projects, collecting receivables, ensuring quality
    service and rightsizing initiatives to match the markets we
    serve. These initiatives include aligning our workforce with our
    current revenue base, evaluating opportunities to reduce the
    number of field offices and evaluating our non-core assets for
    potential sale. Such initiatives, together with realignments
    associated with the integration of any future acquisitions,
    could result in future charges related to, among others,
    severance, facilities shutdown and consolidation, property
    disposal and other exit costs.

Capital expenditures in 2007 are expected to be approximately
    $60.0 million. A majority of the expenditures will be for
    operating equipment. We expect expenditures for 2007 to be
    funded substantially through internal cash flows or to the
    extent necessary, from cash on hand.

We believe that we are adequately positioned to capitalize upon
    opportunities in the industries we serve because of our proven
    full-service operating units with broad geographic reach,
    financial capability and technical expertise. Additionally, we
    believe that these industry opportunities and trends will
    increase the demand for our services; however, we cannot predict
    the actual timing or magnitude of the impact on us of these
    opportunities and trends.

Recent
    Developments

On February 26, 2007, we received notice from the Internal
    Revenue Service that it has concluded its audit of our tax
    returns for tax years 2000 through 2004. We were not required to
    make any additional payments. As a result, we are evaluating our
    allowance for tax contingencies to determine the amount by which
    the allowance should be reduced, although we currently cannot
    determine the amount of the reduction. We anticipate, however,
    that the amount of the reduction may be material to and
    positively impact our results of operations in the period in
    which the reduction is recorded, which we expect to occur in the
    first quarter of 2007. See Note 6 to our consolidated
    financial statements included in Item 8 hereof.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to certain market risks related to the impact of
    changes in interest rates and changes in the market price of our
    stock. The adverse effects of potential changes in these market
    risks are discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented
    below do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may
    have on overall economic activity nor do they consider
    additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such
    changes. Actual results may differ. Management is actively
    involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to
    develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques.
    Management does not generally use derivative financial
    instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest
    rates or commodity prices.

Interest Rate Risks.

Our exposure to market
    rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our
    convertible subordinated notes. The fair market value of our
    fixed rate convertible subordinated notes is subject to interest
    rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of our
    convertible subordinated notes. Generally, the fair market value
    of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall
    and decrease as interest rates rise. The fair market value of
    our convertible subordinated notes will also increase as the
    market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market
    price falls. The interest and market value changes affect the
    fair market value of our convertible subordinated notes but do
    not impact their carrying value. As of December 31, 2005
    and 2006, the fair value of our fixed-rate debt of
    $444.8 million and $447.0 million was approximately
    $520.1 million and $692.2 million, based upon current
    market prices.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT

Management’s
    Report on Financial Information and Procedures

The accompanying financial statements of Quanta Services, Inc.
    and its subsidiaries were prepared by management. These
    financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States, applying
    certain estimates and judgments as required.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or
    detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
    well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
    absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives
    will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the
    fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
    controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further,
    because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
    evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
    misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all
    control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
    company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
    the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
    and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or
    mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual
    acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
    management override of the controls. The design of any system of
    controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the
    likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
    any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
    potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in
    the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control
    over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal
    control over financial reporting includes those policies and
    procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
    that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
    (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based upon the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2006 to provide reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation of financial statements for external reporting
    purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal
    control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
    assurances and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears on the
    following page.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

Quanta Services, Inc.

We have completed integrated audits of Quanta Services,
    Inc.’s consolidated financial statements and of its
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our
    opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
    financial statements

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index, present fairly, in all material
    respects, the financial position of Quanta Services, Inc. and
    its subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
    statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
    includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
    amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
    the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

Internal
    control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting, which appears on the preceding page, that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
    based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by COSO. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
    assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
    conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
    in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
    audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
    obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
    reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
    evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
    control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.



A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

1.

BUSINESS
    AND ORGANIZATION:

Quanta Services, Inc. (Quanta) is a leading provider of
    specialized contracting services, offering

end-to-end

network solutions to the electric power, gas, telecommunications
    and cable television industries. Quanta’s comprehensive
    services include designing, installing, repairing and
    maintaining network infrastructure.

In the course of its operations, Quanta is subject to certain
    risk factors including, but not limited to, risks related to
    significant fluctuations in quarterly results, economic
    downturns, competition, internal growth and operating
    strategies, impact of the Energy Policy Act of 2005,
    identification, completion and integration of acquisitions, use
    of estimates and assumptions in determining financial results,
    recoverability of goodwill, being self-insured against potential
    liabilities or for claims that Quanta’s insurance carriers
    fail to pay, occupational health and safety matters, use of

percentage-of-completion

accounting, unfavorable contract terms, collectibility of
    receivables, rapid technological and structural changes in the
    industries Quanta serves, ability to provide surety bonds,
    replacing canceled or completed contracts, dependence on key
    personnel, unionized workforce, availability of qualified
    employees, management of growth, potential exposure to
    environmental liabilities, operations in international markets,
    the pursuit of work in the government arena, the requirements of
    the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, access to capital and the
    convertibility of Quanta’s convertible subordinated notes.

2.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Quanta include the
    accounts of Quanta and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
    significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
    eliminated in consolidation. Unless the context requires
    otherwise, references to Quanta include Quanta and its
    consolidated subsidiaries.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made in prior years’
    financial statements to conform to classifications used in the
    current year.

Use of
    Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management in
    determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist
    as of the date the financial statements are published and the
    reported amount of revenues and expenses recognized during the
    periods presented. Quanta reviews all significant estimates
    affecting its consolidated financial statements on a recurring
    basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior
    to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on
    Quanta’s beliefs and assumptions derived from information
    available at the time such judgments and estimates are made.
    Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are
    inherent in the preparation of financial statements. Estimates
    are primarily used in Quanta’s assessment of the allowance
    for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of
    property and equipment, fair value assumptions in analyzing
    goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, self-insured claims
    liabilities, forfeiture estimates relating to stock-based
    compensation, revenue recognition under

percentage-of-completion

accounting and provision for income taxes.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Quanta considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
    original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Short-Term
    Investments

Quanta held no short-term investments as of December 31,
    2005 or 2006; however, during 2006, Quanta invested from time to
    time in variable rate demand notes (VRDNs), which are classified
    as short-term investments available for sale when held. The
    income from VRDNs is tax-exempt to Quanta.

Current
    and Long-Term Accounts and Notes Receivable and Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

Quanta provides an allowance for doubtful accounts when
    collection of an account or note receivable is considered
    doubtful. Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for
    doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including,
    among others, the customer’s access to capital, the
    customer’s willingness or ability to pay, general economic
    conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer. Under
    certain circumstances such as foreclosures or negotiated
    settlements, Quanta may take title to the underlying assets in
    lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. As of
    December 31, 2006, Quanta had allowances for doubtful
    accounts of approximately $48.4 million. Certain of
    Quanta’s customers, several of them large public
    telecommunications carriers and utility customers, have
    experienced financial difficulties in recent years. Should any
    major customers continue to experience difficulties or file for
    bankruptcy, or should anticipated recoveries relating to
    receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations
    fail to materialize, Quanta could experience reduced cash flows
    and losses in excess of current allowances provided. In
    addition, material changes in Quanta’s customers’
    revenues or cash flows could affect its ability to collect
    amounts due from them.

The balances billed but not paid by customers pursuant to
    retainage provisions in certain contracts will be due upon
    completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer.
    Based on Quanta’s experience with similar contracts in
    recent years, the majority of the retention balances at each
    balance sheet date will be collected within the subsequent
    fiscal year. Current retainage balances as of December 31,
    2005 and 2006 were approximately $30.8 million and
    $39.0 million, and are included in accounts receivable.

Due to contractual provisions, certain balances, though the
    earnings process is complete, are not billable to customers
    until defined milestones are reached. These balances are
    considered to be unbilled receivables and are included in
    accounts receivable at year-end. At December 31, 2005 and
    2006, these balances were approximately $61.9 million and
    $92.9 million.

Included in accounts and notes receivable are amounts due from a
    customer relating to the construction of independent power
    plants. During the first quarter of 2006, the underlying assets
    which had secured these notes receivable were sold pursuant to
    liquidation proceedings and the net proceeds are being held by a
    trustee. The final collection of amounts owed to Quanta are
    subject to further legal proceedings. Quanta had allowances for
    a significant portion of these notes receivable. Also included
    in accounts and notes receivable as of December 31, 2005
    and 2006 are $4.2 million and $2.4 million in
    retainage balances with settlement dates beyond the next twelve
    months.

During 2004, Quanta sold its prepetition receivable due from
    Adelphia Communications Corporation and its affiliated companies
    (Adelphia) to a third party with $6.0 million of the
    proceeds held by the buyer pending the resolution of certain
    preferential payment claims. As of December 31, 2005, this
    balance was included in accounts and notes receivable. During
    the third quarter of 2006, the preferential payment claims were
    settled and Quanta collected the $6.0 million.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

Quanta grants credit under normal payment terms, generally
    without collateral, to its customers, which include electric
    power and gas companies, telecommunications and cable television
    system operators, governmental entities, general contractors,
    and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial
    properties located primarily in the United States. Consequently,
    Quanta is subject to potential credit risk related to changes in
    business and economic factors throughout the United States;
    however, Quanta generally has certain statutory lien rights with

respect to services provided. No customer accounted for more
    than 10% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004,
    2005 or 2006.

Inventories

Inventories consist of parts and supplies held for use in the
    ordinary course of business and are valued by Quanta at the
    lower of cost or market primarily using the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is
    computed using the straight-line method, net of estimated
    salvage values, over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
    Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the
    lesser of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of
    the asset. Depreciation and amortization expense related to
    property and equipment was approximately $59.7 million,
    $55.0 million and $49.4 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
    when incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments,
    which extend the useful lives of existing equipment, are
    capitalized and depreciated. Upon retirement or disposition of
    property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated
    depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting
    gain or loss is reflected in selling, general and administrative
    expenses.

Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount may not be realizable. If an evaluation is required, fair
    value would be determined by estimating the future undiscounted
    cash flows associated with the asset and comparing it to the
    asset’s carrying amount to determine if an impairment of
    such asset is necessary. The effect of any impairment would be
    to expense the difference between the fair value of such asset
    and its carrying value.

Debt
    Issuance Costs

As of December 31, 2005 and 2006, capitalized debt issuance
    costs related to Quanta’s credit facility and convertible
    subordinated notes were included in other assets, net and were
    being amortized into interest expense over the terms of the
    respective agreements giving rise to the debt issuance costs. As
    of December 31, 2005 and 2006, capitalized debt issuance
    costs were $19.1 million and $14.9 million with
    accumulated amortization of $10.3 million and
    $6.6 million. For the years ended December 31, 2004,
    2005 and 2006, amortization expense was $3.5 million,
    $3.6 million and $3.2 million, respectively.

Quanta incurred $4.0 million in debt issuance costs in the
    second quarter of 2006 related to its issuance of its
    3.75% convertible subordinated notes. These costs were
    capitalized and are being amortized over seven years until
    April 30, 2013, the date of the note holders’ first
    put option as discussed in Note 5. During the second
    quarter of 2006, Quanta also capitalized $2.0 million in
    connection with the amendment and restatement of its credit
    facility. Upon the amendment and restatement of Quanta’s
    credit facility, the obligations under the prior facility were
    terminated and related unamortized debt issuance costs in the
    amount of approximately $2.6 million were expensed in 2006
    and included in interest expense as discussed in Note 5. In
    addition, during the second quarter of 2006, Quanta repurchased
    a portion of its 4.0% convertible subordinated notes, and
    as a result, Quanta expensed $0.7 million in unamortized
    debt issuance costs as interest expense as discussed in
    Note 5.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangibles

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets,” material amounts of recorded goodwill attributable
    to each of Quanta’s reporting units are tested for
    impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit
    with its carrying value. Fair value is determined using a
    combination of the discounted cash flow, market multiple and
    market capitalization valuation approaches.



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Significant estimates used in the above methodologies include
    estimates of future cash flows, future short-term and long-term
    growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimates of
    market multiples for each of the reportable units. On an ongoing
    basis, absent impairment indicators, Quanta performs impairment
    tests annually during the fourth quarter. SFAS No. 142
    does not allow increases in the carrying value of reporting
    units that may result from Quanta’s impairment test,
    therefore Quanta may record goodwill impairments in the future,
    even when the aggregate fair value of Quanta’s reporting
    units and Quanta as a whole may increase.

During 2006, as part of our annual test for goodwill impairment,
    goodwill of $56.8 million was written off as a non-cash
    operating expense. The goodwill impairment is associated with a
    decrease in the expected future demand for the services of one
    of our businesses, which has historically served the cable
    television industry.

A summary of changes in Quanta’s goodwill is as follows (in
    thousands):

Quanta has an intangible asset of $2.1 million related to
    certain customer relationships. The estimated life of this
    intangible asset is eight years with amortization expense of
    $0.3 million in each of the years ended December 31,
    2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, and accumulated amortization
    as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 was approximately
    $1.1 million and $1.3 million. Estimated annual
    amortization expense for future periods is approximately
    $0.3 million through December 31, 2009.

Revenue
    Recognition

Quanta recognizes revenue when services are performed except
    when work is being performed under a fixed price contract.
    Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to
    total estimated costs for each contract. Such contracts
    generally provide that the customer accept completion of
    progress to date and compensate Quanta for services rendered,
    measured typically in terms of units installed, hours expended
    or some other measure of progress. Contract costs typically
    include all direct material, labor and subcontractor costs and
    those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as
    indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs.
    To the extent estimated costs exceed expected revenues,
    provisions for the total estimated losses on uncompleted
    contracts are made in the period in which such losses are
    determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions,
    estimated profitability and final contract settlements may
    result in revisions to costs and income and their effects are
    recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.

The current asset “Costs and estimated earnings in excess
    of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents revenues
    recognized in excess of amounts billed. The current liability
    “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on
    uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of
    revenues recognized.

Income
    Taxes

Quanta follows the liability method of accounting for income
    taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under this method,
    deferred assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are
    measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected
    to be in effect when the underlying assets or liabilities are
    recovered or settled.



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Quanta regularly evaluates valuation allowances established for
    deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain,
    and Quanta maintains an allowance for tax contingencies that
    Quanta believes is adequate. The estimation of required
    valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable
    income. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
    dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
    the periods in which those temporary differences become
    deductible. Quanta considered projected future taxable income
    and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. If actual
    future taxable income differs from estimates, Quanta may not
    realize deferred tax assets to the extent estimated.

Collective
    Bargaining Agreements

Certain of Quanta’s subsidiaries are party to various
    collective bargaining agreements with certain of their
    employees. The agreements require such subsidiaries to pay
    specified wages and provide certain benefits to their union
    employees. These agreements expire at various times.

Self-Insurance

As of December 31, 2006, Quanta was insured for
    employer’s liability and general liability claims, subject
    to a deductible of $1.0 million per occurrence, and for
    auto liability and workers’ compensation claims, subject to
    a deductible of $2.0 million per occurrence. In addition,
    beginning August 1, 2006, Quanta has been subject to an
    additional cumulative aggregate liability of up to
    $2.0 million on workers’ compensation claims in excess
    of $2.0 million per occurrence per policy year. Quanta also
    has an employee health care benefits plan for employees not
    subject to collective bargaining agreements, which is subject to
    a deductible of $250,000 per claimant per year. Losses are
    accrued based upon Quanta’s estimates of the ultimate
    liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred
    but not reported, with assistance from a third-party actuary.
    The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends
    and management believes such accruals to be adequate. As of
    December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006, the gross
    amounts accrued for self-insurance claims totaled
    $99.5 million and $117.2 million, with
    $64.4 million and $73.4 million considered to be
    long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Related
    insurance recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2005
    and December 31, 2006 were $6.3 million and
    $10.7 million, of which $3.3 million and
    $5.0 million are included in prepaid expenses and other
    current assets and $3.0 million and $5.7 million are
    included in other assets, net.

Quanta’s casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods
    from August 1, 2000 to February 28, 2003 is
    experiencing financial distress but is currently paying valid
    claims. In the event that this insurer’s financial
    situation deteriorates, Quanta may be required to pay certain
    obligations that otherwise would have been paid by this insurer.
    Quanta estimates that the total future claim amount that this
    insurer is currently obligated to pay on Quanta’s behalf
    for the above-mentioned policy periods is approximately
    $6.2 million, and Quanta has recorded a receivable and
    corresponding liability for such amount as of December 31,
    2006. However, Quanta’s estimate of the potential range of
    these future claim amounts is between $3.6 million and
    $8.5 million. The actual amounts ultimately paid by Quanta
    related to these claims, if any, may vary materially from the
    above range and could be impacted by further claims development
    and the extent to which the insurer could not honor its
    obligations. Quanta continues to monitor the financial situation
    of this insurer and analyze any alternative actions that could
    be pursued. In any event, Quanta does not expect any failure by
    this insurer to honor its obligations to Quanta, or any
    alternative actions Quanta may pursue, to have a material
    adverse impact on Quanta’s financial condition; however,
    the impact could be material to Quanta’s results of
    operations or cash flows in a given period.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    receivable, accounts payable, borrowings under the credit
    facility and notes payable to various financial institutions
    approximate fair value. The fair value of the convertible
    subordinated notes is estimated based on quoted secondary market
    prices for these notes as of year-end. At December 31, 2005
    and 2006, the fair value of the aggregate principal amount
    outstanding of Quanta’s 4.0%



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

convertible subordinated notes of $172.5 million and
    $33.3 million was approximately $163.0 million and
    $32.8 million. At December 31, 2005 and 2006, the fair
    value of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of
    Quanta’s 4.5% convertible subordinated notes of
    $270.0 million was approximately $354.7 million and
    $496.1 million. At December 31, 2006 the fair value of
    the aggregate principal amount outstanding of Quanta’s
    3.75% convertible subordinated notes of $143.8 million
    was approximately $163.3 million.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Prior to January 1, 2006, Quanta accounted for its
    stock-based compensation awards under APB Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” Under this
    accounting method, no compensation expense was recognized in the
    consolidated statements of operations if no intrinsic value of
    the stock-based compensation award existed at the date of grant.
    SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Based
    Compensation,” which encouraged companies to account for
    stock-based compensation awards based on the fair value of the
    awards at the date they were granted, required disclosure as to
    what net income and earnings per share would have been had
    SFAS No. 123 been followed. Had compensation expense
    for transactions under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended
    and restated March 13, 2003) (the 2001 Plan) and the
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which was terminated in 2005, been
    determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, Quanta’s
    net income and earnings per share for the years ended
    December 31, 2004 and 2005 would have been reduced to the
    following as adjusted amounts (in thousands, except per share

Effective January 1, 2006, Quanta adopted
    SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
    Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R)), using the modified
    prospective method of adoption, which requires recognition of
    compensation expense for all stock-based compensation beginning
    on the effective date. Under this method of accounting,
    compensation cost for stock-based compensation awards is based
    on the fair value of the awards granted, net of estimated
    forfeitures, at the date of grant. The resulting compensation
    costs are recognized over the service period of each award as
    discussed in Note 8. In accordance with the modified
    prospective method of adoption, Quanta has not adjusted
    consolidated financial statements for prior periods.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for
    Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments — An Amendment of
    FASB Statements No. 133 and 140.”
    SFAS No. 155 provides entities with relief from having
    to separately determine the fair value of an embedded derivative
    that would otherwise be required to be bifurcated from its host
    contract in accordance with SFAS No. 133.
    SFAS No. 155 allows an entity to make an irrevocable
    election to measure such a hybrid financial instrument at fair
    value in its



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

entirety, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.
    SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial
    instruments acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement event
    occurring after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal
    year that begins after September 15, 2006. Quanta does not
    believe that its adoption of SFAS No. 155 on
    January 1, 2007 will have a material impact on
    Quanta’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
    interpretation of SFAS 109, Accounting for Income
    Taxes” (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a
    comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure,
    present and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax
    positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under
    FIN 48, tax positions may be recognized in the financial
    statements when it is more likely than not the position will be
    sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. The amount
    recognized for such tax positions is measured as the largest
    amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of
    being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also
    revises disclosure requirements to include an annual tabular
    rollforward of unrecognized tax benefits. The provisions of this
    interpretation are required to be adopted for fiscal periods
    beginning after December 15, 2006. Quanta will be required
    to apply the provisions of FIN 48 to all tax positions upon
    initial adoption with any cumulative effect adjustment to be
    recognized as an adjustment to accumulated deficit. While Quanta
    has not completed its final evaluation of the impact of its
    January 1, 2007 adoption of FIN 48, Quanta does not
    expect such adoption to have a material impact on its financial
    statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157
    defines fair value, establishes methods used to measure fair
    value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
    periods. Quanta is currently analyzing the provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 and determining how it will affect its
    accounting policies and procedures and has not yet made a
    determination of the impact that its January 1, 2008
    adoption will have on its consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
    “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements” (SAB 108), which provides guidance on the
    consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in
    quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a
    materiality assessment. SAB 108 requires that the
    materiality of the effect of a misstated amount be evaluated on
    each financial statement and the related financial statement
    disclosures, and that the materiality evaluation be based on
    quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 is effective
    for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. Quanta
    adopted SAB 108 on December 31, 2006, and this
    guidance did not have a material impact on Quanta’s
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115”. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to
    choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments and
    certain other items that are not currently required to be
    measured at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for
    which the fair value option has been elected are reported in
    earnings. SFAS No. 159 does not affect any existing
    accounting literature that requires certain assets and
    liabilities to be carried at fair value. SFAS No. 159
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. Quanta will adopt SFAS No. 159 on
    January 1, 2008, but has not yet determined the impact, if
    any, on its consolidated financial statements.

PER SHARE
    INFORMATION:

Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period,
    and diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed using the
    weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
    period adjusted for all potentially dilutive common stock
    equivalents, except in cases where the effect of the common
    stock equivalent would be antidilutive. The weighted average

    options for approximately 0.7 million, 0.2 million and
    0.2 million shares, respectively, were excluded from the
    computation of diluted earnings per share because the
    options’ exercise prices were greater than the average
    market price of Quanta’s common stock. For the year ended
    December 31, 2004, 0.7 million shares of non-vested
    restricted stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted
    earnings per share as the impact would have been antidilutive.
    For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, the
    effect of assuming conversion of Quanta’s convertible
    subordinated notes would be antidilutive and they were therefore
    excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

Credit
    Facilities

As of December 31, 2006, Quanta had an amended and restated
    credit facility with various lenders which provides for a
    $300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility
    maturing on June 12, 2011 (the credit facility). The credit
    facility amended and restated Quanta’s prior credit
    facility described below. Subject to the conditions specified in
    the credit facility, Quanta has the option to increase the
    revolving commitments under the credit facility by up to an
    additional $125.0 million from time to time upon receipt of
    additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Borrowings
    under the credit facility are to be used for working capital,
    capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The
    entire amount of the credit facility is available for the
    issuance of letters of credit.

As of December 31, 2006, Quanta had approximately
    $140.4 million of letters of credit issued under the credit
    facility and no outstanding revolving loans. The remaining
    $159.6 million was available for revolving loans or issuing
    new letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the credit
    facility bear interest, at Quanta’s option, at a rate equal
    to either (a) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the credit
    facility) plus 1.25% to 1.875%, as determined by the ratio of
    Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as
    defined in the credit agreement), or (b) the base rate (as
    described below) plus 0.25% to 0.875%, as determined by the
    ratio of Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA.
    Letters of credit issued under the credit facility are subject
    to a letter of credit fee of 1.25% to 1.875%, based on the ratio
    of Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA.
    Quanta is also subject to a commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.35%,
    based on the ratio of its total funded debt to consolidated
    EBITDA, on any unused availability under the credit facility.
    The base rate equals the higher of (i) the Federal Funds
    Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 1/2 of 1% and
    (ii) the bank’s prime rate.

The credit facility contains certain covenants, including
    covenants with respect to maximum funded debt to consolidated
    EBITDA, maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA, minimum
    interest coverage and minimum consolidated net worth, in each
    case as specified in the credit facility. For purposes of
    calculating the maximum funded debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio
    and the maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio,
    Quanta’s maximum funded debt and maximum senior debt are
    reduced by all cash and cash equivalents (as defined in the
    credit facility) held by Quanta in excess of $25.0 million.
    As of December 31, 2006, Quanta was in compliance with all
    of its covenants. The credit facility limits certain
    acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, capital expenditures,
    asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to
    certain exceptions, prohibits liens on material assets. The
    credit facility also limits the payment of dividends and stock
    repurchase programs in any fiscal year to an annual aggregate
    amount of up to 25% of Quanta’s consolidated net income
    (plus the amount of non-cash charges



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

that reduced such consolidated net income) for the prior fiscal
    year. The credit facility does not limit dividend payments or
    other distributions payable solely in capital stock. The credit
    facility provides for customary events of default and carries
    cross-default provisions with all of Quanta’s existing
    subordinated notes, its continuing indemnity and security
    agreement with its surety and all of its other debt instruments
    exceeding $10.0 million in borrowings. If an event of
    default (as defined in the credit facility) occurs and is
    continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
    in the credit facility, amounts outstanding under the credit
    facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared
    immediately due and payable.

The credit facility is secured by a pledge of all of the capital
    stock of Quanta’s U.S. subsidiaries, 65% of the
    capital stock of its foreign subsidiaries and substantially all
    of Quanta’s assets. Quanta’s U.S. subsidiaries
    guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the credit
    facility. Quanta’s obligations under the credit facility
    constitute designated senior indebtedness under its 3.75%, 4.0%
    and 4.5% convertible subordinated notes.

As of December 31, 2005, Quanta had a $182.0 million
    credit facility with various lenders (the prior facility). The
    prior facility consisted of a $147.0 million letter of
    credit facility maturing on June 19, 2008 and a
    $35.0 million revolving credit facility maturing on
    December 19, 2007. The letter of credit facility provided
    for letters of credit and term loans, and the revolving credit
    facility provided for revolving loans and letters of credit. The
    prior facility was amended during 2006 to permit, among other
    things, Quanta’s issuance of its 3.75% convertible
    subordinated notes and Quanta’s cash tender offer for its
    4.0% convertible subordinated notes, each as described
    below. Upon the amendment and restatement of Quanta’s
    credit facility, described above, the obligations under the
    prior facility were terminated, and related unamortized debt
    issuance costs in the amount of approximately $2.6 million
    were expensed and included in interest expense in 2006. As of
    December 31, 2005, Quanta had approximately
    $142.6 million of letters of credit outstanding under the
    prior facility and $7.5 million outstanding under the prior
    facility as a term loan. The weighted average interest rate for
    the year ended December 31, 2005 associated with amounts
    outstanding under the term loan was 6.41%.

4.0% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

As of December 31, 2006, Quanta had $33.3 million
    aggregate principal amount of 4.0% convertible subordinated
    notes due 2007 (4.0% Notes) outstanding, which was
    classified as a current obligation as these 4.0% Notes will
    mature within the next twelve months. The 4.0% Notes are
    convertible into shares of Quanta’s common stock at a price
    of $54.53 per share, subject to adjustment as a result of
    certain events. The sale of the notes and the shares issuable
    upon conversion thereof was registered by Quanta in a
    registration statement filed with the SEC. The 4.0% Notes
    require semi-annual interest payments on July 1 and
    December 31 until the notes mature on July 1, 2007.
    Quanta has the option to redeem some or all of the
    4.0% Notes at specified redemption prices, together with
    accrued and unpaid interest. If certain fundamental changes
    occur, as described in the indenture under which Quanta issued
    the 4.0% Notes, holders of the 4.0% Notes may require
    Quanta to purchase all or part of the notes at a purchase price
    equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
    interest. During 2006, Quanta conducted a cash tender offer for
    all of the 4.0% Notes, which resulted in the repurchase of
    $139.2 million outstanding principal amount of the
    4.0% Notes. As a result of the repurchase of a portion of
    the 4.0% Notes, Quanta recorded a gain on early
    extinguishment of debt of approximately $2.1 million during
    2006, which was partially offset by costs associated with the
    tender offer of approximately $0.5 million. In addition,
    approximately $0.7 million in related unamortized debt
    issuance costs associated with the retirement of a portion of
    the repurchased 4.0% Notes was expensed and included in
    interest expense in 2006.

4.5% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

As of December 31, 2006, Quanta had $270.0 million
    aggregate principal amount of 4.5% convertible subordinated
    notes due 2023 (4.5% Notes) outstanding. The resale of the
    notes and the shares issuable upon conversion thereof was
    registered for the benefit of the holders in a shelf
    registration statement filed with the SEC.



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The 4.5% Notes require semi-annual interest payments on
    April 1 and October 1, until the notes mature on
    October 1, 2023.

The 4.5% Notes are convertible into shares of Quanta’s
    common stock based on an initial conversion rate of
    89.7989 shares of Quanta’s common stock per $1,000
    principal amount of 4.5% Notes (which is equal to an
    initial conversion price of approximately $11.14 per
    share), subject to adjustment as a result of certain events. The
    4.5% Notes are convertible by the holder (i) during
    any fiscal quarter if the last reported sale price of
    Quanta’s common stock is greater than or equal to 120% of
    the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the period
    of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the first trading day
    of such fiscal quarter, (ii) during the five business day
    period after any five consecutive trading day period in which
    the trading price per note for each day of that period was less
    than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of
    Quanta’s common stock and the conversion rate,
    (iii) upon Quanta calling the notes for redemption or
    (iv) upon the occurrence of specified corporate
    transactions. If the notes become convertible under any of these
    circumstances, Quanta has the option to deliver cash, shares of
    Quanta’s common stock or a combination thereof, with the
    amount of cash determined in accordance with the terms of the
    indenture under which the notes were issued. During each quarter
    of 2006, the market price condition described in clause (i)
    above was satisfied, and the notes were convertible at the
    option of the holder, although no holders exercised their right
    to convert. The notes are presently convertible at the option of
    each holder, and the conversion period will expire on
    March 31, 2007, but may resume upon the satisfaction of the
    market condition or other conditions in future periods.

Beginning October 8, 2008, Quanta may redeem for cash some
    or all of the 4.5% Notes at the principal amount thereof
    plus accrued and unpaid interest. The holders of the
    4.5% Notes may require Quanta to repurchase all or some of
    their notes at the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
    unpaid interest on October 1, 2008, 2013 or 2018, or upon
    the occurrence of a fundamental change, as defined by the
    indenture under which we issued the notes. Quanta must pay any
    required repurchases on October 1, 2008 in cash. For all
    other required repurchases, Quanta has the option to deliver
    cash, shares of its common stock or a combination thereof to
    satisfy its repurchase obligation. If Quanta were to satisfy any
    required repurchase obligation with shares of its common stock,
    the number of shares delivered will equal the dollar amount to
    be paid in common stock divided by 98.5% of the market price of
    Quanta’s common stock, as defined by the indenture. The
    right to settle for shares of common stock can be surrendered by
    Quanta. The 4.5% Notes carry cross-default provisions with
    Quanta’s other debt instruments exceeding
    $10.0 million in borrowings, which includes Quanta’s
    existing credit facility.

3.75% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

As of December 31, 2006, Quanta had $143.8 million
    aggregate principal amount of 3.75% convertible
    subordinated notes due 2026 (3.75% Notes) outstanding. The
    resale of the notes and the shares issuable upon conversion
    thereof was registered for the benefit of the holders in a shelf
    registration statement filed with the SEC. The 3.75% Notes
    mature on April 30, 2026 and bear interest at the annual
    rate of 3.75%, payable semi-annually on April 30 and
    October 30, until maturity.

The 3.75% Notes are convertible into Quanta’s common
    stock, based on an initial conversion rate of
    44.6229 shares of Quanta’s common stock per $1,000
    principal amount of 3.75% Notes (which is equal to an
    initial conversion price of approximately $22.41 per
    share), subject to adjustment as a result of certain events. The
    3.75% Notes are convertible by the holder (i) during
    any fiscal quarter if the closing price of Quanta’s common
    stock is greater than 130% of the conversion price for at least
    20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days
    ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
    fiscal quarter, (ii) upon Quanta calling the
    3.75% Notes for redemption, (iii) upon the occurrence
    of specified distributions to holders of Quanta’s common
    stock or specified corporate transactions or (iv) at any
    time on or after March 1, 2026 until the business day
    immediately preceding the maturity date of the 3.75% Notes.
    If the 3.75% Notes become convertible under any of these
    circumstances, Quanta has the option to deliver cash, shares of
    Quanta’s common stock or a combination thereof, with the
    amount of cash determined in accordance with the terms of the
    indenture under which the notes



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

were issued. The holders of the 3.75% Notes who convert
    their notes in connection with certain change in control
    transactions, as defined in the indenture, may be entitled to a
    make whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion
    rate. In the event of a change in control, in lieu of paying
    holders a make whole premium, if applicable, Quanta may elect,
    in some circumstances, to adjust the conversion rate and related
    conversion obligations so that the 3.75% Notes are
    convertible into shares of the acquiring or surviving company.

Beginning on April 30, 2010 until April 30, 2013,
    Quanta may redeem for cash all or part of the 3.75% Notes
    at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
    and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Quanta’s
    common stock is equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion
    price then in effect for the 3.75% Notes for at least 20
    trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on
    the trading day immediately prior to the date of mailing of the
    notice of redemption. In addition, Quanta may redeem for cash
    all or part of the 3.75% Notes at any time on or after
    April 30, 2010 at certain redemption prices, plus accrued
    and unpaid interest. Beginning with the six-month interest
    period commencing on April 30, 2010, and for each six-month
    interest period thereafter, Quanta will be required to pay
    contingent interest on any outstanding 3.75% Notes during
    the applicable interest period if the average trading price of
    the 3.75% Notes reaches a specified threshold. The
    contingent interest payable within any applicable interest
    period will equal an annual rate of 0.25% of the average trading
    price of the 3.75% Notes during a five trading day
    reference period.

The holders of the 3.75% Notes may require Quanta to
    repurchase all or a part of the notes in cash on each of
    April 30, 2013, April 30, 2016 and April 30,
    2021, and in the event of a change in control of Quanta, as
    defined in the indenture, at a purchase price equal to 100% of
    the principal amount of the 3.75% Notes plus accrued and
    unpaid interest. The 3.75% Notes carry cross-default
    provisions with Quanta’s other debt instruments exceeding
    $20.0 million in borrowings, which includes Quanta’s
    existing credit facility.

The current deferred income tax assets, net of current deferred
    income tax liabilities, are included in prepaid expenses and
    other current assets.

At December 31, 2006, Quanta had state net operating loss
    carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately
    $12.6 million. These carryforwards will expire as follows:
    2007, $0.4 million; 2008, $1.0 million; 2009,
    $0.8 million; 2010, $0.7 million; 2011,
    $0.4 million; and $9.3 million thereafter.

In assessing the value of deferred tax assets, Quanta considers
    whether it was more likely than not that some or all of the
    deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate
    realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
    generation of future taxable income during the periods in which
    those temporary differences become deductible. Quanta considers
    the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected
    future taxable income and tax planning



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

strategies in making this assessment. Based upon these
    considerations, Quanta provides a valuation allowance to reduce
    the carrying value of certain of its deferred tax assets to
    their net expected realizable value.

Quanta has received refund claims in the amounts of
    $38.1 million in 2003 and $30.2 million in 2004 from
    the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) due to the carryback of
    taxable losses reported on Quanta’s 2002 and 2003 income
    tax returns. The IRS is required by law to review Quanta’s
    claims for refund. As a result, Quanta was under audit for tax
    years 2000 through 2004. On February 26, 2007, Quanta
    received notice from the IRS that it has concluded its audit of
    Quanta’s income tax returns for these tax years. Quanta was
    not required to make any additional payments. To provide for
    potential tax exposures, Quanta maintains an allowance for tax
    contingencies, which management believes is adequate. As a
    result of the notification from the IRS, Quanta is evaluating
    our allowance for tax contingencies to determine the amount by
    which the allowance should be reduced, although Quanta currently
    cannot determine the amount of the reduction.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2006, the amounts accrued for
    tax contingencies totaled $67.5 million and
    $76.1 million, with $46.8 million in 2005 and
    $55.4 million in 2006, considered to be long-term and
    included in other non-current liabilities. The results of future
    audit assessments, if any, could have a material effect on
    Quanta’s cash flows as these audits are completed. However,
    management does not believe that any of these matters will have
    a material adverse effect on Quanta’s consolidated results
    of operations.

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY:

Stockholder
    Rights Plan

Quanta has adopted a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which
    one right to acquire Series D Junior Preferred Stock, as
    described below, has been issued and attached to each
    outstanding share of common stock. The following description of
    Quanta’s stockholder rights plan and the certificate of
    designations setting forth the terms and conditions of the
    Series D Junior Preferred Stock are intended as summaries
    only and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
    form of stockholder rights plan and certificate of designations
    to the certificate of incorporation filed with the SEC.

Until a distribution date occurs, the rights can be transferred
    only with the common stock. On the occurrence of a distribution
    date, the rights will separate from the common stock and become
    exercisable as described below.

A “distribution date” will occur upon the
    earlier of:

•

the tenth day after a public announcement that a person or group
    of affiliated or associated persons other than Quanta and
    certain exempt persons (an “acquiring person”) has
    acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the total voting
    rights of the then outstanding shares of Quanta’s common
    stock; or

•

the tenth business day following the commencement of a tender or
    exchange offer that would result in such person or group
    becoming an acquiring person.

Following the distribution date, holders of rights will be
    entitled to purchase from Quanta one one-thousandth (1/1000th)
    of a share of Series D Junior Preferred Stock at a purchase
    price of $153.33, subject to adjustment.

In the event that any person or group becomes an acquiring
    person, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a
    right, other than rights beneficially owned by the acquiring
    person, will thereafter have the right to receive upon payment
    of the purchase price, that number of shares of common stock
    having a market value equal to the result obtained by
    (A) multiplying the then current purchase price by the
    number of one one-thousandths of a share of Series D Junior
    Preferred Stock for which the right is then exercisable, and
    dividing that product by (B) 50% of the current per share
    market price of our shares of common stock on the date of such
    occurrence. If, following the date of a public announcement that
    an acquiring person has become such, (1) Quanta is acquired
    in a merger or



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

other business combination transaction and Quanta is not the
    surviving corporation, (2) any person consolidates or
    merges with Quanta and all or part of the common stock is
    converted or exchanged for securities, cash or property of any
    other person, or (3) 50% or more of Quanta’s assets or
    earning power is sold or transferred, then the rights will
    “flip-over.” At that time, each right will entitle its
    holder to purchase, for the purchase price, a number of shares
    of common stock of the surviving entity in any such merger,
    consolidation or other business combination or the purchaser in
    any such sale or transfer with a market value equal to the
    result obtained by (X) multiplying the then current
    purchase price by the number of one one-thousandths of a share
    of Series D Junior Preferred Stock for which the right is
    then exercisable, and dividing that product by (Y) 50% of
    the current per share market price of the shares of common stock
    of the surviving entity on the date of consummation of such
    consolidation, merger, sale or transfer.

The rights will expire on March 8, 2010, unless Quanta
    terminates them before that time. A holder of a right will not
    have any rights as a stockholder of Quanta, including the right
    to vote or to receive dividends, until a right is exercised.

Limited
    Vote Common Stock

The shares of Limited Vote Common Stock have rights similar
    to shares of common stock, except that such shares are entitled
    to elect one member of the Board of Directors and are entitled
    to one-tenth of one vote for each share held on all other
    matters. Each share of Limited Vote Common Stock will
    convert into common stock upon disposition by the holder of such
    shares in accordance with the transfer restrictions applicable
    to such shares. In 2004, 55,970 shares and in 2006,
    95,975 shares of Limited Vote Common Stock were
    converted to common stock. No shares of Limited Vote Common
    Stock were converted to common stock during the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

Treasury
    Stock

Pursuant to the 2001 Plan, employees may elect to satisfy their
    tax withholding obligations upon vesting of restricted stock by
    having Quanta make such tax payments and withhold a number of
    vested shares having a value on the date of vesting equal to
    their tax withholding obligation. As a result of such employee
    elections, Quanta withheld 342,261 shares in 2004 with a
    total market value of $2.9 million, 350,037 shares in
    2005 with a total market value of $2.8 million and
    368,179 shares in 2006 with a total market value of
    $5.1 million, in each case from previously granted
    restricted stock for settlement of employee tax liabilities
    pursuant to the 2001 Plan discussed in Note 8, and these
    shares were accounted for as treasury stock.

Deferred
    Compensation

Pursuant to the 2001 Plan discussed in Note 8, Quanta
    issues restricted stock at the fair market value of the common
    stock as of the date of issuance. The shares of restricted stock
    issued pursuant to the 2001 Plan are subject to forfeiture,
    restrictions on transfer and certain other conditions until they
    vest, which generally occurs over three years in equal annual
    installments. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), upon
    issuance of the restricted stock, an unamortized compensation
    expense equivalent to the market value of the shares on the date
    of grant was charged to stockholders’ equity and amortized
    over the restriction period as non-cash compensation expense,
    typically three years. If shares of restricted stock were
    canceled during a given period, any remaining unamortized
    deferred compensation expense related to the issuance and any
    non-cash compensation expense previously recognized on the
    cancelled shares was reversed against additional paid-in
    capital. In connection with the adoption of SFAS 123(R),
    deferred compensation is no longer recorded and the amount
    recorded as of December 31, 2005, $6.4 million, was
    reversed against additional paid-in capital in 2006.

LONG-TERM
    INCENTIVE PLANS:

Stock
    Incentive Plan

In December 1997, the Board of Directors adopted, and the
    stockholders of Quanta approved, the 1997 Stock Option Plan. The
    1997 Stock Option Plan was amended from time to time and, in May
    2001, was amended and renamed the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan. The
    2001 Plan was amended and restated on March 13, 2003, which
    amendment and restatement, among other things, incorporated all
    prior amendments. The purpose of the plan is to provide
    directors, key employees, officers and certain consultants and
    advisors with additional incentives by increasing their
    proprietary interest in Quanta.

The 2001 Plan provides for the award of incentive stock options
    (ISOs) as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), nonqualified stock options
    and restricted stock (collectively, the Awards). The aggregate
    number of shares of common stock with respect to which options
    or restricted stock may be awarded may not exceed the greater of
    3,571,275 shares or 12% of the aggregate outstanding shares
    of common stock and Limited Vote Common Stock. The amount
    of ISOs that may be awarded under the 2001 Plan is limited to
    3,571,275 shares. The 2001 Plan is administered by the
    Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The
    Compensation Committee has, subject to applicable regulation and
    the terms of the 2001 Plan, the authority to grant Awards under
    the 2001 Plan, to construe and interpret the 2001 Plan and to
    make all other determinations and take any and all actions
    necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2001 Plan.
    Pursuant to the terms of the 2001 Plan, Quanta’s Chief
    Executive Officer has the authority to award to individuals who
    are not officers (i) non-qualified stock options, provided
    that the aggregate number of shares of common stock issuable
    upon the exercise of the options awarded in any one calendar
    quarter does not exceed 100,000 shares and provided
    further, that the aggregate number of shares of common stock
    issuable upon the exercise of the options awardable to any
    individual in any one calendar quarter does not exceed
    20,000 shares and (ii) shares of restricted stock,
    provided that the aggregate value of the awards of restricted
    stock granted in any one calendar quarter does not exceed
    $250,000 determined based on the fair market value of the common
    stock at the time of the grants and provided further, that the
    aggregate value of the awards of restricted stock granted to any
    individual in any one calendar quarter does not exceed $25,000
    determined based on the fair market value of the common stock at
    the time of the grants.

All of Quanta’s employees (including officers),
    non-employee directors and certain consultants and advisors are
    eligible to receive Awards under the 2001 Plan, but only
    employees of Quanta are eligible to receive ISOs. Awards will be
    exercisable during the period specified in each Award agreement
    and will generally become exercisable in installments pursuant
    to a vesting schedule designated by the Compensation Committee.
    Unless specifically provided otherwise in the Award agreement,
    Awards become immediately vested and exercisable in the event of
    a “change in control” (as defined in the 2001 Plan) of
    Quanta. No option will remain exercisable later than ten years
    after the date of grant (or five years in the case of ISOs
    granted to employees owning more than 10% of the voting capital
    stock).

Stock
    Options

Beginning January 1, 2006, Quanta accounted for its stock
    options in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R); however,
    the effect of expensing the fair value of the stock options did
    not have a material impact on Quanta’s financial position
    or results or operations, as the number of unvested stock
    options remaining at the time of the adoption of SFAS 123(R)
    was not significant. No stock options have been granted by
    Quanta since November 2002. As of December 31, 2006, the
    number of options outstanding, all of which have vested, was not
    material. Certain disclosures required under
    SFAS No. 123(R) have been omitted due to immateriality.

The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from
    option exercises totaled approximately $0.4 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. This tax benefit is reported
    as a cash inflow from financing activities and an adjustment to
    net income to derive cash flow from operations within the
    statement of cash flows for the year ended



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2006, as required by
    SFAS No. 123(R). As stated above, prior periods have
    not been adjusted in accordance with the modified prospective
    method of application.

Restricted
    Stock

During 2003, Quanta began using restricted stock for its various
    stock incentive programs. Pursuant to the 2001 Plan, Quanta
    issues restricted stock at the fair market value of the common
    stock as of the date of issuance. The shares of restricted stock
    issued pursuant to the 2001 Plan are subject to forfeiture,
    restrictions on transfer and certain other conditions until they
    vest, which generally occurs over three years in equal annual
    installments. During the restriction period, the plan
    participants are entitled to vote and receive dividends on such
    shares.

During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006,
    Quanta granted 0.8 million, 0.7 million and
    0.7 million shares of restricted stock with a weighted
    average grant price of $7.02, $7.58 and $13.98, respectively.
    During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006,
    1.1 million, 1.1 million and 1.2 million shares
    vested with an approximate fair value at the time of vesting of
    $8.9 million, $8.9 million and $16.9 million,
    respectively. A summary of Quanta’s restricted stock
    activity for the year ended December 31, 2006 is as follows
    (in thousands, except fair value amounts):

Compensation expense is measured based on the fair value of the
    restricted stock and is recognized on a straight-line basis over
    the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. The
    fair value of the restricted stock is determined based on the
    number of shares granted and the closing price of Quanta’s
    common stock on the date of grant. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires estimating future forfeitures
    in determining the period expense, rather than recording
    forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. Quanta uses
    historical data to estimate the forfeiture rate. The effect of
    estimating forfeitures in determining the period expense, rather
    than recording forfeitures as they actually occurred, was not
    significant. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005
    and 2006, Quanta recorded non-cash compensation expense with
    respect to restricted stock in the amount of $4.6 million,
    $5.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively, and a
    related income tax benefit of $1.8 million,
    $1.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively.

Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock
    granted to both employees and non-employees was
    $7.9 million as of December 31, 2006. The unrecognized
    compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 1.6 years. The estimate of
    unrecognized compensation cost uses the expected forfeiture
    rate; however, the estimate may not necessarily represent the
    value that will ultimately be realized as compensation expense.
    As of December 31, 2005, unrecognized compensation expense
    related to unvested shares of restricted stock granted to
    employees was recorded as deferred compensation in
    stockholders’ equity. As part of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), $6.4 million of deferred
    compensation was reversed against additional paid-in capital
    during the first quarter of 2006.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

An Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP) was adopted by the
    Board of Directors of Quanta and was approved by the
    stockholders of Quanta in May 1999. The ESPP was terminated
    during 2005. The purpose of the



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

ESPP was to provide an incentive for employees of Quanta and any
    Participating Company (as defined in the ESPP) to acquire or
    increase a proprietary interest in Quanta through the purchase
    of shares of Quanta’s common stock. The ESPP was intended
    to qualify as an “Employee Stock Purchase Plan” under
    Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended (the Code). The provisions of the ESPP were construed in
    a manner consistent with the requirements of that section of the
    Code. The ESPP was administered by a committee, appointed from
    time to time, by the Board of Directors. The ESPP was not
    subject to any of the provisions of the Employee Retirement
    Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. During 2004 and 2005,
    Quanta issued a total of 537,479 shares and 674,759 shares,
    pursuant to the ESPP.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS:

Union’s
    Multi-Employer Pension Plans

In connection with its collective bargaining agreements with
    various unions, Quanta participates with other companies in the
    unions’ multi-employer pension plans. These plans cover all
    of Quanta’s employees who are members of such unions. The
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by
    the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes
    certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors to a
    multi-employer plan in the event of the employer’s
    withdrawal from, or upon termination of, such plan. Quanta has
    no plans to withdraw from these plans. The plans do not maintain
    information on the net assets and actuarial present value of the
    plans’ unfunded vested benefits allocable to Quanta, and
    the amounts, if any, for which Quanta may be contingently
    liable, are not ascertainable at this time. Contributions to all
    union multi-employer pension plans by Quanta were approximately
    $46.2 million, $50.3 million and $53.1 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006,
    respectively.

401(k)
    Plan

Effective February 1, 1999, Quanta adopted a 401(k) plan
    pursuant to which employees who are not provided retirement
    benefits through a collective bargaining agreement may make
    contributions through a payroll deduction. Quanta will make a
    matching cash contribution of 100% of each employee’s
    contribution up to 3% of that employee’s salary and 50% of
    each employee’s contribution between 3% and 6% of such
    employee’s salary, up to the maximum amount permitted by
    law. Prior to joining Quanta’s 401(k) plan, certain
    subsidiaries of Quanta provided various defined contribution
    plans to their employees. Contributions to all non-union defined
    contribution plans by Quanta were approximately
    $5.5 million, $5.3 million and $5.6 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006,
    respectively.

RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

Certain of Quanta’s subsidiaries have entered into related
    party lease arrangements for operational facilities, typically
    with prior owners of certain acquired businesses. These lease
    agreements generally have terms of up to five years. Related
    party lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2004,
    2005 and 2006 was approximately $3.0 million,
    $3.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES:

Leases

Quanta leases certain land, buildings and equipment under
    non-cancelable lease agreements, including related party leases
    as discussed in Note 10. The terms of these agreements vary
    from lease to lease, including some with renewal options and
    escalation clauses. The following schedule shows the future
    minimum lease payments under these leases as of
    December 31, 2006 (in thousands):

Rent expense related to operating leases was approximately
    $51.8 million, $64.5 million and $78.3 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006,
    respectively.

Quanta has guaranteed the residual value on certain of its
    equipment operating leases. Quanta guarantees the difference
    between this residual value and the fair market value of the
    underlying asset at the date of termination of the leases. At
    December 31, 2006, the maximum guaranteed residual value
    was approximately $108.4 million. Quanta believes that no
    significant payments will be made as a result of the difference
    between the fair market value of the leased equipment and the
    guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no assurance
    that future significant payments will not be required.

Litigation

Quanta is from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims
    and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These actions typically seek, among other things,
    compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract

and/or

property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
    losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all
    such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, Quanta records reserves
    when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
    amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Quanta does not
    believe that any of these proceedings, separately or in the
    aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse effect
    on Quanta’s financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Performance
    Bonds

In certain circumstances, Quanta is required to provide
    performance bonds in connection with its contractual
    commitments. Quanta has indemnified the sureties for any
    expenses paid out under these performance bonds. As of
    December 31, 2006, the total amount of outstanding
    performance bonds was approximately $650.7 million.

Employment
    Agreements

Quanta has entered into various employment agreements with
    certain executives which provide for compensation and certain
    other benefits and for severance payments under certain
    circumstances. In addition, certain employment agreements
    contain clauses that become effective upon a change of control
    of Quanta. Upon the



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

occurrence of any of the defined events in the various
    employment agreements, Quanta will pay certain amounts to the
    employee, which vary with the level of the employee’s
    responsibility.

Indemnities

In connection with Quanta’s previous acquisitions, Quanta
    has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities
    that those parties might incur in the future. These indemnities
    usually are contingent upon the other party incurring
    liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of
    December 31, 2006, Quanta is not aware of circumstances
    that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for
    material amounts in connection with these transactions.

    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we
    evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to

Rule 13a-15(b)

of the Exchange Act. This evaluation was carried out under the
    supervision and with the participation of our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer. Based on this evaluation, these officers have concluded
    that, as of December 31, 2006, our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance of
    achieving their objectives.

Evaluation
    of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management’s Annual Report on internal control over
    financial reporting can be found in Item 8 of this Annual
    Report under the heading “Report of Management” and is
    incorporated herein by reference. The report of
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, on the financial statements, management’s
    assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting and its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, can also be found in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report under the heading “Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” and is
    incorporated herein by reference.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2006, that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

Design
    and Operation of Control Systems

Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting
    will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control
    system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
    only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control
    system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control
    system must reflect the fact that there are resource
    constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
    relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent
    limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
    can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
    or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances
    of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These
    inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
    decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because
    of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can be circumvented by
    the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
    people, or by management override of the controls. The design of
    any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions
    about the



likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
    any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
    potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in
    the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
