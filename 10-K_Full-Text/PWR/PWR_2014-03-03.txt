ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

For the Year Ended December 31, 2013

INDEX



PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

General

Quanta Services, Inc. (Quanta) is a leading provider of specialty contracting services, offering infrastructure solutions
primarily to the electric power and oil and gas industries in North America and in select international markets. The services we provide include the design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of infrastructure within each of the
industries we serve, such as electric power transmission and distribution networks, substation facilities, renewable energy facilities, pipeline transmission and distribution systems and facilities, and infrastructure services for the offshore and
inland water energy markets. We also own fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure in select markets and license the right to use these point-to-point fiber optic telecommunications facilities to customers and have recently expanded our fiber
optic service offerings to include lit network services.

Effective December 31, 2013, Quanta’s Natural Gas and
Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment was renamed the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment to better align with this segment’s service offerings and end-customer markets. No changes have been made to this segment’s financial
results. Our results are reported under three reportable segments: (1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services, (2) Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services and (3) Fiber Optic Licensing and Other. This structure is generally focused on
broad end-user markets for our services. Our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 were approximately $6.52 billion, of which 69% was attributable to the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment, 29% to the Oil and
Gas Infrastructure Services segment and 2% to the Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment.

We have established a presence
throughout the United States, Canada and Australia with a workforce of approximately 20,900 employees as of December 31, 2013, which enables us to quickly, reliably and cost-effectively serve a diversified customer base. We believe our
reputation for responsiveness and performance, geographic reach, comprehensive service offering, safety leadership and financial strength have resulted in strong relationships with numerous customers, which include many of the leading companies in
the industries we serve. Our ability to deploy services to customers throughout North America as a result of our broad geographic presence and significant scope and scale of services is particularly important to our customers who operate networks
that span multiple states or regions. We believe these same factors also position us to continue to take advantage of other international opportunities.

We were organized as a corporation in the state of Delaware in 1997, and since that time we
have grown organically and have made strategic acquisitions, expanding our geographic presence and scope of services and developing new capabilities to meet our customers’ evolving needs.

We believe that our business strategies, along with our competitive and financial strengths, are key elements in
differentiating us from our competition and position us to capitalize on future capital spending by our customers. We offer comprehensive and diverse solutions on a broad geographic scale and have a solid base of long-standing customer relationships
in each of the industries we serve. We also have an experienced management team, both at the executive level and within our operating units, and various proprietary technologies that enhance our service offerings. Our strategies of expanding the
portfolio of services we provide to our existing and potential customer base, increasing our geographic and technological capabilities, promoting best practices and cross-selling our services to our customers, as well as continuing to maintain our
financial strength, place us in the position to capitalize on opportunities and trends in the industries we serve and to expand our operations globally. We continue to evaluate potential acquisitions of companies with strong management teams and
good reputations and believe that our financial strength and experienced management team is attractive to potential acquisition targets.

We and our customers continue to operate in a somewhat uncertain business environment, and although there has been gradual
improvement in the economy, our customers continue to face stringent regulatory and environmental requirements as they implement projects to enhance and expand their infrastructure. These economic and regulatory factors have negatively affected the
timing of demand for our services in the past and may create uncertainty with regard to anticipated customer spending in future periods. We cannot definitively predict the timing or magnitude of the effect that industry trends may have on our
business, particularly in the near-term. However, in recent periods we have experienced an increase in project awards and demand for our services, and many projects that had been negatively impacted by regulatory delays have overcome those
challenges and commenced construction.

On December 3, 2012, we sold substantially all of our domestic
telecommunications infrastructure services operations and related subsidiaries. Accordingly, we have presented the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of such telecommunications subsidiaries as discontinued operations for all
applicable periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Reportable Segments

The following is an overview of the types of services provided by each of our reportable segments and certain of the long-term
industry trends impacting each segment.

Electric Power Infrastructure Services Segment

The Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment provides comprehensive network solutions to customers in the electric power
industry. Services performed by the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power transmission and distribution infrastructure and substation facilities
along with other engineering and technical services. This segment also provides emergency restoration services, including the repair of infrastructure damaged by inclement weather, the energized installation, maintenance and upgrade of electric
power infrastructure utilizing unique bare hand and hot stick methods and our proprietary robotic arm technologies, and the installation of



“smart grid” technologies on electric power networks. In addition, this segment designs, installs and maintains renewable energy generation facilities, consisting of solar, wind and
certain types of natural gas generation facilities, and related switchyards and transmission infrastructure to transport power to demand centers. To a lesser extent, this segment provides services such as the construction of electric power
generation facilities, the design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, installation of traffic networks and the installation of cable and control systems for light rail lines.

Several industry trends provide opportunities for growth in demand for the services provided by the Electric Power
Infrastructure Services segment, including the need to improve the reliability of aging power infrastructure, the expected long-term increase in demand for electric power and the incorporation of renewable generation and other new power generation
sources into the North American power grid. We believe that we are the partner of choice for our electric power and renewable energy customers in need of broad infrastructure expertise, specialty equipment and workforce resources.

Demand for electricity in North America is expected to grow over the long term. North America’s electric power grid was
not designed or constructed to serve today’s power needs and is not adequate to serve the power needs of the future. The electric power grid is aging, continues to deteriorate and lacks redundancy. The increasing demand for electricity, coupled
with the aging infrastructure, has affected and will continue to affect reliability, requiring utilities to upgrade and expand their existing transmission and distribution systems. Current federal legislation also requires the power industry to meet
federal reliability standards for its transmission and distribution systems. These system upgrades are resulting in increased spending and increased demand for our services in the near-term, and we expect this will continue over the long-term as
well.

As demand for power grows, the need for new power generation facilities will grow as well. The future development
of new traditional power generation facilities, as well as renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and certain types of natural gas generation facilities, will require new or expanded transmission infrastructure to transport power to demand
centers. Renewable energy in particular often requires significant transmission infrastructure due to the remote location of renewable sources of energy. As a result, we anticipate that future development of new power generation will lead to
increased demand over the long-term for our electric transmission design and construction services as well as our substation engineering and installation services.

The significant improvement in access to natural gas resources in unconventional shale formations in the United States and
Canada, driven by technological advancements, has dramatically increased the near- and long-term supply of natural gas in North America. This increase in supply has also resulted in low natural gas prices for the past several years and the
anticipation that natural gas prices will remain at attractive levels for the next several years. As a result, it is anticipated that the amount of electricity generated by natural gas powered plants will increase and the majority of new fossil fuel
generation facilities built in North America for the foreseeable future will be fueled by natural gas. Further, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has implemented certain emissions regulations that are resulting in the development of natural
gas generation facilities to replace coal generation plants that are being retired in order to comply with the new regulations. These dynamics are anticipated to result in the need for new transmission and substation infrastructure to be built in
North America to interconnect new natural gas fired generation facilities. It is also anticipated that modifications to and reengineering of existing transmission and substation infrastructure will be required when existing coal generation
facilities are retired or shut down.

We consider renewable energy, including solar, wind and certain types of natural gas
generation facilities, to be an ongoing opportunity for our engineering, project management and installation services. Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the goal of reducing reliance on power generation from fossil fuels, are
creating the need for more renewable energy sources. Renewable portfolio standards (RPS), which mandate that renewable energy constitute a specified percentage of a utility’s power generation by a specified date, exist in many states. We
believe that our comprehensive services, industry knowledge and experience in the design,



installation and maintenance of renewable energy facilities will enable us to support our customers’ renewable energy efforts. Further, we have the financial strength to selectively provide
financing solutions to customers in a modest but strategic way to help facilitate the development of renewable energy and other projects and also potentially create construction backlog for us.

Certain legislative and regulatory actions may also increase demand for our electric power infrastructure services. For
example, in July 2011, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued Order No. 1000, which establishes transmission planning and cost allocation requirements for public utility transmission providers that are intended to facilitate
multi-state electric transmission lines. The order requires planning for transmission to occur on both a local and regional basis and to take into account transmission needs driven by public policy requirements. It also provides rules for cost
allocation across areas so that transmission costs are paid for by the beneficiaries of the infrastructure to be developed. The order also removes certain rights of first refusal from FERC-approved tariffs and agreements, which is intended to
encourage a more competitive marketplace for transmission infrastructure development and allow development to occur more quickly. We believe that certain legislative and regulatory actions, such as FERC Order No. 1000, which was affirmed by
FERC in May 2012, with the issuance of FERC Order No. 1000-A, could have a favorable impact on the development of transmission infrastructure over the medium- and long-term, and as a result, increase demand for our electric transmission
services.

Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Segment

The Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment provides comprehensive network solutions to customers involved in the
development and transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline products. Services performed by the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design, installation, repair and maintenance of pipeline transmission and
distribution systems, gathering systems, production systems and compressor and pump stations, as well as related trenching, directional boring and automatic welding services. In addition, this segment’s services include pipeline protection,
integrity testing, rehabilitation and replacement and fabrication of pipeline support systems and related structures and facilities. In 2013, we expanded into the offshore and inland water energy markets, primarily providing services to oil and gas
exploration platforms, including mechanical installation (or “hook-ups”), electrical and instrumentation, pre-commissioning and commissioning, coatings, fabrication, pipeline construction, integrity services and marine asset repair. To a
lesser extent, this segment designs, installs and maintains airport fueling systems as well as water and sewer infrastructure.

We see potential growth opportunities in this segment, primarily in the installation and maintenance of natural gas, natural
gas byproducts and oil pipelines and related services for gathering systems and pipeline integrity. In particular, we believe the existing pipeline and gathering system infrastructure in North America is insufficient to support the increasing
development of new sources of natural gas, oil and other liquids, such as the unconventional shale formations and Canadian oil sands. We anticipate it will take several years to build this infrastructure and believe this need will increase demand
for our services over time. To diversify our mainline pipe service offerings, we have focused on opportunities to provide our infrastructure services for gathering systems and related facilities, particularly in the liquid-rich shale formations. We
are increasing our presence in the areas of several shale formations through the establishment of local offices to better position us to pursue these opportunities.

Ongoing development of unconventional shale formations throughout North America has resulted in a significant increase in the
continent’s natural gas supply as compared to several years ago. We believe the abundant natural gas supply, combined with lower gas prices, will stimulate demand for increased natural gas usage in the future. As one of the cleanest-burning
fossil fuels for power generation, low-cost natural gas supports the U.S. goals of energy independence from foreign energy sources and a cleaner environment. The U.S. Energy Information Administration has stated that the number of natural
gas-fired power plants built will increase significantly over the next two decades. Also, power generation from renewable energy sources



continues to increase and become a larger percentage of the overall power generation mix. We also believe natural gas will be the fuel of choice to provide backup power generation during times
when renewable energy sources are not available. Additionally, the acceptance of nuclear energy as a means of meeting the growing demand for energy in North America remains uncertain. We believe these factors will result in increasing development of
natural gas power generation to meet North America’s future energy needs, which will in turn result in increased demand for natural gas production and the need for additional pipeline infrastructure to connect natural gas supplies to demand
centers, increasing the demand for our services.

The abundance, low price and long-term supply of North American natural
gas is also resulting in efforts to develop liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities in the United States and Canada, which could provide pipeline and related facilities development opportunities for us. Natural gas prices in various
international markets are significantly higher than North American natural gas prices, making the economics of exporting North American natural gas to international markets attractive. Although a number of LNG export facilities are in various stages
of planning, permitting and development in the United States and Canada, and it is unlikely that all of them will be developed, we believe our comprehensive service offerings and broad geographic presence will enable us to competitively pursue these
opportunities.

We also believe there are significant mainline pipeline opportunities in Australia driven by the
production of coal seam gas for LNG export. A number of LNG export facilities are under construction and proposed for development, and pipelines and related infrastructure will be required to serve these facilities. In addition, unconventional shale
plays in Australia are in the early stages of exploration and development and will require construction of significant gathering, mainline and related infrastructure. Through an acquisition in Australia in 2013, we further expanded our presence in
this region and competitively positioned ourselves to meet Australia’s increasing infrastructure needs.

Additional
pipeline infrastructure is also needed for the transportation of crude oil and other liquids from unconventional shale formations in the United States and Canada. Heavy crude oil from the Canadian oil sands is also being developed and requires
pipelines to be built to take the product to refineries, many of which are in the coastal region along the Gulf of Mexico. Canadian oil sands and shale formations in certain parts of the U.S. and Canada contain significant reserves, and the
economics of the production of these reserves depend on the price of oil. Oil prices are currently at a level that encourages the development of these oil reserves, which will require pipeline infrastructure to be built. We believe this need will
increase demand for our services.

Other infrastructure, primarily midstream gathering systems, is also needed to support
the development of unconventional shale formations. To diversify our transmission pipeline service offerings, we are also focusing on opportunities to provide our infrastructure services for gathering systems and related facilities, particularly in
liquids-rich shale formations.

We believe there are meaningful opportunities for us to penetrate the offshore and inland
water energy markets in providing various infrastructure design, installation and maintenance services primarily to the Gulf of Mexico region but also in select international markets. The offshore service opportunities we see are very similar to
what we perform onshore in this segment, and several of our existing onshore customers who also have offshore assets have expressed interest in our ability to provide offshore services. Demand for offshore energy infrastructure services is similar
to that on land, including the need for engineering, construction and maintenance services for new and existing offshore exploration and production platforms. In addition, the majority of the thousands of miles of marine based pipelines and related
production facilities are approaching or are beyond the end of their useful lives. We see this as an opportunity to leverage our onshore pipeline integrity services and technology to the offshore market’s aging infrastructure. Further, we
believe new regulations and the more stringent enforcement of existing regulations administered by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement may create opportunities for offshore energy infrastructure construction, repair and replacement
services.



As a result of recent significant pipeline incidents in the United States,
federal and state regulatory agencies are implementing new pipeline safety rules and increasing enforcement activities. The U.S. Department of Transportation has implemented significant regulatory legislation through the Pipeline and Hazardous
Materials Safety Administration relating to pipeline integrity requirements. Testing is expected to become more frequent, extensive and invasive, and more information will be available regarding the condition of the United States’ pipeline
infrastructure. As a result, we anticipate a significant increase in spending allocated to pipeline integrity testing, rehabilitation and replacement services, and an increase in demand for the related services we provide over the coming years. We
expect companies will increasingly seek out service providers that can provide a turnkey management solution. We believe we are one of the few companies in North America that offers a complete solution for pipeline companies and gas utilities as
they focus on testing, rehabilitating and replacing their pipeline infrastructure.

Fiber Optic Licensing and Other
Segment

The Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment designs, procures, constructs, maintains and owns fiber optic
telecommunications infrastructure in select markets and licenses the right to use these point-to-point fiber optic telecommunications facilities to our customers pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with terms from five to twenty-five years,
inclusive of certain renewal options. Under these agreements, customers are provided the right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic network (dark fiber), with the network owned and maintained by us. We are also expanding our fiber optic
service offerings to provide lit services, with Quanta providing network management services to customers as well as owning the electronic equipment necessary to make the fiber optic network operational. We believe market opportunities exist for lit
services that will enable us to leverage capacities of our dark fiber networks, as well as providing other attractive growth opportunities. The Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment provides services to communication carriers as well as education,
financial services, healthcare and other business enterprises with high bandwidth telecommunication needs. The telecommunication services primarily provided through this segment are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission and
certain state public utility commissions. The Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment also provides various telecommunication infrastructure services on a limited and ancillary basis, primarily to our customers in the electric power industry.

The growth opportunities in our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment include the continued investment in our dark fiber
networks to serve customers in new geographic regions as well as the expansion into lit services. We see opportunities for lit services for customers in multiple institutional sectors, including communications carriers as well as education,
financial services, healthcare and other business enterprises. These growth opportunities exist in both the markets we currently serve, by expanding our existing network to add new customers, and expansion into new markets through the build-out of
new networks. This expected growth will require significant capital expenditures to support our network expansion efforts.

Financial
Information about Geographic Areas

We operate primarily in the United States; however, we derived $1.31 billion,
$861.5 million and $535.0 million of our revenues from foreign operations during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Of our foreign revenues, approximately 86%, 96% and 97% were earned in Canada during the years
ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, we held property and equipment in the amount of $196.8 million and $151.9 million in foreign countries, primarily Canada, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.

Our business, financial condition and results of operations in foreign countries may be adversely impacted by monetary and
fiscal policies, currency fluctuations, regulatory requirements and other political, social and economic developments or instability. Refer to Item 1A.

“Risk Factors”

for additional information.

Customers, Strategic Alliances and Preferred Provider Relationships

Our customers include electric power and oil and gas companies, as well as commercial, industrial and governmental entities. We
have a large and diverse customer base, including many of the leading companies in



the industries we serve. Our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 34% of our consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31, 2013. Our largest customer accounted for
approximately 9% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Although we have a centralized
marketing and business development strategy, management at each of our operating units is responsible for developing and maintaining successful long-term relationships with customers. Our operating unit management teams build upon existing customer
relationships to secure additional projects and increase revenue from our current customer base. Many of these customer relationships originated decades ago and are maintained through a partnering approach to account management that includes project
evaluation and consulting, quality performance, performance measurement and direct customer contact. Additionally, operating unit management focuses on pursuing growth opportunities with prospective new customers. We encourage operating unit
management to cross-sell services of our other operating units to their customers and to coordinate with our other operating units to pursue projects, especially those that are larger and more complicated. Our business development group supports the
operating units’ activities by promoting and marketing our services for existing and prospective large national accounts, as well as projects that would require services from multiple operating units.

We are a preferred vendor to many of our customers. As a preferred vendor, we have met minimum standards for a specific
category of service, maintained a high level of performance and agreed to certain payment terms and negotiated rates. We strive to maintain preferred vendor status as we believe it provides us an advantage in the award of future work for the
applicable customer.

We believe that our strategic relationships with customers in the electric power and oil and gas
industries will continue to result in future opportunities. Many of these relationships take the form of strategic alliance or long-term maintenance agreements. Strategic alliance agreements generally state an intention to work together over a
period of time and/or on specific types of projects, and many provide us with preferential bidding procedures. Strategic alliances and long-term maintenance agreements are typically agreements for an initial term of approximately two to four years
that may include renewal options to extend the initial term.

Backlog

Backlog is not a term recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles; however, it is a common
measurement used in our industry. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies.

Our backlog represents the amount of consolidated revenue that we expect to realize from future work under construction
contracts, long-term maintenance contracts, master service agreements (MSAs) and licensing agreements. These estimates include revenues from the remaining portion of firm orders not yet completed and on which work has not yet begun, as well as
revenues from change orders, renewal options, and funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent that they are reasonably expected to occur. For purposes of calculating backlog, we include 100% of estimated revenues attributable
to consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities (VIEs). The following table presents our total backlog by reportable segment as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, along with an estimate of the backlog amounts expected to be realized
within 12 months of each balance sheet date (in thousands):

Revenue estimates included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of
project accelerations, cancellations or delays due to various factors, including but not limited to commercial issues, regulatory requirements and adverse weather. These factors can also cause revenue amounts to be realized in periods and at levels
different than originally projected. Generally, our customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services under our MSAs, and while we did not experience any material cancellations during the current periods, most of our
contracts may be terminated, typically upon 30 to 90 days notice, even if we are not in default under the contract. We determine the estimated amount of backlog for work under MSAs by using recurring historical trends inherent in current MSAs,
factoring in seasonal demand and projected customer needs based upon ongoing communications with the customer. In addition, many of our MSAs, as well as contracts for fiber optic licensing, are subject to renewal options. As of December 31,
2013 and 2012, MSAs accounted for approximately 31% and 34% of our estimated 12 month backlog and approximately 44% and 45% of total backlog. There can be no assurance as to our customers’ actual requirements or that our estimates are accurate.

Competition

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete with other contractors in most of the geographic markets in
which we operate, and several of our competitors are large companies that have significant financial, technical and marketing resources. In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into some of the industries in which we operate and, as
a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor. A significant portion of our revenues is currently derived from unit price or fixed price agreements, and price is often an
important factor in the award of such agreements. Accordingly, we could be underbid by our competitors in an effort by them to procure such business. We believe that as demand for our services increases, customers often consider other factors in
choosing a service provider, including technical expertise and experience, financial and operational resources, nationwide presence, industry reputation and dependability, which we expect to benefit larger contractors such as us. In addition,
competition may lessen as industry resources, such as labor supplies, approach capacity. There can be no assurance, however, that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both
price and quality to our services, or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. We also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our existing or prospective customers, including electric power, oil and
gas and engineering companies, which employ personnel who perform some of the same types of services as those provided by us. Although a significant portion of these services is currently outsourced by many of our customers, in particular services
relating to larger energy transmission infrastructure projects, there can be no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource these services in the future.

Employees

As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately 20,900 employees, consisting of approximately 3,200 salaried employees,
including executive officers, professional and administrative staff, project managers and engineers, job superintendents and clerical personnel, and approximately 17,700 hourly employees, the number of which fluctuates depending upon the number and
size of the projects we undertake at any particular time. Approximately 58% of our hourly employees at December 31, 2013 were covered by collective bargaining agreements, primarily with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
(IBEW), the Canadian Union Skilled Workers (CUSW), Australia Workers’ Union and the four pipeline construction trade unions administered by the Pipe Line Contractors Association (PLCA), which are the Laborers International Union of North
America, International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Teamsters), United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters and the International Union of Operating Engineers. These collective bargaining agreements require the payment of specified wages to our
union employees, the observance of certain workplace rules and the payment of certain amounts to multi-employer pension plans and employee benefit trusts rather than us sponsoring or administering the benefit programs provided on behalf of our
employees. These collective bargaining agreements have varying terms and expiration dates. The majority of the collective bargaining agreements contain provisions that prohibit work stoppages or strikes, even during specified negotiation periods
relating to agreement renewals, and provide for binding arbitration dispute resolution in the event of prolonged disagreement.



We provide health, welfare and benefit plans for employees who are not covered by
collective bargaining agreements. We have a 401(k) plan pursuant to which eligible employees who are not provided retirement benefits through a collective bargaining agreement may make contributions through a payroll deduction. We make matching cash
contributions of 100% of each employee’s contribution up to 3% of that employee’s salary and 50% of each employee’s contribution between 3% and 6% of such employee’s salary, up to the maximum amount permitted by law.

Our industry is experiencing a shortage of journeyman linemen in certain geographic areas. In response to the shortage and to
attract qualified employees, we utilize various IBEW and National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) training programs and support the joint IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program which trains qualified electrical workers. Certain of our Canadian
operations also support the CUSW’s apprenticeship programs for training construction and maintenance electricians and powerline technicians. We have also established apprenticeship training programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor
for employees not subject to the IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program, as well as additional company-wide and project-specific employee training and educational programs.

We believe our relationships with our employees and union representatives are good.

Materials

Our customers typically supply most or all of the materials required for each job. However, for some of our contracts, we may
procure all or part of the materials required. As we continue to expand our comprehensive engineering, procurement and construction offerings (EPC), particularly associated with utility scale solar projects, the cost of materials may become a
proportionately larger component of our consolidated cost of services. We purchase such materials from a variety of sources and do not anticipate experiencing any significant difficulties in procuring such materials.

Training, Quality Assurance and Safety

Performance of our services requires the use of equipment and exposure to conditions that can be dangerous. Although we are
committed to a policy of operating safely and prudently, we have been and will continue to be subject to claims by employees, customers and third parties for property damage and personal injuries resulting from performance of our services. Our
operating units have established comprehensive safety policies, procedures and regulations and require that employees complete prescribed training and service programs prior to performing more sophisticated and technical jobs, which is in addition
to those programs required, if applicable, by the IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program, the training programs sponsored by the four trade unions administered by the PLCA, the apprenticeship training programs sponsored by the CUSW or our equivalent
programs. Under the IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program, all journeyman linemen are required to complete a minimum of 7,000 hours of on-the-job training, approximately 144 hours of classroom education and extensive testing and certification.
Certain of our operating units have established apprenticeship training programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor that prescribe equivalent training requirements for employees who are not otherwise subject to the requirements of the
IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program. Similarly, the CUSW offers apprenticeship training for construction and maintenance electricians that requires five terms of 1,700 hours each, combining classroom and on-the-job training, as well as training for
powerline technicians that also involves classroom and jobsite training over a four-year period. In addition, the Laborers International Union of North America, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters
and the International Union of Operating Engineers have training programs specifically designed for developing and improving the skills of their members who work in the pipeline construction industry. Our operating units also benefit from sharing
best practices regarding their training and educational programs and comprehensive safety policies and regulations.



Regulation

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations including:

•

licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to contractors, electricians and engineers;

•

regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection;

•

permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects;

•

wage and hour regulations;

•

regulations relating to transportation of equipment and materials, including licensing and permitting requirements;

•

building and electrical codes;

•

telecommunications regulations relating to our fiber optic licensing business; and

•

special bidding, procurement and other requirements on government projects.

We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our operations and that we are in substantial compliance with
applicable regulatory requirements. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses, as well as give rise to termination or cancellation rights under our contracts or
disqualify us from future bidding opportunities.

Environmental Matters and Climate Change Impacts

We are committed to the protection of the environment and train our employees to perform their duties accordingly. We are
subject to numerous federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations governing our operations, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions
and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the
environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of previously owned or operated properties, or properties to which hazardous substances or wastes were sent by current or former operations at our
facilities, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect
our ability to sell, lease or use our properties as collateral for financing. In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations and also could be subject to a revocation of
our licenses or permits, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. Our contracts with our customers may also impose liabilities on us regarding environmental issues that arise through the
performance of our services.

From time to time, we may incur costs and obligations for correcting environmental
noncompliance matters and for remediation at or relating to certain of our properties. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with our environmental obligations to date and that any such obligations will not have a material adverse effect
on our business or financial performance.

The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly
uncertain. Climate change may result in, among other things, changes in rainfall patterns, storm patterns and intensities and temperature levels. As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in Item 1A.

“Risk Factors”

, our operating results are significantly influenced by weather. Therefore, significant changes in historical weather patterns could significantly impact our future operating results. For example, if climate change
results in drier weather and more accommodating temperatures over a greater period of time in a given period, we may be able to increase our productivity, which could have a positive impact on our revenues and gross margins. In addition,



if climate change results in an increase in severe weather, such as hurricanes and ice storms, we could experience a greater amount of higher margin emergency restoration service work, which
generally has a positive impact on our gross margins. Conversely, if climate change results in a greater amount of rainfall, snow, ice or other less accommodating weather conditions in a given period, we could experience reduced productivity, which
could negatively impact our revenues and gross margins.

Risk Management and Insurance

We are insured for employer’s liability, general liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation claims. On
August 1, 2013, we renewed our employer’s liability, general liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation policies for the 2013 - 2014 policy year. As a result of the renewal, the deductibles for general liability and auto
liability increased from $5.0 million to $10.0 million per occurrence, while the deductible for workers’ compensation remained at $5.0 million per occurrence and the deductible for employer’s liability remained at $1.0 million per
occurrence. Additionally, in connection with this renewal, the amount of letters of credit required by us to secure our obligations under our casualty insurance programs has increased. Between August 1, 2009 and July 31, 2013, all policy
deductible levels were $5.0 million per occurrence, other than employer’s liability, which was subject to a deductible of $1.0 million. We also have employee health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining
agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $375,000 per claimant per year.

Losses under all of
these insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to
assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known
facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the gross amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $161.8 million and $160.8 million, with $122.6 million and $120.2 million
considered to be long term and included in other non-current liabilities. Related insurance recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $9.1 million and $22.2 million, of which $0.7 million and $2.3 million are included in
prepaid expenses and other current assets and $8.4 million and $19.9 million are included in other assets, net.

We renew
our insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel our coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or we may elect
not to obtain certain types or incremental levels of insurance if we believe that the cost to obtain such coverage exceeds the additional benefits obtained. In any such event, our overall risk exposure would increase, which could negatively affect
our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Seasonality and Cyclicality

Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced by
weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, project timing and schedules, and holidays. Typically, our revenues are lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or wet conditions can cause delays in projects. In addition,
many of our customers develop their capital budgets for the coming year during the first quarter and do not begin infrastructure projects in a meaningful way until their capital budgets are finalized. Second quarter revenues are typically higher
than those in the first quarter, as some projects begin, but continued cold and wet weather can often impact second quarter productivity. Third quarter revenues are typically the highest of the year, as a greater number of projects are underway and
weather is more accommodating. Generally, revenues during the fourth quarter of the year are lower than the third quarter but higher than the second quarter. Many projects are completed in the fourth quarter, and revenues are often impacted
positively by customers seeking to spend their capital budgets before the end of the year; however, the



holiday season and inclement weather can sometimes cause delays, reducing revenues and increasing costs. Any quarter may be positively or negatively affected by atypical weather patterns in a
given part of the world, such as severe weather, excessive rainfall or warmer winter weather, making it difficult to predict these variations and their effect on particular projects quarter to quarter. The timing of project awards and unanticipated
changes in project schedules as a result of delays or accelerations can also create variations in the level of operating activity from quarter to quarter.

These seasonal impacts are typical for our U.S. operations, but as our foreign operations continue to grow, we may see a
lessening of this pattern impacting our quarterly revenues. For example, revenues in Canada are often higher in the first quarter as projects are accelerated so that work can be completed prior to the “break up”, as productivity is
adversely affected by wet ground conditions during the warmer spring and summer months. Also, although revenues from Australia and other international operations have not been significant to our overall revenues to date, their seasonal patterns may
differ from those in North America and may impact our seasonality more in the future.

Additionally, our industry can be
highly cyclical. As a result, our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines or delays in new projects in various geographic regions, including the United States, Canada and Australia. Project schedules, particularly in connection with
larger, longer-term projects, can also create fluctuations in the services provided, which may adversely affect us in a given period. The financial condition of our customers and their access to capital, variations in the margins of projects
performed during any particular period, regional, national and global economic and market conditions, timing of acquisitions, the timing and magnitude of acquisition and integration costs associated with acquisitions, dispositions, fluctuations in
our equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and interest rate fluctuations are examples of items that may also materially affect quarterly results. Accordingly, our operating results in any particular period may not be indicative of the
results that can be expected for any other period. You should read

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties
described below. The matters described below are not the only risks and uncertainties facing our



company. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected and we may not be able to achieve our goals or expectations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also includes statements reflecting assumptions, expectations,
projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as “forward-looking statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled

“Uncertainty of Forward-Looking Statements and Information”

included in Item 7.

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.

Our business can be highly cyclical and subject to seasonal and other variations that can result in significant differences in
operating results from quarter to quarter. For example, we typically experience lower gross and operating margins during winter months due to lower demand for our services and more difficult operating conditions. Additionally, our quarterly results
may be materially and/or adversely affected by:

•

permitting, regulatory or customer-caused delays on projects;

•

adverse weather conditions;

•

variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter;

•

unfavorable regional, national or global economic and market conditions;

•

a reduction in the demand for our services;

•

the budgetary spending patterns of customers and federal, state and local governments;

•

disruptions in our customers’ strategic plans which could occur as a result of emerging technologies;

•

increases in construction and design costs;

•

the timing and volume of work we perform;

•

the magnitude of work performed under change orders and the timing of their recognition;

•

the ability to successfully negotiate and obtain reimbursement for pending change orders;

•

liabilities associated with pension plans in which our employees participate or withdrawals therefrom;

•

changes in accounting pronouncements that require us to account for items differently than historical pronouncements have;

•

losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance;

•

a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;

•

payment risk associated with the financial condition of our customers;

•

the termination or expiration of existing agreements;

•

pricing pressures resulting from competition;

•

changes in bonding and lien requirements applicable to existing and new agreements;

•

implementation of various information systems, which could temporarily disrupt day-to-day operations;

•

the recognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions;

•

costs we incur to support growth internally or through acquisitions or otherwise;

•

the timing and integration of acquisitions and the magnitude of the related acquisition and integration costs; and

•

the timing and significance of potential impairments of long-lived assets, equity or other investments, goodwill or other intangible assets.



Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be
indicative of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or for the entire year.

Negative economic and
market conditions may adversely impact our customers’ future spending as well as payment for our services and, as a result, our operations and growth.

The economy is still recovering from the recession in 2008 and 2009, and there is continuing uncertainty in the marketplace.
Stagnant or declining economic conditions have adversely impacted the demand for our services in the past and resulted in the delay, reduction or cancellation of certain projects and may adversely affect us in the future. Additionally, many of our
customers finance their projects through the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. A reduction in cash flow or the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a reduction in our customers’ spending for our services
and may also impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to grow at historical levels.

Regulatory and environmental requirements and economic conditions affecting any of the industries we serve may lead to
less demand for our services.

Because the vast majority of our revenue is derived from a few industries,
regulatory and environmental requirements or a downturn in economic conditions affecting any of those industries would adversely affect our results of operations. Customers in the industries we serve face heightened regulatory and environmental
requirements and stringent permitting processes as they implement plans for their projects, which can result in delays, reductions and cancellations of some of their projects. Additionally, unfavorable economic conditions in any industry we serve
could result in the delay, reduction or cancellation of projects by our customers, as well as cause our customers to outsource less work. These regulatory and economic factors have resulted in decreased demand for our services in the past, and they
may continue to do so in the future, potentially impacting our operations and our ability to grow at historical levels. A number of other factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve or a prolonged
economic downturn or recession, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future or pay for past services. Consolidation, competition, capital constraints or negative economic
conditions in the electric power and oil and gas industries may also result in reduced spending by, or the loss of, one or more of our customers.

Project performance issues, including those caused by third parties, or certain contractual obligations may result in
additional costs to us, reductions or delays in revenues or the payment of liquidated damages.

Many projects
involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases that may occur over extended time periods, sometimes over several years. We may encounter difficulties as a result of delays in designs, engineering information or materials
provided by the customer or a third party, delays or difficulties in equipment and material delivery, schedule changes, delays from our customers’ failure to timely obtain permits or rights-of-way or meet other regulatory requirements,
weather-related delays and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, that can impact our ability to complete the project in accordance with the original delivery schedule. A failure by us to properly manage and invest in our equipment
fleet could also negatively impact project performance and our results of operations. In addition, we occasionally contract with third-party subcontractors to assist us with the completion of contracts. Any delay or failure by suppliers or by
subcontractors in the completion of their portion of the project may result in delays in the overall progress of the project or may cause us to incur additional costs, or both. We also may encounter project delays due to local opposition, which may
include injunctive actions as well as public protests, to the siting of electric power, natural gas or oil transmission lines, solar or wind projects, or other facilities. Delays and additional costs may be substantial and, in some cases, we may be
required to compensate the customer for such delays. We may not be able to recover all of such costs. In certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance
testing levels. Failure to meet any of our schedules or performance requirements could also result in additional costs or penalties, including liquidated



damages, and such amounts could exceed expected project profit. In extreme cases, the above-mentioned factors could cause project cancellations, and we may not be able to replace such projects
with similar projects or at all. Such delays or cancellations may impact our reputation or relationships with customers, adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts.

Our customers may change or delay various elements of a project after its commencement, or the design, engineering
information, equipment or materials that are to be provided by the customer or other parties may be deficient or delivered later than required by the project schedule, resulting in additional direct or indirect costs. Under these circumstances, we
generally negotiate with the customer with respect to the amount of additional time required and the compensation to be paid to us. We are subject to the risk that we may be unable to obtain, through negotiation, arbitration, litigation or
otherwise, adequate amounts to compensate us for the additional work or expenses incurred by us due to customer-requested change orders or failure by the customer to timely deliver items, such as engineering drawings or materials, required to be
provided by the customer. Litigation or arbitration of project change orders or claims for compensation may be lengthy and costly, and it is often difficult to predict when and for how much the claims will be resolved. A failure to obtain adequate
compensation for these matters could require us to record a reduction to amounts of revenue and gross profit recognized in prior periods under the percentage-of-completion accounting method. Any such adjustments could be substantial. We may also be
required to invest significant working capital to fund cost overruns while the resolution of claims is pending, which could adversely affect liquidity and financial results in any given period.

Our business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.

Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled
personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy. For instance, we may experience shortages of
qualified journeyman linemen, who are integral to the provision of transmission and distribution services under our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. In addition, in our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment, there is limited
availability of experienced supervisors and foremen that can oversee large mainline pipe projects. A shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel creates competitive hiring markets and may result in increased labor expenses. Labor shortages or
increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues or profitability.

Our
use of fixed price contracts could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We currently generate
a portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. We also expect to generate a greater portion of our revenues under this type of contract in the future as larger projects, such as electric power and pipeline transmission build-outs and
utility-scale solar facilities, become a more significant aspect of our business. We assume risks related to revenue and cost on fixed-priced contracts. Actual revenues and project costs can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original
projections due to changes in a variety of factors including:

•

unforeseen circumstances not included in our cost estimates or covered by our contract for which we cannot obtain adequate compensation;

•

changes in the cost of equipment, commodities, materials or labor;

•

unanticipated costs or claims due to customer-caused delays, errors in specifications or designs, or contract termination and our ability to obtain
reimbursement for such costs;

•

weather conditions;

•

failure to perform by our project owners, suppliers or subcontractors;

•

difficulties in obtaining required permits or approvals;

•

changes in laws and regulations; and

•

general economic conditions.



These variations, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price
contracts may cause actual revenue and gross profits for a project to differ from those we originally estimated and could result in reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending upon the size of a particular project, variations from the
estimated contract costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal period.

Our use of
percentage-of-completion accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits.

As
discussed in Item 7.

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies”

and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8. “

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

”, a significant portion of our revenues are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, utilizing the cost-to-cost method. This method is used because
management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. This accounting method is generally accepted for fixed price contracts. The percentage-of-completion accounting practice we use results in our
recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and
profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined to be probable and reasonably estimable, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability. Further, a substantial portion of our
contracts contain various cost and performance incentives. Penalties are recorded when known or finalized, which generally occurs during the latter stages of the contract. In addition, we record cost recovery claims when we believe recovery is
probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Actual collection of claims could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that
such adjustments could be significant.

Our operating results can be negatively affected by weather conditions.

We perform substantially all of our services in the outdoors. As a result, adverse weather conditions, such as
rainfall or snow, may affect our productivity in performing our services or may temporarily prevent us from performing services. The effect of weather delays on projects that are under fixed price arrangements may be greater if we are unable to
adjust the project schedule for such delays. A reduction in our productivity in any given period or our inability to meet guaranteed schedules may adversely affect the profitability of our projects, and as a result, our results of operations.

We may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth.

Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to:

•

expand the range of services we offer to customers to address their evolving network needs;

•

attract new customers;

•

increase the number of projects performed for existing customers;

•

hire and retain qualified employees;

•

expand geographically, including internationally; and

•

address the challenges presented by stringent regulatory, environmental and permitting requirements and difficult economic or market conditions
that may affect us or our customers.

In addition, our customers may cancel, delay or reduce the number
or size of projects available to us for a variety of reasons, including capital constraints or inability to meet regulatory requirements. Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot
be certain that our strategies for achieving internal growth will be successful.



Our business is highly competitive.

The specialty contracting business is served by numerous small, owner-operated private companies, some public companies and
several large regional companies. In addition, relatively few barriers prevent entry into some areas of our business. As a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become one of our
competitors. A substantial portion of our revenues is directly or indirectly dependent on winning new contracts. The timing of when project awards will be made is unpredictable and often involves complex and lengthy negotiations and bidding
processes. These processes can be impacted by a wide variety of factors, including price, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, commodity prices, environmental conditions and overall market and economic conditions. We are currently
experiencing the impacts of competitive pricing in certain of the markets we serve, such as the electric power market with respect to smaller scale transmission projects and distribution services. In addition, our bids may not be successful because
of a client’s perception of our ability to perform the work or a client’s perception of technology advantages held by our competitors as well as other factors. Certain of our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures. Therefore,
they may be able to provide their services at lower rates than we are able to provide. In addition, some of our competitors have significant resources, including financial, technical and marketing resources. We cannot be certain that our competitors
do not have or will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive
position within the specialty contracting business or maintain our customer base at current levels. We also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our existing or prospective customers. Electric power and oil and gas service
providers usually employ personnel who perform some of the same types of services we do, and we cannot be certain that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource services in the future.

Changes in government spending and legislative actions and initiatives relating to renewable energy and electric power
may adversely affect demand for our services.

Demand for our services may not result from renewable energy
initiatives. While many states currently have mandates in place that require specified percentages of power to be generated from renewable sources, states could reduce those mandates or make them optional, which could reduce, delay or eliminate
renewable energy development in the affected states. Additionally, renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce and may require additional power generation sources as backup. The locations of renewable energy projects are often remote and
are not viable unless new or expanded transmission infrastructure to transport the power to demand centers is economically feasible. Furthermore, funding for renewable energy initiatives may not be available, which has been further constrained as a
result of tight credit markets. These factors have resulted in fewer renewable energy projects than anticipated and a delay in the construction of these projects and the related infrastructure, which has adversely affected the demand for our
services. These factors could continue to result in delays or reductions in projects, which could further negatively impact our business.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) provides for various stimulus programs, such as grants, loan
guarantees and tax incentives, relating to renewable energy, energy efficiency and electric power infrastructure. Some of these programs have expired, which may affect the economic feasibility of future projects. Additionally, while a significant
amount of stimulus funds have been awarded, we cannot predict the timing and scope of any investments to be made under stimulus funding or whether stimulus funding will result in increased demand for our services. Investments for renewable energy,
electric power infrastructure and telecommunications fiber deployment under ARRA programs may not occur, may be less than anticipated or may be delayed, any of which would negatively impact demand for our services.

Other current and potential legislative or regulatory initiatives may not result in increased demand for our services.
Examples include legislation or regulations to require utilities to meet reliability standards, to ease siting and right-of-way issues for the construction of transmission lines, and to encourage installation of new electric power transmission and
renewable energy generation facilities. It is not certain whether existing legislation will create sufficient incentives for new projects, when or if proposed legislative initiatives will be enacted or whether any potentially beneficial provisions
will be included in the final legislation.



There are also a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to address
greenhouse gas emissions, which are in various phases of discussion or implementation. The outcome of federal and state actions to address global climate change could negatively affect the operations of our customers through costs of compliance or
restraints on projects, which could reduce their demand for our services.

Our business is subject to operational
hazards, and we are self-insured against certain potential liabilities.

Our business is subject to significant
operational hazards due to the nature of services provided by our workforce and the conditions in which they operate. These hazards include those involving electricity, fires, natural gas explosions, mechanical failures and weather-related
incidents. Our offshore operations are further subject to heightened risks, including blowouts, collisions, capsizings, vessels sinking and damage from severe weather conditions. These hazards could cause personal injury, severe damage to property,
equipment and the environment and could lead to suspension of operations and legal liabilities. If we are not fully insured or indemnified against such risks or a counterparty fails to meet its indemnification obligations to us, it could materially
and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Further, our safety record may impact our ability to bid on certain work.

On August 1, 2013, we renewed our employer’s liability, general liability, auto liability and workers’
compensation policies for the 2013 — 2014 policy year. As a result of the renewal, the deductibles for general liability and auto liability increased from $5.0 million to $10.0 million per occurrence, while the deductible for workers’
compensation remained at $5.0 million per occurrence and the deductible for employer’s liability remained at $1.0 million per occurrence. Additionally, in connection with this renewal, the amount of letters of credit required by us to secure
our obligations under our casualty insurance programs has increased. We are primarily self-insured for all claims that do not exceed the amount of the applicable deductible. We also have employee healthcare benefit plans for most employees not
subject to collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $375,000 per claimant per year. Our insurance policies include various coverage requirements, including the requirement to give appropriate notice.
If we fail to comply with these requirements, our coverage could be denied.

Losses under all of these insurance programs
are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due
to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends,
and management believes such accruals are adequate. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs significantly above our estimates, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in a given period.

During the ordinary course of our business, we may become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims, which could
materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We have in the past been, and may in the
future be, named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings during the ordinary course of our business. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers’ compensation, employment
discrimination, breach of contract, property damage, environmental liabilities, punitive damages, and civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the
services we provide and actions we take under our contracts with them, and, in some instances, we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for actions by our customers or other third parties. Because our services in certain instances may be
integral to the operation and performance of our customers’ infrastructure, we have been and may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems that we work on, even if our services are not the cause of such failures, and
we could be subject to civil and criminal liabilities to the extent that our services contributed to any property damage, personal injury or system failure. Insurance coverage may not be available or may be insufficient for these lawsuits, claims or
legal proceedings. The outcome of any of



these lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of management’s attention to the business. Payments of significant amounts, even if reserved,
could adversely affect our reputation, liquidity and results of operations. For details on our existing litigation and claims, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

“Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.”

Unavailability or cancellation of third party insurance coverage would increase our
overall risk exposure as well as disrupt our operations.

We maintain insurance coverage from third party insurers
as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits. There can be no assurance that any of our existing insurance coverage will be renewed upon the expiration of
the coverage period or that future coverage will be affordable at the required limits. In addition, our third party insurers could fail, suddenly cancel our coverage or otherwise be unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage. If any of
these events occur, our overall risk exposure would increase and our operations could be disrupted. For example, we have significant operations in California and other states which have an increased risk of wildfires. Should our insurers determine
to exclude coverage for wildfires in the future, we could be exposed to significant liabilities and potentially a disruption of our California operations. If our risk exposure increases as a result of adverse changes in our insurance coverage, we
could be subject to increased claims and liabilities that could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Many of our contracts may be canceled on short notice or may not be renewed upon completion or expiration, and we may be
unsuccessful in replacing our contracts in such events, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We could experience a decrease in our revenue, net income and liquidity if any of the following occur:

•

our customers cancel a significant number of contracts or contracts having significant value;

•

we fail to renew a significant number of our existing contracts;

•

we complete a significant number of non-recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects; or

•

we fail to reduce operating and overhead expenses consistent with any decrease in our revenue.

Many of our customers may cancel our contracts on short notice, typically 30 to 90 days, even if we are not in default
under the contract. Certain of our customers assign work to us on a project-by-project basis under master service agreements. Under these agreements, our customers often have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us. Our operations
could decline significantly if the anticipated volume of work is not assigned to us, which will be more likely if customer spending decreases, for example, due to the slow recovery of the economy. Many of our contracts, including our master service
agreements, are opened to public bid at the expiration of their terms. There can be no assurance that we will be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that come up for re-bid.

The nature of our business exposes us to warranty claims, which may reduce our profitability.

Under our contracts with customers, we typically provide a warranty for the services we provide, guaranteeing the work
performed against defects in workmanship and material. The majority of our contracts have a warranty period of 12 months. As much of the work we perform is inspected by our customers for any defects in construction prior to acceptance of the
project, the warranty claims that we have historically received have been minimal. Additionally, materials used in construction are often provided by the customer or are warranted against defects from the supplier. However, certain projects, such as
utility-scale solar facilities, may have longer warranty periods and include facility performance warranties that may be broader than the warranties we generally provide. In these circumstances, if warranty claims occurred, it could require us to
re-perform the services or to repair or replace the warranted item, at a cost to us, and could also result in other damages if we are



not able to adequately satisfy our warranty obligations. In addition, we may be required under contractual arrangements with our customers to warrant any defects or failures in materials we
provide that we purchase from third parties. While we generally require the materials suppliers to provide us warranties that are consistent with those we provide to the customers, if any of these suppliers default on their warranty obligations to
us, we may incur costs to repair or replace the defective materials for which we are not reimbursed. Costs incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.

The loss of one or a few customers could have a material adverse effect on us.

A few customers have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue in any one year or over
a period of several consecutive years. Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant customers, our customers may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their contracts with us at any time. Our loss of business from a
significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our profitability and financial condition may be adversely affected by risks associated with the oil and gas industry,
such as price fluctuations and supply and demand for natural gas.

Certain of our services, in particular those
under our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment, are exposed to risks associated with the oil and gas industry. These risks, which are not subject to our control, include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices, the lack of demand for
power generation from natural gas and a slowdown in the discovery or development of natural gas and/or oil reserves. Specifically, lower natural gas and oil prices generally result in decreased spending by our customers in our Oil and Gas
Infrastructure Services segment. The significant increase in the North American supply of natural gas due to ongoing development of unconventional shale formations has resulted in low natural gas prices for the past several years. While higher
natural gas and oil prices generally result in increased infrastructure spending by these customers, sustained high energy prices could be an impediment to economic growth and could result in reduced infrastructure spending by such customers. Higher
prices could also decrease spending on natural gas fired electricity generation facilities and related infrastructure, an important component of our electric power infrastructure services business. Additionally, higher prices will likely reduce
demand for power generation from natural gas, which could result in decreased demand for the expansion of North America’s natural gas pipeline infrastructure, and consequently result in less capital spending by these customers and less demand
for our services.

Further, if the discovery or development of natural gas and/or oil reserves slowed or stopped,
customers would likely reduce capital spending on mainline pipe, gas gathering and compressor systems and other related infrastructure, resulting in less demand for our services. If the profitability of our business under the Oil and Gas
Infrastructure Services segment were to decline, our overall profitability, results of operations and cash flows could also be adversely affected.

Backlog may not be realized or may not result in profits.

Backlog is not a term recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles; however, it is a common
measurement used in our industry. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies. Furthermore, backlog is difficult to determine with certainty. Customers often have no obligation under our
contracts to assign or release work to us, and many contracts may be terminated on short notice. Reductions in backlog due to cancellation of one or more contracts or projects by a customer or for other reasons could significantly reduce the revenue
and profit we actually receive from contracts included in backlog. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but would not have a contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog. The backlog we
obtain in connection with any companies we acquire may not be as large as we believed or may not result in the revenue or profits we expected. In addition, projects that are delayed may remain in backlog for extended periods of time. All of these
uncertainties are heightened by negative economic conditions and their impact on our



customers’ spending, as well as the effects of regulatory requirements and weather conditions. Consequently, we cannot assure that our estimates of backlog are accurate or that we will be
able to realize our estimated backlog.

Our financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that may
differ from actual results.

In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, several estimates and assumptions are used by management in determining the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future
events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine, and we
must exercise significant judgment. Estimates are used primarily in our assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of assets, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill, other intangibles and long-lived
asset impairments, equity and other investments, loan receivables, purchase price allocations, liabilities for self-insured and other claims, multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, revenue recognition for construction contracts
inclusive of contractual change orders and claims, revenue recognition for fiber optic licensing contracts, share-based compensation, operating results of reportable segments, provision (benefit) for income taxes and the calculation of uncertain tax
positions. Actual results for all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our inability to successfully execute our acquisition strategy may have an adverse impact on our growth strategy.

Our business strategy includes expanding our presence in the industries we serve through strategic acquisitions of
companies that complement or enhance our business. The number of acquisition targets that meet our criteria may be limited, and we may also face competition for acquisition opportunities. Some of our competitors may offer more favorable terms than
us or have greater financial resources than we do. This competition may further limit our acquisition opportunities and our ability to grow through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions and make them less accretive or possibly not
accretive to us. Acquisitions that we may pursue may also involve significant cash expenditures, the incurrence or assumption of debt or burdensome regulatory requirements. Any acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any of these factors could inhibit our ability to consummate future acquisitions, which could negatively affect our growth strategies.

We may be unsuccessful at integrating businesses that either we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future,
which may reduce the anticipated benefit from acquired businesses.

As a part of our business strategy, we have
acquired, and may seek to acquire in the future, companies that complement or enhance our business. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquired businesses, such as the expansion of
our existing operations, elimination of redundant costs and capitalizing on cross-selling opportunities. To realize these benefits, however, we must successfully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our existing operations. We
cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully integrate acquired companies with our existing operations without substantial costs, delays, disruptions or other operational or financial problems. Additionally, if we do not implement proper
overall business controls, our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent operating and financial practices at the companies we acquire. Issues related to the integration process may result in adverse impact to our revenues,
earnings and cash flows. Integrating our acquired companies involves a number of special risks



that could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including:

•

failure of acquired companies to achieve the results we expect;

•

diversion of our management’s attention from operational and other matters;

•

difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies;

•

inability to retain key personnel of acquired companies;

•

risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities;

•

loss of business due to customer overlap or change from local or private ownership;

•

risks arising from the prior operations of acquired companies, such as performance, operational, safety or workforce issues, or customer
dissatisfaction; and

•

potential disruptions of our business.

Our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of impairments of goodwill, other intangible assets or
our investments.

When we acquire a business, we record an asset called “goodwill” equal to the excess
amount we pay for the business, including liabilities assumed, over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of the business we acquire. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives cannot be amortized, but
instead must be tested at least annually for impairment, while intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives. The accounting literature provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other non-amortized
intangible assets for impairment. Refer to Item 7.

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies”

for a detailed discussion. Management is
required to make certain estimates and assumptions when allocating goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of a reporting unit’s net assets and liabilities, including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions,
projected cash flows, investment rates, cost of capital and growth rates, which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair value is determined using a combination of the discounted cash flow, market
multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches. Absent any impairment indicators, we perform our impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter. If there is a decrease in market capitalization below book value in the future, this may
be considered an impairment indicator.

In addition, we enter into various types of investment arrangements in the normal
course of business, each having unique terms and conditions. These investments may include equity interests we hold in business entities, including general or limited partnerships, contractual joint ventures or other forms of equity participation.
These investments may also include our participation in different finance structures such as the extension of loans to project specific entities, the acquisition of convertible notes issued by project specific entities or other strategic financing
arrangements. Our equity method investments are carried at original cost and are included in other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheet and are adjusted for our proportionate share of the investees’ income, losses and distributions.
Equity investments are reviewed for impairment by assessing whether any decline in the fair value of the investment below the carrying value is other than temporary. In making this determination, factors such as the ability to recover the carrying
amount of the investment and the inability of the investee to sustain future earnings capacity are evaluated in determining whether an impairment has occurred and should be recognized.

Any future impairments, including impairments of goodwill, intangible assets or investments, could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recognized.



New federal or state telecommunications regulations, or changes in, or
interpretations of, existing regulations, could adversely affect our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment.

Many
of our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment customers benefit from the Universal Service

“E-rate”

program, which was established by Congress in the 1996 Telecommunications Act and is administered
by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) under the oversight of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Under the E-rate program, schools, libraries and certain healthcare facilities may receive subsidies for certain approved
telecommunications services, internet access and internal connections. From time to time, bills have been introduced in Congress that would eliminate or curtail the E-rate program. Passage of such actions by the FCC or USAC to further limit E-rate
subsidies could decrease the demand by certain customers for the services offered by our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment.

The licensing services we provide through our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment are subject to regulation by the FCC, to
the extent that they are interstate telecommunications services, and by state regulatory agencies, when wholly within a particular state. To remain eligible to provide services under the E-rate program, we must maintain telecommunications
authorizations in every state where we operate, and we must obtain such authorizations in any new state where we plan to operate. Changes in federal or state regulations could reduce the profitability of our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment,
and delays in obtaining new authorizations could inhibit our ability to grow our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment in new geographic areas. We could be subject to fines if the FCC or a state regulatory agency were to determine that any of our
activities or positions are not in compliance with certain regulations. If the profitability of our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment were to decline, or if the business of this segment were to become subject to fines, our overall results of
operations and cash flows could also be adversely affected.

Our fiber optic services are capital intensive, require
substantial investments, may expose us to industry specific risks and may have returns on investments that are less than expected.

Our fiber optic licensing business requires substantial amounts of capital investment to build out new fiber networks. In 2014,
our proposed capital expenditures for our fiber optic licensing business are approximately $50 million to $60 million, $38.8 million of which is related to committed licensing arrangements as of December 31, 2013. Although we generally do not
commit capital to new networks until we have a committed license arrangement in place with at least one customer, we may not be able to recoup our initial investment in the network, and we may not realize a return on the capital investment for an
extended period of time. Furthermore, the amount of capital that we invest in our fiber optic network may exceed planned expenditures as a result of various factors, including difficulty in obtaining permits or rights of way or unexpected increases
in costs due to labor, materials or project productivity, which would result in a decrease in the returns on our capital investments if licensing fees for the network were committed and could not be renegotiated. New or developing technologies or
significant competition in any of our markets could also negatively impact our fiber optic licensing business. Any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations or result in an impairment of our fiber optic network.

Our expansion into the lit services market exposes us to additional risks, as we will be providing access to the fiber network
that we own, as well as providing networking equipment and assuming responsibility for network management and service quality. These risks include, but are not limited to, those related to our ability to secure customers for our network in a
competitive environment, and the ability to obtain additional capacity in the event of increased demand; network failures and service interruptions, including those outside of our control when we use dark fiber networks or circuits that we do not
own or operate, which could expose us to customer liability or require expensive modifications; our ability to obtain agreements with building owners and managers to provide us with access to serve customers in multi-tenant facilities; our ability
to obtain or construct additional building laterals to connect new buildings to our network; compliance with laws and regulations applicable to Internet service providers; Internet connectivity at both public and private interconnection points with
network providers; relationships and agreements with carrier neutral data center operators and incumbent local exchange carriers; and security breaches and unauthorized access to our systems.



We extend credit to customers for purchases of our services and may enter
into longer-term deferred payment arrangements or provide other financing or investment arrangements with certain of our customers, which subjects us to potential credit or investment risk that could, if realized, adversely affect our results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We grant credit, generally without collateral, to our customers,
which include electric power utilities, oil and gas companies, governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of renewable energy facilities and commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the United
States, Canada and Australia. We may also agree to allow our customers to defer payment on projects until certain milestones have been met or until the projects are substantially completed, and customers typically withhold some portion of amounts
due to us as retainage. In addition, we may provide other forms of financing to our customers or make investments in our customers’ projects, typically in situations where we also provide services in connection with the projects. Our payment
arrangements with our customers subject us to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors affecting our customers, including material changes in our customers’ revenues or cash flows. These changes may also reduce
the value of any financing or equity investment arrangements we have with our customers. Many of our customers have been negatively impacted by uncertain economic conditions in recent years, and some may experience financial difficulties (including
bankruptcies) that could impact our ability to collect amounts owed to us or impair the value of our investments in them. If we are unable to collect amounts owed to us, our cash flows would be reduced, and we could experience losses if the
uncollectible amounts exceeded current allowances. We would also recognize losses with respect to any investments that are impaired as a result of our customers’ financial difficulties. Losses experienced could materially and adversely affect
our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The risks of collectability and impairment losses may increase for projects where we provide services as well as make a financing or equity investment.

The loss of key personnel could disrupt our business.

We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and on senior management of our operating units, including the
businesses we acquire. Although we typically enter into employment agreements with terms of one to three years with our executive officers and certain other key employees, we cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for
any particular period of time or that key employees of our future acquisition targets will be willing to enter into such agreements. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our
ability to manage our business. We do not carry key-person life insurance on any of our employees.

We may be
required to contribute cash to meet our underfunded obligations in certain multi-employer pension plans.

Our
collective bargaining agreements generally require us to participate with other companies in multi-employer pension plans. To the extent those plans are underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the
Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, may subject us to substantial liabilities under those plans if we withdraw from them or they are terminated or experience a mass withdrawal. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we
recognized a $32.6 million liability when certain of our subsidiaries withdrew from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (the Central States Plan). The amount of this liability is estimated based on information received
from the multi-employer plan in 2011, although the plan has asserted that additional amounts are due. The actual amount assessed by the plan for the withdrawal and the amount that we ultimately pay for the withdrawal liability may be materially
different than the amount currently recorded. Additionally, on October 9, 2013, we acquired a company that experienced a complete withdrawal from the Central States Plan prior to the date of our acquisition. Central States issued a notice and demand
to the acquired company for a withdrawal liability and the acquired company, and now Quanta, has taken steps to challenge the amount of the assessment by the Central States Plan.



In addition, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 added special funding and
operational rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered,” or “critical” status. Plans in these classifications must
adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to
retiree benefits. A number of multi-employer plans to which we contribute or may contribute in the future are in “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status. The amount of additional funds we may be
obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated, as such amounts will likely be based on future work that requires the specific use of union employees covered by these plans, and the amount of that future work and the number
of employees that may be affected cannot reasonably be estimated. Our performance of a significant amount of future services in areas that require us to utilize unionized employees covered by these affected plans, or a deterioration in the funding
status of any of the plans to which our operating units contribute, could require significant additional contributions, which could detrimentally affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if we are not able to adequately
mitigate these costs.

Our unionized workforce and related obligations could adversely affect our operations.

As of December 31, 2013, approximately 58% of our hourly employees were covered by collective bargaining
agreements. Although the majority of the collective bargaining agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages, certain of our unionized employees participated in a strike and work stoppage during January 2012, and we cannot be certain that strikes
or work stoppages will not occur in the future. Strikes or work stoppages can adversely impact our relationships with our customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease our revenue.

Our ability to complete future acquisitions could be adversely affected because of our union status for a variety of reasons.
For instance, our union agreements may be incompatible with the union agreements of a business we want to acquire, and some businesses may not want to become affiliated with a union-based company. Additionally, we may increase our exposure to
withdrawal liabilities for underfunded multi-employer pension plans to which an acquired company contributes.

Approximately 42% of our hourly employees are not unionized. Under the current U.S. presidential administration, certain
administrative and regulatory actions have been taken and are being considered that could create more flexibility and opportunity for labor unions to organize non-union workers and could result in a greater percentage of our workforce being subject
to collective bargaining agreements, heightening the risks described above. In addition, certain of our customers require or prefer a non-union workforce, and they may reduce the amount of work assigned to us if our non-union labor crews were to
become unionized, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

We may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational impacts relating to occupational health and safety
matters.

Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe
conditions in the workplace. While we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial resources in our occupational health and safety programs, our industry involves a high degree of operational risk and there can be no assurance that we
will avoid significant liability exposure. Although we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions, we have suffered fatalities in the past and may suffer additional fatalities in the future. Serious accidents, including fatalities, may
subject us to substantial penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Claims for damages to persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, which could materially and adversely
affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time or we were to suffer substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety
regulations, our customers could cancel our contracts and elect to procure future services from other providers.



Risks associated with operating in international markets could restrict our
ability to expand globally and harm our business and prospects.

Our international operations are presently
conducted primarily in Canada and Australia, but we have performed work in various other foreign countries, and we expect that the number of countries in which we operate could expand significantly over the next few years. Economic conditions,
including those resulting from wars, civil unrest, acts of terrorism and other conflicts or volatility in the global markets, may adversely affect our customers, their demand for our services and their ability to pay for our services. In addition,
our international operations include business and transactions for which we are paid in local currency. Payments to us in currencies other than the U.S. dollar may exceed our local currency needs, leading to the accumulation of excess local
currency, which, in certain instances, may be subject to either temporary blocking, costly taxes or tariffs, or other difficulties converting to U.S. dollars. There are numerous risks inherent in conducting our business internationally, including,
but not limited to, potential instability in international markets, changes in regulatory requirements applicable to international operations, currency fluctuations in foreign countries, political, economic and social conditions in foreign countries
and complex U.S. and foreign laws and treaties, including tax laws. These risks could restrict our ability to provide services to international customers, operate our international business profitably, or fund our strategic objectives, and our
overall business, liquidity and results of operations could be negatively impacted by our foreign activities.

We
could be adversely affected by our failure to comply with the laws applicable to our foreign activities, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions prohibit U.S.-based
companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption, and in
certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our policies mandate compliance with all applicable anti-bribery laws. Further, we require our partners, subcontractors, agents and others who
work for us or on our behalf to comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees, our agents and others who work with us in foreign countries comply with the FCPA
and other anti-bribery laws, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our agents, employees and intermediaries. If we are found to be liable for FCPA
violations (either due to our own acts or inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation,
business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged FCPA violations is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management.

Our participation in joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners.

As part of our business, we have entered into joint venture arrangements and may enter into additional joint
venture arrangements in the future. The purpose of these joint ventures is typically to combine skills and resources to allow for the performance of particular projects. Success on these jointly performed projects depends in large part on whether
our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations. We and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or
is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from claims or lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more
than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner’s shortfall. Further, if we are unable to adequately address our partner’s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal
liability to us, harm our reputation and reduce our profit on a project.



We are in the process of implementing an information technology (IT)
solution, which could temporarily disrupt day-to-day operations at certain operating units.

We continue to
implement a comprehensive IT solution that we believe will allow for the interface between functions such as accounting and finance, human resources, operations, and fleet management. Continued development and implementation of the IT solution will
require substantial financial and personnel resources. While the IT solution is intended to improve and enhance our information systems, implementation of new information systems at each operating unit exposes us to the risks of start-up of the new
system and integration of that system with our existing systems and processes, including possible disruption of our financial reporting. There is no guarantee that we will realize economic or other intended benefits from continued development and
implementation of the IT solution. Additionally, the IT solution may not be developed or implemented as timely or as accurately as planned. Failure to properly implement the IT solution could result in substantial disruptions to our business,
including coordinating and processing our normal business activities, testing and recording of certain data necessary to provide oversight over our disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal controls over our financial reporting, and
other unforeseen problems.

Failure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially
affect our operations.

IT solution failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our
operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or our information, or damage to our reputation. While
management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach (particularly in light of our ongoing implementation of the
IT solution) will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.

Our
dependence on suppliers, subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could expose us to the risk of loss in our operations.

On certain projects, we rely on suppliers to obtain the necessary materials and subcontractors to perform portions of our
services. We also rely on equipment manufacturers to provide us with the equipment required to conduct our operations. Although we are not dependent on any single supplier, subcontractor or equipment manufacturer, any substantial limitation on the
availability of required suppliers, subcontractors or equipment manufacturers could negatively impact our operations. The risk of a lack of available suppliers, subcontractors or equipment manufacturers may be heightened as a result of market and
economic conditions. To the extent we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials, we could experience losses in the performance of our operations.

We may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth and operations.

If we cannot secure future funds or financing on acceptable terms, we may be unable to support our growth strategy or future
operations. We cannot readily predict the ability of certain customers to pay for past services, and unfavorable economic conditions, such as those experienced over recent years, may negatively impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed
to us. We may also use cash for acquisitions, as well as for investments, both of which are elements of our growth strategy, but we cannot readily predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition or investment efforts. Using cash for
acquisitions and investments limits our financial flexibility and may increase our need to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our existing credit facility contains significant restrictions on our operational and
financial flexibility, including our ability to incur additional debt or conduct certain types of preferred equity financings, and if we seek more debt, we may have to agree to additional covenants that limit our operational and financial
flexibility. If we seek additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that additional debt or equity will be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all. Furthermore, our credit facility is based upon existing commitments from
several banks. Banks have become more restrictive in their lending practices following the difficulties in the credit markets, and some may be unable or unwilling to fund their commitments, which may limit our access to the



capital needed to fund our growth and operations. In addition, we rely on financing companies to fund the leasing of certain of our trucks and trailers, support vehicles and specialty
construction equipment. Credit market conditions may cause certain of these financing companies to restrict or withhold access to capital to fund the leasing of additional equipment. Although we are not dependent on any single equipment lessor, a
widespread lack of available capital to fund the leasing of equipment could negatively impact our future operations. Additionally, the market price of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our
control, which will impact our ability to use equity to obtain funds. A variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including overall market conditions or volatility, a shortfall in our operating
results from those anticipated, negative results or other unfavorable information relating to our market peers or the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our financial results as we expand into
international markets.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, we derived $1.31 billion, or 20.1%, of our
consolidated revenues from foreign operations, the substantial majority of which was earned in Canada and Australia. We intend to expand the volume of services that we provide internationally. As a result, our reported financial condition and
results of operations may be exposed to the effects that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are usually denominated in local currencies, into the
U.S. dollar.

Our business growth could outpace the capability of our decentralized management infrastructure.

We cannot be certain that our management infrastructure will be adequate to support our operations as they expand.
For example, the ability to internally communicate, coordinate and execute business strategies, plans and tactics may be negatively impacted by our increasing size and complexity. A decentralized structure places significant control and
decision-making powers in the hands of local management. This contributes to the risk that we may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting key business matters than we would in a more centralized environment. The lack of
timely access to information may impact the quality of decision making by management. Our decentralized organization creates the possibility that our operating subsidiaries assume excessive risk without appropriate guidance from our centralized
legal, accounting, tax, treasury and insurance functions as to the potential overall impact. Future growth also could impose significant additional responsibilities on members of our senior management, including the need to recruit and integrate new
senior level managers and executives. We cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit and retain such additional managers and executives. To the extent that we are unable to manage our growth effectively, or are unable to attract and retain
additional qualified management, we may not be able to expand our operations or execute our business plan.

We may
be unable to compete for or work on certain projects if we are not able to obtain surety bonds.

A portion of our
business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds or other financial assurances. Current or future market conditions, including losses incurred in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate bankruptcies, as well as changes in
our sureties’ assessment of our operating and financial risk, could cause our surety providers to decline to issue or renew, or substantially reduce the amount of, bid and/or performance bonds for our work and could increase our bonding costs.
These actions could be taken on short notice. If our surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding, our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other sureties, finding more business that does not require bonds or
posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit or cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all, which could affect our ability to bid for or work on
future projects requiring financial assurances.

We have also granted security interests in various of our assets to
collateralize our obligations to our sureties. Furthermore, under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a project-



by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds. If we were to experience an
interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or any other reasons, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects that would require bonding.

Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities.

Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including those dealing with the handling and
disposal of waste products, PCBs, fuel storage and air quality. We perform work in many different types of underground environments. If the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate, or if objects are present in the soil that are not
indicated on the field location maps, our underground work could strike objects in the soil, some of which may contain pollutants. These objects may also rupture, resulting in the discharge of pollutants. In such circumstances, we may be liable for
fines and damages, and we may be unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect information. We perform work in and around environmentally sensitive areas such as rivers, lakes and wetlands. In addition, we perform
directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies. Due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies, it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture, resulting
in the release of subsurface materials. These subsurface materials may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law, potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines. We also own and lease several facilities at which we store our
equipment. Some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks that are above or below ground. If these tanks were to leak, we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines.

In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously
unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could negatively impact our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows. In certain instances, we have obtained indemnification or covenants from third parties (including predecessors or lessors) for such clean-up and other obligations and liabilities that we believe are adequate to cover such
obligations and liabilities. However, such third-party indemnities or covenants may not cover all of our costs and the indemnitors may not pay amounts owed to us, and such unanticipated obligations or liabilities, or future obligations and
liabilities, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Further, we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities
relating to any acquired business.

There are also other legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas
emissions. These proposals, if enacted, could result in a variety of regulatory programs including potential new regulations, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, or other regulatory actions. Any of these actions could result in
increased costs associated with our operations and impact the prices we charge our customers. For example, if new regulations are adopted regulating greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources such as cars and trucks, we could experience a
significant increase in environmental compliance costs in light of our large rolling-stock fleet. In addition, if our operations are perceived to result in high greenhouse gas emissions, our reputation could suffer.

We may not be successful in continuing to meet the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has many requirements applicable to us regarding corporate governance and financial reporting,
including the requirements for management to report on our internal controls over financial reporting and for our independent registered public accounting firm to express an opinion over the operating effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting. During 2013, we continued actions to ensure our ability to comply with these requirements. As of December 31, 2013, our internal control over financial reporting was effective; however, there can be no assurance that our
internal control over financial reporting will be effective in future years. Failure to maintain effective internal controls or the identification of significant internal control deficiencies in acquisitions already made or made in the future could
result in a



decrease in the market value of our common stock and our other publicly traded securities, the reduced ability to obtain financing, the loss of customers, penalties and additional expenditures to
meet the requirements.

If we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property
rights become obsolete, our competitive position could be adversely impacted.

We utilize a variety of intellectual
property rights in our services. We view our portfolio of proprietary energized services tools and techniques, as well as our other process and design technologies, as one of our competitive strengths, which we believe differentiates our service
offerings. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our services may be
sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We also license certain technologies from third parties, and there is a risk that our relationships with licensors may terminate or expire or may
be interrupted or harmed. If we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, or if intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings succeed against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be
reduced. In addition, if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete, we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings, and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers. As a
result, our business and revenue could be materially and adversely affected.

We may incur additional healthcare
costs arising from federal healthcare reform legislation.

In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the ACA) were signed into law in the U.S. The ACA is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those
already insured. The changes and mandates on employers subject to the ACA’s “pay or play” requirements could cause us to incur additional group health insurance costs, although we do not expect any material short-term impact on
our financial results as a result of the ACA. We continue to monitor developments under the ACA and assess the extent to which it could result in long-term material cost increases for us.

Opportunities within the government arena could subject us to increased governmental regulation and costs.

Most government contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process. As we pursue increased opportunities in
the government arena, management’s focus associated with the start-up and bidding process may be diverted away from other opportunities. Involvement with government contracts could require a significant amount of costs to be incurred before any
revenues are realized from these contracts. In addition, as a government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and other public sector regulations, any deemed violation of which could lead to fines or penalties or a loss of
business. Government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors. Government agencies may review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards.
If a government agency determines that costs were improperly allocated to specific contracts, such costs will not be reimbursed or a refund of previously reimbursed costs may be required. If a government agency alleges or proves improper activity,
civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and serious reputational harm could result. Many government contracts must be appropriated each year. If appropriations are not made in subsequent years, we would not realize all of the potential
revenues from any awarded contracts.

Certain provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an
acquisition of our company more difficult.

The following provisions of our certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, as currently in effect, as well as Delaware law, could discourage potential proposals to acquire us, delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common
stock:

•

our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue “blank check” preferred stock and to adopt amendments to our
bylaws;



•

our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be considered at stockholder
meetings;

•

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to act by written
consent; and

•

we are subject to provisions of Delaware law which prohibit us from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions with an
“interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the date such stockholder became classified as an interested stockholder.

ITEM 2.

Properties

Facilities

We lease our corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas and maintain other facilities throughout North America and in
various foreign locations where we conduct business. Our facilities are used for offices, equipment yards, warehouses, storage and vehicle shops. As of December 31, 2013, we owned 37 of the facilities we occupy, many of which are
encumbered by a security interest under our credit facility, and we leased the remainder. We believe that our existing facilities are sufficient for our current needs.

Equipment

We operate a fleet of owned and leased trucks and trailers, support vehicles and specialty construction equipment, such as
backhoes, excavators, trenchers, generators, boring machines, cranes, robotic arms, wire pullers, tensioners, marine vessels and helicopters. Our owned equipment and the leasehold interest in our leased equipment are encumbered by a security
interest under our credit facility. As of December 31, 2013, the total size of the rolling-stock fleet was approximately 27,000 units. Most of our fleet is serviced by our own mechanics who work at various maintenance sites and facilities. We
believe that our equipment is generally well maintained and adequate for our present operations.

ITEM 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract and/or property damages, employment-related damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or
declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record a reserve when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we disclose matters for which
management believes a material loss is at least reasonably possible. See

Unregistered Sales of Securities During the Fourth Quarter of 2013

During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed three acquisitions in which a portion of the consideration consisted of the
unregistered issuance of shares of our common stock. Aggregate consideration consisted of approximately $175.8 million in cash and 2,747,412 shares of our common stock. Such shares of common stock were issued in reliance upon the exemption from
registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the shares were issued to the owners of the businesses acquired in privately negotiated transactions not involving any public offering or solicitation.

During the fourth quarter of 2013, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to purchase, from time to time, up to
$500.0 million of our outstanding common stock through December 31, 2016. These repurchases can be made in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions, including block purchases or otherwise, at management’s discretion based
on market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. This program, which became effective December 6, 2013, does not obligate us to acquire any specific amount of common stock and will continue until completed or
otherwise modified or terminated by our board of directors at any time at its sole discretion and without notice. As of December 31, 2013, there had been no repurchases under this plan.

(2)

Represents shares purchased from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards.

Dividends

We have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2013 or 2012, nor in any
previous periods. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth, development and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we currently do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the
immediate future. The declaration, payment and amount of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors. These factors include our financial condition, results of
operations, cash flows from operations, current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans, the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of Delaware law. In addition, as discussed in

Liquidity and Capital Resources

“Debt Instruments — Credit Facility”

in Item 7.

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”

our credit facility includes limitations on the
payment of cash dividends without the consent of the lenders.

Performance Graph

The following Performance Graph and related information shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be
“filed” with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent
that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.

The following graph compares, for the period from
December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2013, the cumulative stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (the S&P 500 Index) and a peer group selected by our
management that includes public companies within our industry. The current peer group (the 2013 Peer Group) includes Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., EMCOR Group Inc., Fluor Corporation, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., MasTec, Inc., MYR
Group Inc., Pike Electric Corporation, URS Corp. and Willbros Group, Inc. These companies were selected because they comprise a broad group of publicly held corporations, each of which has some operations similar to ours. The peer group used in the
previous year (the 2012 Peer Group) included each of the foregoing companies as well as Dycom Industries, Inc. The shift to the 2013 Peer Group was based on our decision to eliminate from the comparison the company whose operations are concentrated
in a line of business in which we no longer operate.

The graph below assumes an investment of $100 (with reinvestment of
all dividends) in our common stock, the S&P 500 Index and each of the peer groups on December 31, 2008 and tracks their relative performance through December 31, 2013. The returns of each company in the peer group are weighted based on
the market capitalization of each constituent company at the beginning of the measurement period. The stock price performance reflected on the following graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

ITEM 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction
with our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are based upon our current
expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to inaccurate assumptions and known or unknown risks and uncertainties, including those identified in
“Uncertainty of Forward-Looking Statements and Information” below and in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

Introduction

We are a leading provider of specialty contracting services, offering infrastructure solutions primarily to the electric power
and oil and gas industries in North America and in select international markets. The services we provide include the design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of infrastructure within each of the industries we serve, such as electric
power transmission and distribution networks, substation facilities, renewable energy facilities, pipeline transmission and distribution systems and facilities, and infrastructure services for the offshore and inland water energy markets. We also
own fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure in select markets and license the right to use these point-to-point fiber optic telecommunications facilities to customers.

Effective December 31, 2013, Quanta’s Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment was renamed the Oil and
Gas Infrastructure Services segment to better align with this segment’s service offerings and end-customer markets. No changes have been made to this segment’s financial results. We report our results under three reportable segments:
(1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services, (2) Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services and (3) Fiber Optic Licensing and Other. This structure is generally focused on broad end-user markets for our services. Our consolidated revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2013 were approximately $6.52 billion, of which 69% was attributable to the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment, 29% to the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment and 2% to the Fiber Optic Licensing
and Other segment.

Our customers include many of the leading companies in the industries we serve. We have developed
strong strategic alliances with numerous customers and strive to develop and maintain our status as a preferred vendor to our customers. We enter into various types of contracts, including competitive unit price, hourly rate, cost-plus (or time and
materials basis), and fixed price (or lump sum basis), the final terms and prices of which we frequently negotiate with the customer. Although the terms of our contracts vary considerably, most are made on either a unit price or fixed price basis in
which we agree to do the work for a price per unit of work performed (unit price) or for a fixed amount for the entire project (fixed price). We complete a substantial majority of our fixed price projects, other than certain large transmission
projects, within one year, while we frequently provide maintenance and repair work under open-ended unit price or cost-plus master service agreements that are renewable periodically.

We recognize revenue on our unit price and cost-plus contracts as units are completed or services are performed. For our fixed
price contracts, we record revenues as work on the contract progresses on a percentage-of-completion basis. Under this method, revenue is recognized based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to
complete the contract. Fixed price contracts generally include retainage provisions under which a percentage of the contract price is withheld until the project is complete and has been accepted by our customer.

For internal management purposes, we are organized into three internal divisions, namely, the electric power division, the oil
and gas infrastructure division and the fiber optic licensing division. These internal divisions are closely aligned with the reportable segments described above based on the predominant type of work provided by the operating units within each
division.



Reportable segment information, including revenues and operating income by type
of work, is gathered from each operating unit for the purpose of evaluating segment performance in support of our market strategies. These classifications of our operating unit revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes can at times
require judgment on the part of management. Our operating units may perform joint infrastructure service projects for customers in multiple industries, deliver multiple types of infrastructure services under a single customer contract or provide
services across industries — for example, joint trenching projects to install distribution lines for electric power and natural gas customers. Our integrated operations and common administrative support at each of our operating units requires
that certain allocations, including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs, indirect operating expenses including depreciation, and general and administrative costs, be made to determine operating segment profitability.
Corporate costs, such as payroll and benefits, employee travel expenses, facility costs, professional fees, acquisition costs and amortization related to certain intangible assets are not allocated.

The Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment provides comprehensive network solutions to customers in the electric power
industry. Services performed by the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power transmission and distribution infrastructure and substation facilities
along with other engineering and technical services. This segment also provides emergency restoration services, including the repair of infrastructure damaged by inclement weather, the energized installation, maintenance and upgrade of electric
power infrastructure utilizing unique bare hand and hot stick methods and our proprietary robotic arm technologies, and the installation of “smart grid” technologies on electric power networks. In addition, this segment designs, installs
and maintains renewable energy generation facilities, consisting of solar, wind and certain types of natural gas generation facilities, and related switchyards and transmission infrastructure. To a lesser extent, this segment provides services such
as the construction of electric power generation facilities, the design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, installation of traffic networks and the installation of cable and control systems for light rail
lines.

The Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment provides comprehensive infrastructure solutions to customers
involved in the development and transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline products. Services performed by the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design, installation, repair and maintenance of pipeline
transmission and distribution systems, gathering systems, production systems and compressor and pump stations, as well as related trenching, directional boring and automatic welding services. In addition, this segment’s services include
pipeline protection, integrity testing, rehabilitation and replacement, and fabrication of pipeline support systems and related structures and facilities. We also serve the offshore and inland water energy markets, primarily providing services to
oil and gas exploration platforms, including mechanical installation (or “hook-ups”), electrical and instrumentation, pre-commissioning and commissioning, coatings, fabrication, pipeline construction, integrity services and marine asset
repair. To a lesser extent, this segment designs, installs and maintains airport fueling systems as well as water and sewer infrastructure.

The Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment designs, procures, constructs, maintains and owns fiber optic telecommunications
infrastructure in select markets and licenses the right to use these point-to-point fiber optic telecommunications facilities to our customers pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with terms from five to twenty-five years, inclusive of
certain renewal options. Under those agreements, customers are provided the right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic network, with the network owned and maintained by us. We are also expanding our service offerings to provide lit
services, with Quanta providing network management services to customers, as well as owning the electric equipment necessary to make the fiber optic network operational. We believe market opportunities exist for lit services that will enable us to
leverage capacities of our dark fiber networks, as well as providing other attractive growth opportunities. The Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment provides services to communication carriers as well as education, financial services, healthcare
and other business enterprises with high bandwidth telecommunication needs. The telecommunication services provided through this

segment
are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission and certain state public utility



commissions. The Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment also provides various telecommunication infrastructure services on a limited and ancillary basis, primarily to our customers in the
electric power industry.

Recent Investments, Acquisitions and Divestitures

During 2013, we acquired six businesses, which included electric power and oil and gas infrastructure services companies. The
electric power acquisitions expanded our geographic presence primarily in the Northeastern, Midwestern and Western regions of the United States and in the Central region of Canada, while the oil and gas infrastructure services companies increased
our capacity to provide mechanical installations for the offshore oil and gas industry and pipeline logistics services throughout the United States and expanded our geographic presence to include pipeline construction services in Australia. The
aggregate consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $341.1 million in cash and 3,547,482 shares of our common stock valued, as of the respective dates of issuance, at approximately $88.9 million. The results for each
company have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective dates of acquisition. These acquisitions have enabled us to further enhance our electric power infrastructure service and oil and gas infrastructure
service offerings in the United States and select international markets.

On December 6, 2013, we sold all of our
equity ownership interest in Howard Midstream Energy Partners, LLC (HEP) for proceeds of approximately $220.9 million in cash which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $112.7 million.

In the first and second quarters of 2012, we acquired four businesses, which included one electric power infrastructure
services company based in Canada, two electric power infrastructure services companies based in the United States and one oil and gas infrastructure services company based in the United States. These businesses have been reflected in our
consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $57.5 million in cash, 1,927,113 shares of our common stock valued, as of the respective
dates of acquisition, at approximately $37.3 million and the repayment of $11.0 million in debt. These acquisitions have enabled us to further expand our capabilities and scope of services internationally and in the United States. The financial
results of these businesses are generally included in the corresponding segment.

On December 3, 2012, we sold
substantially all of our domestic telecommunications infrastructure services operations and related subsidiaries.

In the
third and fourth quarters of 2011, we acquired five businesses, which included three electric power infrastructure services companies based in Canada, one electric power infrastructure services company based in the United States and one oil and gas
infrastructure services company based in Australia. These businesses have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions consisted of approximately
$80.8 million in cash, 1,939,813 shares of Quanta common stock valued, as of the respective dates of acquisition, at approximately $32.4 million and the repayment of $3.4 million in debt. These acquisitions have enabled us to further expand our
capabilities and scope of services internationally and in the United States. The financial results of these businesses are generally included in the corresponding segment.

Seasonality; Fluctuations of Results; Economic Conditions

Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced by
weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, project timing and schedules, and holidays. Typically, our revenues are lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or wet conditions can cause delays on projects. In addition,
many of our customers develop their capital budgets for the coming year during the first quarter and do not begin infrastructure projects in a meaningful way until their capital budgets are finalized. Second quarter revenues are typically higher
than those in the first quarter, as some projects begin, but



continued cold and wet weather can often impact second quarter productivity. Third quarter revenues are typically the highest of the year, as a greater number of projects are underway, and
weather is more accommodating. Generally, revenues during the fourth quarter of the year are lower than the third quarter but higher than the second quarter. Many projects are completed in the fourth quarter, and revenues are often impacted
positively by customers seeking to spend their capital budgets before the end of the year; however, the holiday season and inclement weather can sometimes cause delays, reducing revenues and increasing costs. Any quarter may be positively or
negatively affected by atypical weather patterns in a given part of the country, such as severe weather, excessive rainfall or warmer winter weather, making it difficult to predict these variations and their effect on particular projects quarter to
quarter. The timing of project awards and unanticipated changes in project schedules as a result of delays or accelerations can also create variations in the level of operating activity from quarter to quarter.

These seasonal impacts are typical for our U.S. operations, but as our foreign operations continue to grow, we may see a
lessening of this pattern impacting our quarterly revenues. For example, revenues in Canada are often higher in the first quarter as projects are accelerated so that work can be completed prior to the “break up”, as productivity is
adversely affected by wet ground conditions during the warmer spring and summer months. Also, although revenues from Australia and other international operations have not been significant to our overall revenues to date, their seasonal patterns may
differ from those in North America and may impact our seasonality more in the future.

Additionally, our industry can be
highly cyclical. As a result, our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines or delays in new projects in various geographic regions, including the United States, Canada and Australia. Project schedules, particularly in connection with
larger, longer-term projects, can also create fluctuations in the services provided, which may adversely affect us in a given period. The financial condition of our customers and their access to capital, variations in the margins of projects
performed during any particular period, regional, national and global economic and market conditions, timing of acquisitions, the timing and magnitude of acquisition and integration costs associated with acquisitions, dispositions, fluctuations in
our equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets or investments and interest rate fluctuations are examples of items that may also materially affect quarterly results. Accordingly,
our operating results in any particular period may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other period.

We and our customers continue to operate in an uncertain business environment, with heightened regulatory and environmental
requirements, stringent permitting processes and only gradual recovery in the economy from recessionary levels. We are closely monitoring our customers and the effect that changes in economic and market conditions have had or may have on them.
Certain of our customers reduced or delayed spending in recent years, which we attribute primarily to regulatory and permitting hurdles and negative economic and market conditions, and we anticipate that these issues may continue to affect demand
for some of our services in the near-term. However, we believe that most of our customers, many of whom are regulated utilities, remain financially stable in general and will be able to continue with their business plans in the long-term. You should
read “Outlook” and “Understanding Margins” for additional discussion of trends and challenges that may affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Understanding Margins

Our gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues, and our operating margin is operating income expressed
as a percentage of revenues. Cost of services, which is subtracted from revenues to obtain gross profit, consists primarily of salaries, wages and benefits to employees, depreciation, fuel and other equipment expenses, equipment rentals,
subcontracted services, insurance, facilities expenses, materials and parts and supplies. Selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets are then subtracted from gross profit to obtain operating income. Various
factors — some controllable, some not — impact our margins on a quarterly or annual basis.



Seasonal and geographical

. As discussed previously, seasonal patterns
can have a significant impact on margins. Generally, business is slower in the winter months versus the warmer months of the year, resulting in lower productivity and consequently reducing our ability to cover fixed costs. This can be offset
somewhat by increased demand for electrical service and repair work resulting from severe weather. Additionally, project schedules, including when projects begin and when they are completed, may impact margins. The mix of business conducted in
different parts of the country will also affect margins, as some parts of the country offer the opportunity for higher margins than others due to the geographic characteristics associated with the physical location where the work is being performed.
Such characteristics include whether the project is performed in an urban versus a rural setting or in a mountainous area or in open terrain. Site conditions, including unforeseen underground conditions, can also impact margins.

Weather

. Adverse or favorable weather conditions can impact gross margins in a given period. For example, snow or
rainfall in the areas in which we operate may negatively impact our revenues and margins due to reduced productivity, as projects may be delayed or temporarily placed on hold until weather conditions improve. Conversely, in periods when weather
remains dry and temperatures are accommodating, more work can be done, sometimes with less cost, which would have a favorable impact on margins. In some cases, severe weather, such as hurricanes and ice storms, can provide us with higher margin
emergency restoration service work, which generally has a positive impact on margins.

Revenue mix

. The mix of
revenues derived from the industries we serve will impact margins, as certain industries provide higher margin opportunities. Additionally, changes in our customers’ spending patterns in each of the industries we serve can cause an imbalance in
supply and demand and, therefore, affect margins and mix of revenues by industry served.

Service and maintenance
versus installation

. Installation work is often performed on a fixed price basis, while maintenance work is often performed under pre-established or negotiated prices or cost-plus pricing arrangements. Margins for installation work may vary
from project to project, and may be higher than maintenance work, as work obtained on a fixed price basis has higher risk than other types of pricing arrangements. We typically derive approximately 30% of our annual revenues from maintenance work,
but a higher portion of installation work in any given period may affect our gross margins for that period.

Subcontract work

. Work that is subcontracted to other service providers generally yields lower margins. An
increase in subcontract work in a given period may contribute to a decrease in margins. We typically subcontract approximately 20% to 25% of our work to other service providers.

Materials versus labor

. Typically, our customers are responsible for supplying their own materials on projects;
however, for some of our contracts, we may agree to procure all or part of the required materials. Margins may be lower on projects where we furnish a significant amount of materials, as our mark-up on materials is generally lower than on our labor
costs. In a given period, an increase in the percentage of work with higher materials procurement requirements may decrease our overall margins.

Depreciation

. We include depreciation in cost of services. This is common practice in our industry, but it can
make comparability of our margins to those of other companies difficult. This must be taken into consideration when comparing us to other companies.

Insurance.

Margins could be impacted by fluctuations in insurance accruals as additional claims arise and as
circumstances and conditions of existing claims change. We are insured for employer’s liability, general liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation claims. On August 1, 2013, we renewed our employer’s liability, general
liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation policies for the 2013 – 2014 policy year. As a result of the renewal, the deductibles for general liability and auto liability increased from $5.0 million to $10.0 million per occurrence,
while the deductible for workers’ compensation remained at $5.0 million per occurrence and the deductible for employer’s liability remained at $1.0 million per occurrence. We also have employee health care



benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $375,000 per claimant per year.

Performance risk

. Margins may fluctuate because of the volume of work and the impacts of pricing and job
productivity, which can be affected both favorably and negatively by weather, geography, customer decisions and crew productivity. For example, when comparing a service contract between a current quarter and the comparable prior year’s quarter,
factors affecting the gross margins associated with the revenues generated by the contract may include pricing under the contract, the volume of work performed under the contract, the mix of the type of work specifically being performed and the
productivity of the crews performing the work. Productivity can be influenced by many factors, including where the work is performed (e.g., rural versus urban area or mountainous or rocky area versus open terrain), whether the work is on an open or
encumbered right of way, the impacts of inclement weather or the effects of environmental restrictions or regulatory delays. These types of factors are not practicable to quantify through accounting data, but each of these items may individually or
in the aggregate have a direct impact on the gross margin of a specific project.

Foreign currency risk

. Our
financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuation in currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in exchange rates from our operating units with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily our operating
units with Canadian dollar and Australian dollar functional currencies that translate their results into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, could cause material fluctuations in our results of operations.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to management,
administrative salaries and benefits, marketing, office rent and utilities, communications, professional fees, bad debt expense, acquisition costs, gains and losses on the sale of property and equipment, letter of credit fees and maintenance,
training and conversion costs related to the implementation of an information technology solution.

Results of Operations

As previously discussed, we completed the acquisition of six businesses in 2013, four businesses in 2012 and five businesses
during 2011. The results of these acquisitions have been included in the following results of operations beginning on their respective acquisition dates. Additionally, the results of operations of the telecommunications subsidiaries disposed of on
December 3, 2012 have been reclassified from continuing operations to income from discontinued operations for all applicable periods presented. The following table sets forth selected statements of operations data and such data as a percentage
of revenues for the years indicated (dollars in thousands).

Revenues.

Revenues increased $602.6 million, or 10.2%, to $6.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013.
This increase was primarily due to higher revenues from the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment, which increased $334.9 million, or 21.8%, to $1.87 billion, primarily due to increased revenues from pipeline projects related to unconventional
shale developments in certain regions of North America and $167.7 million in revenues generated from companies acquired in 2013. Additionally, revenues from electric power infrastructure services projects increased $274.1 million, or 6.5%, to $4.48
billion primarily as a result of increases in capital spending by our customers and $83.6 million in revenues generated from companies acquired in 2013. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $139.7 million in electric power revenues
from emergency restoration services during 2013 as compared to 2012. Emergency restoration services revenues were higher in 2012 primarily as a result of Hurricane Sandy, which impacted the Northeastern United States in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Gross profit.

Gross profit increased $117.7 million, or 12.6%, to $1.06 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2013. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 15.8% for the year ended December 31, 2012. These increases were primarily due to the impact of higher
revenues and a result of overall performance improvements in the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, which was negatively impacted by
increased project costs as a result of performance issues caused by adverse weather conditions on certain projects that did not recur to the same extent during 2013. These increases were partially offset by the decreased contribution of emergency
restoration services revenues, which typically yield higher margins.



Selling, general and administrative expenses

. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased $66.1 million, or 15.2%, to $501.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to approximately $42.7 million in higher salary and incentive compensation costs
associated with increased levels of operating activity and profitability. Included in this increase in compensation costs was approximately $4.3 million of expense related to the accelerated vesting of equity-based awards associated with the
retirement of our Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors in the second quarter of 2013. Also contributing to the overall increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was approximately $21.3 million in incremental administrative
expenses related to companies acquired in 2013 and $5.1 million in higher costs associated with Quanta’s ongoing technology and business development initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased
from 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2012 to 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013, due to the impact of higher salary and incentive compensation costs previously discussed coupled with the impact from lower levels of emergency
restoration services revenues in 2013 as compared to 2012.

Amortization of intangible assets

. Amortization of
intangible assets decreased $10.2 million to $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to reduced amortization expense from previously acquired intangible assets as certain of these assets became fully
amortized, partially offset by increased amortization of intangibles associated with businesses acquired during 2013.

Interest expense

. Interest expense decreased $1.1 million to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 due to lower levels of borrowings under our credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2013.

Interest income

. Interest income was $3.4 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and
2012. The increase was primarily due to higher average cash balances and interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates

. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was $112.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we sold all of our equity ownership interest in HEP for proceeds of approximately $220.9
million in cash which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $112.7 million.

Provision for income
taxes

. The provision for income taxes was $217.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, with an effective tax rate of 34.1%. The provision for income taxes was $158.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, with an
effective tax rate of 34.2%. The effective tax rates for 2013 and 2012 were primarily impacted by the recording of net tax benefits in the amount of $10.0 million in 2013 and $7.9 million in 2012 associated with decreases in reserves for uncertain
tax positions resulting from the expiration of various federal and state statute of limitation periods and settlement of certain tax audits. Excluding the tax benefits from decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions, the effective tax rates
would have been 35.7% and 35.9% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.

2012 compared to 2011

Revenues

. Revenues increased $1.73 billion, or 41.2%, to $5.92 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012,
primarily due to an increase in the number and size of electric and natural gas transmission projects as a result of overall increases in capital spending by our customers. Electric power infrastructure services revenues increased $1.18 billion, or
39.2%, to $4.21 billion and oil and gas infrastructure services revenues increased $523.5 million, or 51.8%, to $1.53 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Also contributing to the
overall revenue increase was the contribution of $231.6 million in revenues from acquired businesses and an increase of $77.2 million in revenues from emergency restoration services during 2012 as compared to 2011.



Gross profit

. Gross profit increased $376.0 million, or 66.9%, to
$937.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to the impact of higher overall revenues earned across all segments during the current period. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 15.8% for
the year ended December 31, 2012 from 13.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011. Contributing to the increase in gross margin from 2011 to 2012 were overall performance improvements across all segments during the year ended
December 31, 2012. In addition, the higher revenues earned during the current period also enhanced our ability to cover operating overhead costs. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011 was also negatively impacted by a $32.6
million charge to the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment’s cost of services which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011 in connection with the withdrawal of certain of our subsidiaries from an underfunded multi-employer pension plan.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $97.1
million, or 28.7%, to $434.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily attributable to $50.0 million in higher salary and benefits costs associated with higher personnel and incentive compensation expenses as a
result of current levels of operating activity and profitability, $14.7 million in higher professional fees primarily associated with certain legal matters, business development initiatives and ongoing technological development costs and a $3.7
million increase in bad debt expense. Also contributing to the overall increase were $17.5 million in additional administrative expenses associated with acquired companies. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues
decreased from 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2011 to 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to the impact of higher overall revenues described above.

Amortization of intangible assets

. Amortization of intangible assets increased $8.7 million to $37.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to increased amortization of intangibles associated with businesses acquired during 2012 and the end of 2011, partially offset by reduced amortization expense from previously
acquired intangible assets as certain of these assets became fully amortized.

Interest expense

. Interest expense
increased $1.9 million to $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to higher levels of borrowings under our credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2011. The increase was partially offset by lower average cash balances during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.

Interest income

. Interest income increased $0.4 million to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
This increase was primarily due to higher interest rates earned for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was partially offset by lower average cash balances during the year ended
December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated
affiliates.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to none for the year ended December 31, 2011. This primarily related to our investment in HEP.

Provision for income taxes

. The provision for income taxes was $158.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2012, with an effective tax rate of 34.2%. The provision for income taxes was $63.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, with an effective tax rate of 32.6%. The effective tax rates for 2012 and 2011 were impacted by the recording of
tax benefits in the amount of $7.9 million in 2012 and $8.4 million in 2011 associated with decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of various federal and state statute of limitations periods and settlement of
certain tax audits. Excluding the tax benefits from decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions, the effective tax rates would have been 35.9% and 37.0% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. After excluding the tax benefits
recorded, the lower effective tax rate in 2012 was primarily due to a higher proportion of income from continuing operations earned from international jurisdictions which are taxed at lower statutory rates.

Electric Power Infrastructure Services Segment Results

Revenues for this segment increased $274.1 million, or 6.5%, to $4.48 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013.
Revenues were positively impacted by increased activity in electric power transmission and distribution projects, which resulted primarily from increased capital spending by our customers. Revenues in 2013 were also favorably impacted by the
additional contribution of approximately $83.6 million in revenues from companies acquired in 2013. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in revenues from emergency restoration services, which decreased approximately $139.7 million to
approximately $110.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Emergency restoration services revenues were higher in 2012 primarily as a result of Hurricane Sandy, which impacted the
Northeastern United States in the fourth quarter of 2012. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 were also negatively impacted by lower revenues related to renewable energy projects due to decreased capital spending by our customers
primarily as a result of a change in the tax incentives associated with these types of projects.

Operating income
increased $1.0 million, or 0.2%, to $521.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, while operating income as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 12.4% for the year ended
December 31, 2012. Operating income was positively impacted in 2013 by higher overall levels of infrastructure service revenues. However, these increases were substantially offset by lower levels of operating income contributed from emergency
restoration services revenues in 2013 as compared to 2012, which typically yield higher margins.

Oil and Gas
Infrastructure Services Segment Results

Revenues for this segment increased $334.9 million, or 21.8%, to $1.87
billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to an increase in revenues from pipeline projects related to unconventional shale developments in certain regions of North America.
Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 were also favorably impacted by approximately $167.7 million in revenues from companies acquired in 2013.



Operating income increased $83.1 million to $138.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013 from $55.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Operating income as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 3.6% for the year ended December 31,
2012. These increases were primarily due to continued performance improvements in project execution and the overall increase in segment revenues described above, which improved this segment’s ability to cover fixed and overhead costs. Operating
margins for the year ended December 31, 2012 were negatively impacted by increased project costs as a result of performance issues caused by adverse weather conditions on certain projects which did not recur to the same extent during 2013.

Fiber Optic Licensing and Other Segment Results

Revenues for this segment decreased $6.5 million, or 3.6%, to $172.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This
decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in revenues related to ancillary telecommunications and wireless infrastructure projects, partially offset by increased revenues from the installation of a statewide fiber optic network in
Pennsylvania and from increased licensing of point-to-point fiber optic telecommunications facilities as a result of our continued network expansion activities.

Operating income decreased $5.9 million, or 9.6%, to $55.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating income
as a percentage of segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased to 32.1% compared to 34.2% for the year ended December 31, 2012. These decreases were primarily due to a $3.2 million charge associated with a revised
assessment of state gross receipts tax requirements on fiber optic licensing revenues as a result of a recent industry related legal proceeding, as well as higher network maintenance costs during 2013, startup costs for new lit service offerings,
and the decrease in segment revenues described above.

Corporate and Non-allocated Costs

Certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets are not allocated to segments.
Corporate and non-allocated costs for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $16.5 million to $188.9 million. Contributing to this increase was approximately $24.8 million in higher salary and incentive compensation costs associated with
increased levels of operating activity and profitability. Included in this increase in compensation costs was approximately $4.3 million of expense related to the accelerated vesting of equity-based awards associated with the retirement of our
Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors in the second quarter of 2013. Also contributing to the increase was approximately $4.6 million in higher acquisition and integration costs and $2.7 million in costs associated with our ongoing technology
and business development initiatives. Partially offsetting these increases was a $10.2 million decrease in amortization expense as previously acquired intangible assets became fully amortized, partially offset by amortization expense related to 2013
acquisitions.

2012 compared to 2011

Electric Power Infrastructure Services Segment Results

Revenues for this segment increased $1.18 billion, or 39.2%, to $4.21 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012.
Revenues were positively impacted by increased revenues from electric power transmission projects and solar power generation projects as a result of increased capital spending by our customers. Revenues in 2012 were also favorably impacted by the
contribution of approximately $201.3 million in revenues from acquired companies. Also contributing to the increase was a $77.2 million increase in revenues from emergency restoration services, primarily resulting from Hurricane Sandy, which
impacted the Northeastern United States in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Operating income increased $183.1 million, or
54.2%, to $520.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Operating income as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 12.4% for the year ended



December 31, 2012 from 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2011. These increases were primarily due to the overall increase in segment revenues described above, which improved this
segment’s ability to cover fixed and overhead costs, as well as higher margins earned on certain major transmission projects ongoing during 2012. The increase in operating margins was partially offset by the completion of certain higher margin
solar power generation projects in 2011.

Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Segment Results

Revenues for this segment increased $523.5 million, or 51.8%, to $1.53 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. The
increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number and size of pipeline transmission projects primarily related to unconventional shale developments in certain regions of North America. Revenues from distribution services also
increased during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of the incremental contribution of revenues from certain new master service agreements, as well as increased spending
by our customers in certain regions of the United States. Revenues were also favorably impacted by the contribution of approximately $30.3 million in revenues from acquired companies.

Operating income increased $133.7 million, or 170.8%, to $55.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 from an
operating loss of $78.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Operating income as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 3.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012 from a negative 7.7% for the year ended December 31,
2011. Operating margins in 2011 were negatively impacted by increased costs resulting from performance issues on certain gas transmission projects completed during the first quarter of 2011 associated with adverse weather conditions and regulatory
restrictions. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011 was also negatively impacted by a $32.6 million charge to this segment’s results in connection with the withdrawal of certain of our subsidiaries from an underfunded
multi-employer pension plan. Operating income as a percentage of revenues in 2012 also increased as a result of the overall increase in segment revenues during 2012, which improved this segment’s ability to cover operating overhead and
administrative costs.

Fiber Optic Licensing and Other Segment Results

Revenues for this segment increased $19.2 million, or 12.0%, to $179.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The
increase in revenues was primarily due to increased spending on ancillary telecommunications and wireless infrastructure projects by customers operating within the electric power energy industry.

Operating income increased $7.8 million, or 14.6%, to $61.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Operating
income as a percentage of segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 remained relatively constant at 34.2% compared to 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Corporate and Non-allocated Costs

Certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets are not allocated to segments.
Corporate and non-allocated costs for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased $54.4 million to $172.4 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $28.4 million associated with higher personnel and incentive compensation costs
associated with current levels of operating activity, an increase of $8.7 million in amortization expense, an increase of $7.6 million in professional fees associated with ongoing technology development costs, business development initiatives and
legal matters and a $2.8 million increase in bad debt expense.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Requirements

Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $488.8 million as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, cash
and cash equivalents held in domestic bank accounts were approximately $236.7 million and $254.1 million, and cash and cash equivalents held in foreign bank accounts were approximately $252.1 million and $140.6 million, primarily in Canada and
Australia.

We were in compliance with our covenants under our credit facility at December 31, 2013. We anticipate
that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, existing borrowing capacity under our credit facility, and our future cash flows from operations will provide sufficient funds to enable us to meet our future operating needs and our planned capital
expenditures, as well as facilitate our ability to grow in the foreseeable future.

Our industry is capital intensive, and
we expect the need for substantial capital expenditures to continue into the foreseeable future to meet the anticipated demand for our services. Capital expenditures are expected to total $300 million to $325 million for 2014. Approximately $50
million to $60 million of the expected 2014 capital expenditures are targeted for the expansion of our fiber optic networks.

We also evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions from time to time that may require cash, as well as opportunities to
make investments in customer-sponsored projects where we anticipate performing services such as project management, engineering, procurement or construction services. These investment opportunities exist in the markets and industries we serve and
may require the use of cash in the form of debt or equity investments.

Management continues to monitor the financial
markets and general national and global economic conditions. We consider our cash investment policies to be conservative in that we maintain a diverse portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality cash investments with short-term maturities.
Accordingly, we do not anticipate that any weakness in the capital markets will have a material impact on the principal amounts of our cash investments or our ability to rely upon our existing credit facility for funds. To date, we have experienced
no loss of or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents or funds under our credit facility; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents or availability under our credit facility will not be
impacted in the future by adverse conditions in the financial markets.

Through December 31, 2013, we have not
provided U.S. income taxes on approximately $218.0 million of unremitted foreign earnings because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. It is not practicable to determine the amount of any additional
U.S. tax liability that may result if we decide to no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings outside the U.S. If our intentions or U.S. tax laws change in the future, there may be a significant negative impact on the provision for income
taxes and cash flows, as a result of recording an incremental tax liability, in the period such change occurs.

Sources and Uses of Cash

As of December 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $488.8 million and working capital of $1.27 billion. We also
had $240.3 million of letters of credit outstanding and no revolving loans outstanding under our credit facility, with $1.08 billion available for borrowing or issuing new letters of credit under our credit facility.

Operating Activities

Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our services and operating margins but can also be influenced
by working capital needs associated with the various types of services that we provide. In particular, working capital needs may increase when we commence large volumes of work under circumstances where project costs, primarily associated with
labor, equipment and subcontractors, are required to be paid before the receivables resulting from the work performed are billed and collected. Working capital needs are generally higher during the summer and fall months due to increased demand for
our services when favorable weather



conditions exist in many of the regions in which we operate. Conversely, working capital assets are typically converted to cash during the winter months. These seasonal trends can be offset by
changes in the timing of major projects which can be impacted by project delays or accelerations and other economic factors that may affect customer spending.

Operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of $446.6 million during 2013 as compared to $166.8 million
during 2012 and $204.1 million during 2011. The increase in cash flows for operating activities from continuing operations for 2013 as compared to 2012 and 2011 was primarily a result of the collections on receivables during the first quarter of
2013 attributable to significantly higher levels of emergency restoration services provided in the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 and decreased working capital requirements in 2013 as compared to 2012. The higher
working capital requirements in 2012 were primarily due to the ramp up of multiple large electric transmission projects and more emergency restoration services projects, primarily as a result of Hurricane Sandy, which impacted the Northeastern
United States in the fourth quarter of 2012. Also contributing to the increase in cash from operating activities from continuing operations were overall improved operating results in 2013 and 2012 as compared to 2011.

Investing Activities

During 2013, we used net cash in investing activities from continuing operations of $320.0 million as compared to $321.1
million and $272.3 million used in investing activities in 2012 and 2011. Investing activities from continuing operations in 2013 included $263.6 million used for capital expenditures, $283.8 million used in connection with acquisitions and $10.0
million used for other investments (primarily comprised of the capital lease of an internally constructed electric power transmission asset). These amounts were partially offset by investments in and return on equity from unconsolidated affiliates
of $186.2 million, which includes gross proceeds from the sale of all of our equity ownership in HEP of approximately $220.9 million, the release of $36.5 million of restricted cash balances associated with a newly acquired company, and $14.8
million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. Investing activities from continuing operations in 2012 included $209.4 million used for capital expenditures, partially offset by $12.4 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. Additionally,
investing activities from continuing operations in 2012 included $68.7 million used in connection with business acquisitions and $53.8 million used in equity investment contributions, primarily to HEP. Investing activities from continuing operations
in 2011 included $162.3 million used for capital expenditures, $79.7 million used in connection with business acquisitions and a $35.0 million capital contribution to acquire an initial equity interest in HEP, partially offset by $9.1 million of
proceeds from the sale of equipment.

Our industry is capital intensive, and we expect the need for substantial capital
expenditures to continue into the foreseeable future to meet the anticipated demand for our services. In addition, we expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments, although we cannot predict the timing or magnitude of the
potential cash outlays for these initiatives.

Financing Activities

During 2013, net cash used by financing activities from continuing operations was $16.7 million as compared to cash used by
financing activities of $15.3 million and $158.7 million in 2012 and 2011. Financing activities from continuing operations during 2013 included $17.6 million of cash payments to noncontrolling interests as distributions of joint venture profits,
$3.2 million of loan costs related to the amendment and restatement of our credit facility on October 30, 2013 and the positive impact of $3.7 million related to the tax impact of stock-based equity awards. Financing activities from continuing
operations in 2012 included $18.0 million in cash payments to noncontrolling interests as distributions of joint venture profits. Financing activities from continuing operations in 2011 primarily related to $149.5 million in common stock repurchases
under our stock repurchase program, $6.0 million of cash payments to noncontrolling interests as distribution of joint venture profits as well as $4.1 million of loan costs related to the amendment and restatement of our credit facility on
August 2, 2011.



Debt Instruments

Credit Facility

On October 30, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement which amended and restated our prior credit agreement with various
lenders. The credit agreement provides for a $1.325 billion senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on October 30, 2018. Up to $400.0 million of the facility is available for revolving loans and letters of credit in certain
alternative currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar. The entire amount of the facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Up to $50.0 million of the facility is available for swing line loans in U.S. dollars, up to $30.0 million
of the facility is available for swing line loans in Canadian dollars and up to $20.0 million of the facility is available for swing line loans in Australian dollars. In addition, subject to the conditions specified in the credit agreement, we have
the option to increase the revolving commitments under the credit agreement by up to an additional $300.0 million from time to time upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Borrowings under the credit agreement are to be
used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $240.3 million of letters of credit issued, $184.2 million of which was
denominated in U.S. dollars and $56.1 million of which was denominated in Australian and Canadian dollars, and no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. The remaining $1.08 billion was available for borrowings or issuing new letters of
credit.

Prior to April 1, 2014, amounts borrowed under the credit agreement in U.S. dollars bear interest, at our
option, at a rate equal to either (a) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 1.25%, or (b) the Base Rate (as described below) plus 0.25%. Amounts borrowed as revolving loans under the credit agreement in any
currency other than U.S. dollars bear interest at a rate equal to the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.25%. Standby letters of credit issued under the credit agreement are subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.25%, and Performance Letters of Credit (as
defined in the credit agreement) issued under the credit agreement in support of certain contractual obligations are subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.75%. We are also subject to a commitment fee of 0.20% on any unused availability under the
credit agreement.

Effective April 1, 2014, amounts borrowed under the credit agreement in U.S. dollars will bear
interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (a) the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.125% to 2.125%, as determined based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as described below), or (b) the Base Rate plus 0.125% to 1.125%, as determined
based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Amounts borrowed as revolving loans under the credit agreement in any currency other than U.S. dollars will bear interest at a rate equal to the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.125% to 2.125%, as determined based
on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Standby letters of credit issued under the credit agreement will be subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.125% to 2.125%, based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, and Performance Letters of Credit issued under
the credit agreement in support of certain contractual obligations will be subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.675% to 1.275%, based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio. We also will be subject to a commitment fee of 0.20% to 0.40%, based on our
Consolidated Leverage Ratio, on any unused availability under the credit agreement.

The Consolidated Leverage Ratio is
the ratio of our Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement). For purposes of calculating the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Funded Indebtedness is reduced by available cash and Cash
Equivalents (as defined in the credit agreement) in excess of $25.0 million. The Base Rate equals the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 1/2 of 1%, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate and
(iii) the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.00%.

Subject to certain exceptions, the credit agreement is secured by
substantially all of our assets and the assets of our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries and by a pledge of all of the capital stock of our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of our direct foreign subsidiaries of our wholly
owned U.S. subsidiaries. Our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries also guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the credit agreement. Subject to certain conditions, at any time we maintain an Investment Grade Rating (defined in the credit



agreement as two of the following three conditions being met: (i) a corporate credit rating that is BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, (ii) a corporate
family rating that is Baa3 or higher by Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. or (iii) a corporate credit rating that is BBB- or higher by Fitch Ratings, Inc.), all collateral will automatically be released from these liens.

The credit agreement contains certain covenants, including a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and a Consolidated Interest
Coverage Ratio, in each case as specified in the credit agreement. The credit agreement limits certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, indebtedness, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits
liens on assets. The credit agreement also allows for cash payments for dividends and stock repurchases subject to compliance with the following requirements on a post-incurrence basis: (i) no default or event of default under the credit agreement;
(ii) continued compliance with the financial covenants described above; and (iii) at least $100 million of availability under the credit agreement and/or cash and cash equivalents on hand. As of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all
of the covenants in the credit agreement.

The credit agreement provides for customary events of default and carries
cross-default provisions with our underwriting, continuing indemnity and security agreement with its sureties and all of our other debt instruments exceeding $75.0 million in borrowings or availability. If an Event of Default (as defined in the
credit agreement) occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the credit agreement, amounts outstanding under the credit agreement may be accelerated and may become or be declared immediately due and payable.

Between April 2, 2011 and October 30, 2013, we had a credit agreement that provided for a $700.0 million senior
secured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of August 2, 2016. The entire amount of the facility was available for the issuance of letters of credit. Borrowings under the credit agreement were to be used to refinance existing
indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.

Amounts borrowed under
the credit agreement in U.S. dollars bore interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (a) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 1.25% to 2.50%, as determined based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as
described below), plus, if applicable, any Mandatory Cost (as defined in the credit agreement) required to compensate lenders for the cost of compliance with certain European regulatory requirements, or (b) the Base Rate (as described below)
plus 0.25% to 1.50%, as determined based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Amounts borrowed under the credit agreement in any currency other than U.S. dollars bore interest at a rate equal to the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.25% to 2.50%, as
determined based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, plus, if applicable, any Mandatory Cost. Standby letters of credit issued under the credit agreement were subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.25% to 2.50%, based on our Consolidated Leverage
Ratio, and Performance Letters of Credit (as defined in the credit agreement) issued under the credit agreement in support of certain contractual obligations were subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.75% to 1.50%, based on our Consolidated
Leverage Ratio. We were also subject to a commitment fee of 0.20% to 0.45%, based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, on any unused availability under the credit agreement. The Consolidated Leverage Ratio was the ratio of our total funded debt to
Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement). For purposes of calculating both the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and the maximum senior debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio discussed below, total funded debt and total senior debt were reduced
by all cash and Cash Equivalents (as defined in the credit agreement) held by us in excess of $25.0 million. The Base Rate equaled the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 1/2 of 1%, (ii) Bank of
America’s prime rate and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.00%.

Prior to August 2, 2011, we had a credit
agreement that provided for a $475.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing September 19, 2012. Subject to the conditions specified in the prior credit agreement, borrowings under the prior credit facility were to be used for
working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The entire unused portion of the prior credit facility was available for the issuance of letters of credit.



Amounts borrowed under the prior credit facility bore interest, at our option, at
a rate equal to either (a) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the prior credit agreement) plus 0.875% to 1.75%, as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the prior credit agreement), or
(b) the base rate (as described below) plus 0.00% to 0.75%, as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA. Letters of credit issued under the prior credit facility were subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.875% to
1.75%, based on the ratio of our total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA. We were also subject to a commitment fee of 0.15% to 0.35%, based on the ratio of our total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA, on any unused availability under the prior
credit facility. The base rate equaled the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the prior credit agreement) plus 1/2 of 1% or (ii) the bank’s prime rate.

Off-Balance Sheet Transactions

As is common in our industry, we have entered into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business
that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets. Our significant off-balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with non-cancelable operating leases, letter of credit obligations, commitments to expand our fiber
optic networks, commitments to purchase equipment, surety guarantees, certain multi-employer pension plan liabilities and obligations relating to our joint venture arrangements. Certain joint venture structures involve risks not directly reflected
in our balance sheets. For certain joint ventures, we have guaranteed all of the obligations of the joint venture under a contract with the customer. Additionally, other joint venture arrangements qualify as a general partnership, for which we are
jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of the joint venture. In our joint venture arrangements, typically each joint venturer indemnifies the other party for any liabilities incurred in excess of the liabilities such other party is
obligated to bear under the respective joint venture agreement. Other than as previously discussed, we have not engaged in any material off-balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities, and we have no material guarantees of
the work or obligations of third parties.

Leases

We enter into non-cancelable operating leases for many of our facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow us to
conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them. We may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term, in which case we are typically liable to the
lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease.

We have guaranteed the residual value of the
underlying assets under certain of our equipment operating leases at the date of termination of such leases. We have agreed to pay any difference between this residual value and the fair market value of each underlying asset as of the lease
termination date. As of December 31, 2013, the maximum guaranteed residual value was approximately $304.8 million. We believe that no significant payments will be made as a result of the difference between the fair market value of the leased
equipment and the guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no assurance that future significant payments will not be required.

Letters of Credit

Certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf, such as
to beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance programs. In addition, from time to time, certain customers require us to post letters of credit to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts and to guarantee performance
under our contracts. Such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution, typically pursuant to our credit facility. Each letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of
credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions. If this were to occur, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement, we may also be
required to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. We do not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future.



As of December 31, 2013, we had $240.3 million in letters of credit
outstanding under our credit facility primarily to secure obligations under our casualty insurance program. These are irrevocable stand-by letters of credit with maturities generally expiring at various times throughout 2014. Upon maturity, it is
expected that the majority of these letters of credit will be renewed for subsequent one-year periods.

Performance
Bonds and Parent Guarantees

Many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post
performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety. These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to
perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs. Under our underwriting,
continuing indemnity and security agreement with our sureties and with the consent of our lenders under our credit facility, we have granted security interests in certain of our assets to collateralize our obligations to the sureties. Subject to
certain conditions and consistent with terms of our credit facility, these security interests will be automatically released if we maintain a corporate credit rating that is BBB- (stable) or higher by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services
and a corporate family rating that is Baa3 (stable) or higher by Moody’s Investors Services. We may be required to post letters of credit or other collateral in favor of the sureties or our customers in the future. Posting letters of credit in
favor of the sureties or our customers would reduce the borrowing availability under our credit facility. To date, we have not been required to make any reimbursements to our sureties for bond-related costs. We believe that it is unlikely that we
will have to fund significant claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2013, the total amount of outstanding performance bonds was approximately $2.68 billion, and the estimated cost to complete these
bonded projects was approximately $671.4 million.

From time to time, we guarantee the obligations of our wholly owned
subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease obligations, certain joint venture arrangements and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors’ licenses. We are not aware of
any material obligations for performance or payment asserted against us under any of these guarantees.

The committed capital expenditures for fiber optic networks represent commitments related to
signed contracts with customers. The amounts are estimates of costs required to build the networks under contract. The actual capital expenditures related to building the networks could vary materially from these estimates. We have also committed
capital for the expansion of our vehicle fleet in order to accommodate manufacturer lead times on



certain types of vehicles. As of December 31, 2013, production orders for approximately $13.7 million had been issued with delivery dates occurring throughout 2014. Although we have
committed to the purchase of these vehicles at the time of their delivery, we intend that these orders will be assigned to third party leasing companies and made available to us under certain of our master equipment lease agreements, which will
release us from our capital commitment.

As of December 31, 2013, the total unrecognized tax benefits related to
uncertain tax positions was $48.8 million. Although the Internal Revenue Service completed its examination related to calendar year 2010 during 2013, certain of our subsidiaries remain under examination by various state and Canadian tax authorities
for multiple periods, and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could therefore increase or decrease as a result of the expiration of certain statute of limitations periods or settlements of these audits. We believe it is reasonably possible that
within the next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits may decrease up to $6.7 million due to the expiration of certain statute of limitations periods or settlements of the audits.

The previously presented table of estimated contractual obligations does not reflect the majority of the obligations under the
multi-employer pension plans in which our union employees participate. Some of our operating units are parties to various collective bargaining agreements that require us to provide to the employees subject to these agreements specified wages and
benefits, as well as to make contributions to multi-employer pension plans. Our multi-employer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in the collective bargaining agreements (usually on an annual basis), and contributions are made
to the plans on a “pay-as-you-go” basis based on our union employee payrolls. Our obligations for contributions to multi-employer pension plans cannot be determined for future periods because the location and number of union employees that
we have employed at any given time and the plans in which they may participate vary depending on the projects we have ongoing at any time and the need for union resources in connection with those projects.

We may also have additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of our participation in multi-employer defined benefit
pension plans. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors to a multi-employer plan if the employer
withdraws from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. These liabilities include an allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits in the plan for all plan participants, not merely the benefits payable to a contributing
employer’s own retirees. Other than as noted below, we are not aware of any material amounts of withdrawal liability that have been or are expected to be incurred as a result of a withdrawal by any of our operating units from any multi-employer
defined benefit pension plans.

We may also be required to make additional contributions to our multi-employer pension
plans if they become underfunded, and these additional contributions will be determined based on our union employee payrolls. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added special funding and operational rules generally applicable to plan years beginning
after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding
improvement or rehabilitation plan, as applicable, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. A number of multi-employer plans
to which our operating units contribute or may contribute in the future are in “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status. The amount of additional funds, if any, that we may be obligated to contribute to
these plans in the future cannot be reasonably estimated and is not included in the above table due to uncertainty of the future levels of work that require the specific use of the union employees covered by these plans, as well as the future
contribution levels and possible surcharges on contributions applicable to these plans.

We recorded a partial withdrawal
liability of approximately $32.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the withdrawal by certain of our subsidiaries from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (the Central States Plan). The partial withdrawal
liability we recognized was based on estimates received from the Central States Plan during 2011 for a complete withdrawal by all of our subsidiaries



participating in the Central States Plan. During the third quarter of 2012, the Central States Plan provided additional estimates of the potential withdrawal liability, indicating that the
withdrawal liability would be approximately $32.8 million based on a partial withdrawal in the fourth quarter of 2011, approximately $39.7 million based on a partial withdrawal in the first quarter of 2012, or approximately $40.1 million based upon
a complete withdrawal in 2012. Certain of our subsidiaries continued participation in the Central States Plan, and we subsequently effected a complete withdrawal as of December 31, 2012. The consequences of the complete withdrawal of our
subsidiaries from the plan will depend on various factors, including interpretations of the terms of the collective bargaining agreements under which the subsidiaries participated and whether exemptions from withdrawal liability applicable to
construction industry employers will be available. Based on the previous estimates of liability associated with a complete withdrawal from the Central States Plan, and allowing for the exclusion of amounts we believe have been improperly included in
such estimate, we will seek to challenge and further negotiate the amount owed in connection with this matter. In December 2013, Central States filed a lawsuit against certain of our subsidiaries alleging that contributions made to a new industry
fund, which was created after we withdrew from the Central States Plan, should have been made to the Central States Plan. We have disputed these allegations on the basis that we have properly provided contributions to the new industry fund based on
the terms of the collective bargaining agreements under which our subsidiaries participate. Given the unknown nature of some of these factors, the final withdrawal liability cannot yet be determined with certainty; therefore, such amount could be
materially higher than the $32.6 million we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2011. As a result of these various factors, the estimated partial withdrawal liability of $32.6 million has not been included in the Contractual Obligations table. For
additional information regarding the partial withdrawal liability, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Additionally, on October 9, 2013, we acquired a company that experienced a complete withdrawal from the Central States
Plan prior to the date of our acquisition. Central States issued a notice and demand, dated March 13, 2013, to the acquired company for a withdrawal liability in the total amount of $6.9 million payable in installments. Based on legal
arguments, the acquired company took the position that the amount of withdrawal liability payable to Central States as a result of its complete withdrawal was $4.8 million, of which approximately $4.3 million remained outstanding as of
December 31, 2013. The acquired company, and now Quanta, has taken steps to challenge the amount of the assessment by the Central States Plan; however, payments in accordance with the terms of the Central States demand letter are required
to be made while the dispute process is ongoing. Accordingly, the $4.3 million is included in the previously presented table of contractual obligations. In addition, $2.1 million of the cash proceeds related to the sale were deposited into an escrow
account on October 9, 2013 to fund any additional obligation beyond the $4.8 million. Accordingly, the acquired company’s withdrawal from the Central States Plan is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows.

Also excluded from the Contractual Obligations table is interest associated with letters of
credit fees and commitment fees under our credit facility because the outstanding letters of credit, availability and applicable interest rates and fees are variable. For additional information regarding the interest rates under our credit facility,
see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

We have also excluded from the Contractual Obligations table additional capital commitments associated with
investments in unconsolidated affiliates related to planned midstream infrastructure projects of approximately $13.1 million because we are unable to determine the timing of these capital commitments but anticipate them to be paid before the end of
2015.

Self-Insurance

We are insured for employer’s liability, general liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation claims. On
August 1, 2013, we renewed our employer’s liability, general liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation policies for the 2013 – 2014 policy year. As a result of the renewal, the deductibles for general liability and auto
liability increased from $5.0 million to $10.0 million per occurrence, while the deductible for



workers’ compensation remained at $5.0 million per occurrence and the deductible for employer’s liability remained at $1.0 million per occurrence. Additionally, in connection with this
renewal, the amount of letters of credit required by us to secure our obligations under our casualty insurance programs has increased. We also have employee health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining
agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $375,000 per claimant per year.

Losses under all of
these insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to
assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known
facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the gross amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $161.8 million and $160.8 million, with $122.6 million and $120.2 million
considered to be long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Related insurance recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $9.1 million and $22.2 million, of which $0.7 million and $2.3 million are included in
prepaid expenses and other current assets and $8.4 million and $19.9 million are included in other assets, net.

We renew
our insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel our coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or we may elect
not to obtain certain types or incremental levels of insurance if we believe that the cost to obtain such coverage exceeds the additional benefits obtained. In any such event, our overall risk exposure would increase, which could negatively affect
our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Concentration of Credit Risk

We are subject to concentrations of credit risk related primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and our accounts receivable,
including amounts related to unbilled accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. Substantially all of our cash investments are managed by what we believe to be high credit quality financial
institutions. In accordance with our investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest this cash in a diversified portfolio of what we believe to be high quality investments, which primarily include interest-bearing demand deposits,
money market mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper with original maturities of three months or less. Although we do not currently believe the principal amount of these investments is subject to any material risk of loss, changes in
economic conditions could impact the interest income we receive from these investments. In addition, we grant credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, to our customers, which include electric power, oil and gas companies,
governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the United States and Canada. Consequently, we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in
business and economic factors throughout the United States and Canada, which may be heightened as a result of uncertain economic and financial market conditions that have existed in recent years. However, we generally have certain statutory lien
rights with respect to services provided. Historically, some of our customers have experienced significant financial difficulties, and others may experience financial difficulties in the future. These difficulties expose us to increased risk related
to collectability of billed and unbilled receivables and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts for services we have performed.

As of December 31, 2013, two customers accounted for approximately 15% and 11% of our consolidated net position, which
includes accounts receivable (including long-term balances and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts), less billings in excess of costs and unearned revenue. As of December 31, 2012, the same two customers
accounted for approximately 16% and 11% of consolidated net position. The services provided to these customers relate primarily to our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. Substantially all of the balance for the customer with 11% of
consolidated net position at December 31, 2013 and 2012 relates to the Sunrise Powerlink project with a long-term receivable balance related to a



significant change order that is subject to a contractually agreed upon arbitration process. During the third quarter of 2013, we reclassified the receivable related to this matter from costs in
excess of billings on uncompleted contracts to other assets, net due to the expected timetable for resolution of the matter. For additional information, see

Litigation and Claims — Sunrise Powerlink Arbitration

in Note 15 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, the customer with the 11% of consolidated net position at December 31, 2013 and 2012 also accounted for 11% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. No other customers
represented 10% or more of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, and no other customers represented 10% or more of consolidated net position as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.

Litigation and Claims

We are from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract and/or property damages, employment-related damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or
declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record a reserve when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we disclose matters for which
management believes a material loss is at least reasonably possible. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”

for additional information
regarding litigation and claims.

Related Party Transactions

In the normal course of business, we enter into transactions from time to time with related parties. These transactions
typically take the form of facility leases with prior owners of certain acquired companies.

Inflation

Due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, inflation
did not have a significant effect on our results.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

On January 1, 2013, we adopted an update that gives entities an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine
whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that its indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If, based on its qualitative assessment, an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that
the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying amount, quantitative impairment testing is required. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, quantitative impairment testing is not required. The adoption of
this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Standards Not Yet
Adopted

In July 2013, the FASB issued an update that provides guidance on the balance sheet presentation of an
unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforward exists as of the reporting date. The update is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning
after December 15, 2013. Retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this authoritative guidance on our consolidated financial statements and are planning to adopt this guidance effective
January 1, 2014.



Critical Accounting Policies

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are published and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods
presented. We review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on our beliefs and
assumptions derived from information available at the time such judgments and estimates are made. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements. There can be no assurance that
actual results will not differ from those estimates. Management has reviewed its development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following accounting policies affect our
more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

Revenue
Recognition

Infrastructure Services

— Through our Electric Power Infrastructure Services and Oil and
Gas Infrastructure Services segments, we design, install and maintain networks for customers in the electric power and oil and gas industries. These services may be provided pursuant to master service agreements, repair and maintenance contracts and
fixed price and non-fixed price installation contracts. Pricing under these contracts may be competitive unit price, cost-plus/hourly (or time and materials basis) or fixed price (or lump sum basis), and the final terms and prices of these contracts
are frequently negotiated with the customer. Under unit-based contracts, the utilization of an output-based measurement is appropriate for revenue recognition. Under these contracts, we recognize revenue as units are completed based on pricing
established between us and the customer for each unit of delivery, which best reflects the pattern in which the obligation to the customer is fulfilled. Under our cost-plus/hourly and time and materials type contracts, we recognize revenue on an
input basis, as labor hours are incurred and services are performed.

Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized
using the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract. These contracts provide for a fixed amount of revenues for the entire project. Such contracts provide that
the customer accept completion of progress to date and compensate us for services rendered, which may be measured in terms of units installed, hours expended or some other measure of progress. Contract costs include all direct materials, labor and
subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Much of the material associated with our work is owner-furnished and is therefore not included in
contract revenues and costs. The cost estimation process is based on professional knowledge and experience of our engineers, project managers and financial professionals. Changes in job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are
factors that influence management’s assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts and therefore, our profit recognition. Changes in these factors may result in revisions to costs and income, and
their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. These factors are routinely evaluated on a project by project basis throughout the project term, and the impact of corresponding revisions in management’s
estimates of contract value, contract cost and contract profit are recorded as necessary in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined
to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If actual results significantly differ from our estimates used for revenue recognition and claim assessments, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted.
Our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2013 were impacted by less than 5% as a result of changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress at December 31, 2012.



The current asset “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on
uncompleted contracts” represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed for fixed price contracts. The current liability “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in
excess of revenues recognized for fixed price contracts.

We may incur costs subject to change orders, whether approved or
unapproved by the customer, and/or claims related to certain contracts. We determine the probability that such costs will be recovered based upon evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific discussions or preliminary negotiations
with the customer or verbal approvals. We treat items as a cost of contract performance in the period incurred if it is not probable that the costs will be recovered or will recognize revenue if it is probable that the contract price will be
adjusted and can be reliably estimated. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had approximately $241.8 million and $205.0 million of change orders and/or claims that had been included as contract price adjustments on certain contracts which were
in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business. The December 31, 2013 and 2012 balances of recognized change orders and claims included a change order from the Sunrise Powerlink project, an electric power infrastructure
services project, primarily as a result of multiple customer-directed changes to the construction schedule which required PAR Electrical Contractors, Inc. (PAR), a wholly owned subsidiary of Quanta, to significantly increase its resources allocated
to the project in order to meet the customer-required completion date. Revenues associated with this change order of approximately $165 million were accrued and recognized as a component of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on
uncompleted contracts. Following completion of the project, PAR and San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) had ongoing meetings to review project scope, costs and performance criteria in order to reach resolution on the additional
work performed and pricing of the change order under the contract, which resulted in PAR and SDG&E being in agreement as to PAR’s direct costs incurred in completing the project. Although the parties agreed upon PAR’s direct costs, the
parties have been unsuccessful in agreeing on the final amount owed to PAR. As a result, PAR initiated arbitration proceedings in the fourth quarter of 2013 pursuant to a contractually agreed upon dispute resolution process. See

Litigation and
Claims —Sunrise Powerlink Arbitration

in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information. We have reclassified the recognized
balance related to this contract from costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts into other assets, net since this process is not expected to conclude within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2013, no
interest has been accrued related to this long-term receivable since the arbitration process is still ongoing. The aggregate contract price adjustments discussed above represent management’s best estimate of additional contract revenues which
have been earned and which management believes are probable of collection. The amounts ultimately realized by us upon final acceptance by our customers could be higher or lower than such estimated amounts. Although we believe that we are entitled to
the amount PAR is seeking in the matter related to the Sunrise Powerlink project, due to the nature of those proceedings, an adverse result in that matter could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

Fiber Optic Licensing

— The fiber optic licensing business constructs and
licenses the right to use fiber optic telecommunications facilities to its customers pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with terms from five to twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal options. Under those agreements, customers are
provided the right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic facility, with the facility owned and maintained by us. Revenues, including any initial fees or advance billings, are recognized ratably over the expected length of the agreements,
including probable renewal periods. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, initial fees and advance billings on these licensing agreements not yet recorded in revenue were $48.8 million and $46.4 million and are recognized as deferred revenue, with
$40.2 million and $37.7 million considered to be long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Actual revenues may differ from those estimates if the contracts are not renewed as expected.

Self-Insurance.

We are insured for employer’s liability, general liability, auto liability and workers’
compensation claims. On August 1, 2013, we renewed our employer’s liability, general liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation policies for the 2013 - 2014 policy year. As a result of the renewal, the deductibles for general
liability and auto liability increased from $5.0 million to $10.0 million per occurrence, while the deductible for workers’ compensation remained at $5.0 million per occurrence and the deductible for employer’s



liability remained at $1.0 million per occurrence. Additionally, in connection with this renewal, the amount of letters of credit required by us to secure our obligations under our casualty
insurance programs, which is discussed further below, has increased. We also have employee health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $375,000
per claimant per year.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimate of the ultimate
liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an
injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are
adequate. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the gross amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $161.8 million and $160.8 million, with $122.6 million and $120.2 million considered to be long-term and included in other non-current
liabilities. Related insurance recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $9.1 million and $22.2 million, of which $0.7 million and $2.3 million are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $8.4 million and
$19.9 million are included in other assets, net.

We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore
deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel our coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or we may elect not to obtain certain types or incremental levels of
insurance if we believe that the cost to obtain such coverage exceeds the additional benefits obtained. In any such event, our overall risk exposure would increase, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows.

Valuation of Goodwill.

We have recorded goodwill in connection with our historical acquisitions
of companies. Upon acquisition, these companies have been either combined into one of our existing operating units or managed on a stand-alone basis as an individual operating unit. Goodwill recorded in connection with these acquisitions is subject
to an annual assessment for impairment, which we perform at the operating unit level for each operating unit that carries a balance of goodwill. Each of our operating units is organized into one of three internal divisions: the Electric Power
Division, the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Division or the Fiber Optic Licensing Division. As most of the companies acquired by us provide multiple types of services for multiple types of customers, these divisional designations are based on the
predominant type of work performed by each operating unit at the point in time the divisional designation is made. Goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level for
which discrete financial information is available, and we have determined that our individual operating units represent our reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill impairments.

We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the

two-step

fair value-based impairment test described below. If we believe that, as a result of our qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. We can choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of our reporting units. We can also bypass the qualitative assessment for any
reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. Qualitative indicators including deterioration in macroeconomic conditions,
declining financial performance, or a sustained decrease in share price, among other things, may trigger the need for annual or interim impairment testing of goodwill associated with one or all of the reporting units.

Our goodwill impairment assessment is performed at year-end or more frequently if events or circumstances arise which indicate
that goodwill may be impaired. For instance, a decrease in our market capitalization below book value, a significant change in business climate or loss of a significant customer, as well as the qualitative



indicators referenced above, may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of goodwill for one or all of our reporting units. The first step of the two-step fair value-based test involves
comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step compares the carrying amount of
the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied fair value of its goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction to goodwill with a corresponding charge to
operating expense.

We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighted combination of the discounted cash
flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches, with heavier weighting on the discounted cash flow method, as in management’s opinion, this method currently results in the most accurate calculation of a reporting
unit’s fair value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, weighted
average costs of capital and future market conditions, among others. We believe the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information, but variations in any of the assumptions could
result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated.

Under the discounted cash flow method, we determine fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting
unit, discounted to present value using risk-adjusted industry discount rates, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. Cash flow projections are derived
from budgeted amounts and operating forecasts (typically a one-year model) plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are developed for each reporting unit using growth rates
that management believes are reasonably likely to occur, along with a terminal value derived from the reporting unit’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The EBITDA multiples for each reporting unit are
based on trailing twelve-month comparable industry data.

Under the market multiple and market capitalization approaches,
we determine the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units by applying transaction multiples to each reporting unit’s projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate with similar historical calculations using either a one, two or
three year average. For the market capitalization approach, we add a reasonable control premium, which is estimated as the premium that would be received in a sale of the reporting unit in an orderly transaction between market participants.

The projected cash flows and estimated levels of EBITDA by reporting unit were used to determine fair value under the three
approaches discussed herein. The following table presents the significant estimates used by management in determining the fair values of our reporting units at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:

For recently acquired reporting units, a step one impairment test may indicate an
implied fair value that is substantially similar to the reporting unit’s carrying value. Such similarities in value are generally an indication that management’s estimates of future cash flows associated with the recently acquired
reporting unit remain relatively consistent with the assumptions that were used to derive its initial fair value.

During
the fourth quarter of 2013, a two-step fair-value based goodwill impairment analysis was performed for each of our reporting units, and no reporting units were evaluated solely on a qualitative basis. The analysis indicated that the implied fair
value of each of our reporting units, other than recently acquired reporting units, was substantially in excess of its carrying value. Following the analysis, management concluded that no impairment was indicated at any reporting unit. As discussed
generally above, when evaluating the 2013 step one impairment test results, management considered many factors in determining whether or not an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit was reasonably likely to occur in future periods, including
future market conditions and the economic environment in which our reporting units were operating. Additionally, management considered the sensitivity of its fair value estimates to changes in certain valuation assumptions and, after giving
consideration to at least a 10% decrease in the fair value of each of our reporting units, the results of the assessment at December 31, 2013 did not change. However, circumstances such as market declines, unfavorable economic conditions, the
loss of a major customer or other factors could impact the valuation of goodwill in future periods.

The goodwill analysis
performed for each reporting unit was based on estimates and industry comparables obtained from the electric power, oil and gas and fiber optic licensing industries, and no impairment was indicated. The 15-year discounted cash flow model used for
fiber optic licensing was based on the long-term nature of the underlying fiber optic network licensing agreements.

We
assigned a higher weighting to the discounted cash flow approach in all periods to reflect increased expectations of market value being determined from a “held and used” model. Discount rates for the 2012 analysis declined from those of
the prior year for the reporting units providing predominately electric power and oil and gas infrastructure services due to generally more favorable market conditions for these reporting units in 2012 as compared to 2011. Additionally, discount
rates for the 2012 analysis declined from those of the prior year for the reporting unit providing predominately fiber optic licensing due to generally more favorable market conditions for this reporting unit in 2012 as compared to 2011.

As stated previously, cash flows are derived from budgeted amounts and operating forecasts that have been evaluated by
management. In connection with the 2013 assessment, projected annual growth rates by reporting unit varied widely with ranges from 0% to 38% for reporting units in the electric power and the oil and gas infrastructure divisions and 0% to 12% for the
reporting unit in fiber optic licensing.

Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and our projections
may vary from cash flows eventually realized. Changes in our judgments and projections could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of reporting units and intangible assets and could result in an impairment. Variances in the
assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, cost of capital, growth rates and acquisition multiples applied could have an impact on the assessment of impairments and any amount of goodwill impairment charges recorded. For example, lower
growth rates, lower acquisition multiples or higher costs of capital assumptions would all individually lead to lower fair value assessments and potentially increased frequency or size of goodwill impairments. Any goodwill or other intangible
impairment would be included in the consolidated statements of operations.

Based on the first step of the goodwill
impairment analysis, we compared the sum of fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization at December 31, 2013 and determined that the excess of the aggregate fair value of all reporting units to our market capitalization
reflected a reasonable control premium. Our market capitalization at December 31, 2013 was approximately $6.83 billion, and our total stockholders’ equity was approximately $4.23 billion. We determined that there was no goodwill impairment
at December 31, 2013.



Increases in the carrying value of individual reporting units that may be indicated by our impairment tests are not recorded, therefore we may record goodwill impairments in the future, even when
the aggregate fair value of our reporting units as a whole may increase.

We and our customers continue to operate in an
uncertain business environment, with increasing regulatory requirements and only gradual recovery in the economy from recessionary levels. We are closely monitoring our customers and the effect that changes in economic and market conditions have had
or may have on them. Certain of our customers have reduced spending in recent years, which we attribute to the negative economic and market conditions, and we anticipate that these negative conditions may continue to affect demand for some of our
services in the near-term. We continue to evaluate the impact of the economic environment on our reporting units and the valuation of recorded goodwill. Although we are not aware of circumstances that would lead to a goodwill impairment at a
reporting unit currently, circumstances such as a continued market decline, the loss of a major customer or other factors could impact the valuation of goodwill in the future.

Our goodwill is included in multiple reporting units. Due to the cyclical nature of our business, and the other factors
described under

“Risk Factors”

in Item 1A, the profitability of our individual reporting units may suffer from downturns in customer demand and other factors. These factors may have a disproportionate impact on the individual
reporting units as compared to Quanta as a whole and might adversely affect such fair value of individual reporting units. If material adverse conditions occur that impact our reporting units, our future estimates of fair value may not support the
carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units, and the related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered recoverable.

Valuation of Other Intangibles.

Our intangible assets include customer relationships, backlog, trade names,
non-compete agreements, patented rights and developed technology, all subject to amortization, along with other intangible assets not subject to amortization. The value of customer relationships is estimated as of the date a business is acquired
based on the value-in-use concept utilizing the income approach, specifically the excess earnings method. The excess earnings analysis consists of discounting to present value the projected cash flows attributable to the customer relationships, with
consideration given to customer contract renewals, the importance or lack thereof of existing customer relationships to our business plan, income taxes and required rates of return. We value backlog for acquired businesses as of the acquisition date
based upon the contractual nature of the backlog within each service line, using the income approach to discount back to present value the cash flows attributable to the backlog. The value of trade names is estimated using the relief-from-royalty
method of the income approach. This approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this intangible asset.

We amortize intangible assets based upon the estimated consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset or on a
straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For instance, a significant change in business climate or a loss of a significant customer, among other things, may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of intangible
assets. An impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets.

We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be realizable. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if an
impairment of such asset is necessary. This requires us to make long-term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and future market conditions.
Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and our projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized. Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. The
effect of any impairment would be



to expense the difference between the fair value of such asset and its carrying value. Such expense would be reflected in income (loss) from operations in the consolidated statements of
operations. In addition, we estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets and other intangibles and periodically review these estimates to determine whether these lives are appropriate.

Current and Long-term Accounts and Notes Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

We provide an allowance
for doubtful accounts when collection of an account or note receivable is considered doubtful, and receivables are written off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible. Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are
certain judgments and estimates including, among others, our customer’s access to capital, our customer’s willingness or ability to pay, general economic and market conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer. We consider
accounts receivable delinquent after 30 days but do not generally include delinquent accounts in our analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts unless the accounts receivable have been outstanding for at least 90 days. In addition to balances
that have been outstanding for 90 days or more, we also include accounts receivable balances that relate to customers in bankruptcy or with other known difficulties in our analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Material changes in our
customers’ business or cash flows, which may be impacted by negative economic and market conditions, could affect our ability to collect amounts due from them. Should customers experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy, or should
anticipated recoveries relating to receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations fail to materialize, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current allowances provided.

Income Taxes.

We follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial

reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in
effect when the underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled.

We regularly evaluate valuation
allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain. The estimation of required valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon
the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. If actual future taxable income
differs from our estimates, we may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent estimated.

We record reserves for income
taxes related to certain tax positions in those instances where we consider it more likely than not that additional taxes may be due in excess of amounts reflected on income tax returns filed. When recording reserves for expected tax consequences of
uncertain positions, we assume that taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. We continually review exposure to additional tax obligations, and as further information is known or events occur, changes in tax
reserves may be recorded. To the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have been accrued and are classified in the provision for income taxes.

The income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, we are required to make many subjective
assumptions and judgments regarding our tax positions that could materially affect amounts recognized in our future consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive income.

Outlook

We currently see growth opportunities across all the industries we serve. However, we and our customers continue to operate in
a somewhat uncertain business environment, with gradual improvement in the economy yet continuing uncertainty in the marketplace. Our customers are also facing stringent regulatory and environmental requirements as they implement projects to enhance
and expand their infrastructure. These



economic and regulatory factors have negatively affected our results in the past and may continue to create some uncertainty as to the timing of anticipated customer spending. We believe that our
financial and operational strengths will enable us to manage these challenges and uncertainties, and we remain optimistic about our

near-term

and long-term opportunities.

Electric Power Infrastructure Services Segment

The North American electric grid is aging and requires significant upgrades and maintenance to meet current and future demands
for power. Over the past several years, many utilities across North America have begun to implement plans to improve their transmission systems in order to improve reliability and reduce congestion. Among other things, these activities include new
construction, structure change-outs, line upgrades and maintenance projects on many transmission systems. In addition, state renewable portfolio standards, which set required or voluntary standards for how much power is to be generated from
renewable energy sources, can result in the need for additional transmission lines and substations to transport the power from these facilities, which are often in remote locations, to demand centers. Other factors, such as the reliability standards
issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and other regulatory actions, are also driving transmission system upgrades and expansions. We believe these factors create significant opportunities for our transmission
infrastructure services.

We believe that utilities remain committed to the expansion and strengthening of their
transmission infrastructure with planning, engineering and funding for many of their projects in place. The regulatory and environmental permitting processes remain a hurdle for some proposed transmission and renewable energy projects, and these
factors continue to create uncertainty as to timing of this spending. The timing and scope of projects can also be affected by other factors such as siting, right-of-way and unfavorable economic and market conditions. We anticipate many of these
issues to be overcome and spending on transmission projects to be active over the next few years. We currently have a number of these projects underway, and we expect this segment’s backlog to remain strong throughout 2014.

Several existing, pending or proposed legislative or regulatory actions may also positively affect demand for the services
provided by this segment in the long term, particularly in connection with electric power infrastructure and renewable energy spending. For example, legislative or regulatory action that alleviates some of the siting and right-of-way challenges that
impact transmission projects would potentially accelerate future transmission line construction. We also anticipate increased infrastructure spending by our customers as a result of legislation requiring the power industry to meet federal
reliability standards for its transmission and distribution systems and providing incentives to the industry to invest in and improve maintenance on its systems. Developments in environmental regulations concerning fossil fuel power generation
plants are expected to result in the need to retire or upgrade older coal-fired generation facilities to comply with new environmental and emission rules. Much of the electricity previously generated from retired coal-fired generation facilities is
expected to be replaced over the coming years by newly developed natural gas-fired generation facilities. We believe this “coal to gas” dynamic will require old transmission lines to be updated, rebuilt or replaced with higher voltage
transmission infrastructure as well as the construction of new transmission infrastructure to connect new natural gas-fired generation facilities to the grid. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued FERC Order No. 1000 to promote
more efficient and cost-effective development of new transmission facilities. The order establishes transmission planning and cost allocation requirements intended to facilitate multi-state electric transmission lines and to encourage competition by
removing, under certain conditions, federal rights of first refusal from FERC-approved tariffs and agreements. We believe FERC Order No. 1000, which was affirmed by FERC in May 2012 with the issuance of FERC Order No. 1000-A, will have a
favorable impact on electric transmission line development, although the impact of its implementation is not expected to occur for several years.

We benefited from increases in distribution spending throughout 2011, 2012 and 2013, despite continued economic and political
uncertainties. However, as a result of reduced spending by utilities on their distribution



systems during 2009 and 2010, combined with the need to meet reliability requirements, we believe there is an ongoing need for utilities to resume sustained investment in their distribution
systems in order to properly maintain their systems. In addition, a number of utilities are implementing system upgrades or “hardening” programs in response to severe weather events that have occurred over the past few years, which is also
increasing distribution investment in some regions of the United States. We also anticipate that utilities will continue to integrate “smart grid” technologies into their transmission and distribution systems over time to improve grid
management and create efficiencies. Development and installation of smart grid technologies and other energy efficiency initiatives have benefited from stimulus funding under the ARRA, as well as the implementation of grid management initiatives by
utilities and the desire by consumers for more efficient energy use.

The economic feasibility of renewable energy
projects, and therefore, the attractiveness of investment in the projects, may depend on the availability of tax incentive programs or the ability of the project developer to take advantage of such incentives, and there is no assurance that the
government will extend existing tax incentives or create new incentive or funding programs in the future. Although we see additional developments of renewable energy projects, primarily utility-scale solar facilities which could create increased
demand for our engineering, procurement and construction services, we believe there is some uncertainty with these projects advancing towards award and construction.

Several industry and market trends are also prompting customers in the electric power industry to seek outsourcing partners.
These trends include an aging utility workforce, increasing costs and labor availability issues. We believe the economic recession in the United States slowed employee retirements by many utility workers, causing the growth trend in outsourcing to
temporarily pause. As the economy and financial markets continue to recover, we believe utility employee retirements could return to normal levels, which should result in an increase in outsourcing opportunities. The need to ensure available labor
resources for larger projects also drives strategic relationships with customers.

Oil and Gas Infrastructure
Services Segment

We see growth opportunities in our oil and gas infrastructure operations, primarily in the
installation and maintenance of mainline pipe, gathering systems, production systems and related facilities, as well as pipeline integrity and specialty services such as horizontal directional drilling. We believe opportunities for this segment
exist as a result of the increase in the ongoing development of unconventional shale formations in North America that produce natural gas, natural gas liquids and/or crude oil, as well as the development of Canadian oil sands and the development of
coal seam gas and unconventional shale formations in Australia, which will require the construction of mainline pipe infrastructure to connect production with demand centers and the development of midstream gathering infrastructure within areas of
production. We also believe the goals of clean energy and energy independence for North America, as well as more stringent environmental regulations, will make abundant, low-cost natural gas the fuel of choice versus coal for power generation over
time, creating the need for continued investment in natural gas infrastructure. We believe our position as a leading provider of mainline pipe and gathering system infrastructure services in North America and Australia will allow us to capitalize on
these opportunities.

The oil and gas industry is cyclical and subject to volatility as a result of fluctuations in
natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil prices. In the past, sustained periods of low prices for these products have negatively impacted the development of these natural resources and related infrastructure. In addition, environmental scrutiny,
stringent regulatory requirements and cumbersome permitting processes have caused delays in some mainline pipe projects during the past several years. These dynamics resulted in below average mainline pipe construction opportunities for us and the
industry in 2011 and 2012.

The lack of mainline pipe opportunities in 2011 and 2012 negatively impacted our Oil and Gas
Infrastructure Services segment margins, in part as a result of our inability to adequately cover certain fixed costs. Margins for mainline pipe projects are also subject to significant performance risk, which can arise from



adverse weather conditions, challenging geography, customer decisions and crew productivity. Our specific opportunities in the mainline pipe business are sometimes difficult to predict because of
the seasonality of the bidding and construction cycles within the industry.

A number of large mainline pipe projects are
proposed from the Canadian oil sands and U.S. shale developments to refineries and other demand centers. Many of these projects are still developing, though several mainline projects have been awarded to us and various pipeline construction
contractors. While there is risk that some of these projects will not occur or could be delayed, we are encouraged by these proposed mainline pipe development plans and the progression of some mainline projects being awarded to contractors, which
could create an improved and favorable mainline pipe market in 2014 for us and the industry in North America. We also believe there are significant mainline pipeline opportunities in Australia driven by the production of coal seam gas for LNG
export. A number of LNG export facilities are under construction and proposed for development, and pipelines and related infrastructure will be required to serve these facilities. In addition, unconventional shale plays in Australia constitute,
according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the seventh largest potential natural gas and sixth largest potential oil resources in the world. Development of Australia’s unconventional shale plays are in the early stages and will
require construction of significant gathering, mainline and related infrastructure. We believe we will gain more visibility into these evolving dynamics during 2014.

Our customers continue to invest in infrastructure needed to support the development of unconventional shales, particularly
liquid rich formations. We continue to increase our presence in areas where unconventional shale formations are located, to continue to position us to successfully pursue projects associated with midstream gathering infrastructure development.
Demand for pipeline services to support shale gathering infrastructure continues to be active, and we believe it will remain so into the foreseeable future. We have also expanded our service offerings in this segment through several recent
acquisitions, including an acquisition in Australia, which has different market drivers and seasonality as compared to North America. In addition, recent acquisitions of companies that provide pipeline logistics services to the natural gas and oil
industry in the United States and specialty services to the offshore oil and gas industry further enhance the segment’s service offerings, customer base and end markets.

We also see growth potential in some of our other pipeline services. The U.S. Department of Transportation has implemented
significant regulatory legislation through the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration relating to pipeline integrity requirements that we expect will increase the demand for our pipeline integrity, rehabilitation and replacement
services over the long-term. As pipeline integrity testing requirements increase in stringency and frequency, we believe more information will be gathered about the condition of the nation’s pipeline infrastructure and will result in an
increase in spending by our customers on pipeline integrity initiatives. We also operate an engineering, research and development business that develops and owns pipeline inspection tools, enhancing our pipeline integrity offerings. We believe that
our ability to offer a complete pipeline integrity turnkey solution to pipeline companies and gas utilities provides us an advantageous position in providing these services to our customers. We are also experiencing an increase in demand for our
natural gas distribution services as a result of continuing improvement in economic conditions and lower natural gas prices.

We believe there are meaningful opportunities for us to penetrate the offshore and inland water energy markets in providing
various infrastructure design, installation and maintenance services primarily to the Gulf of Mexico region but also in select international markets. The offshore service opportunities we see are very similar to what we perform onshore in this
segment, and several of our existing onshore customers who also have offshore assets have expressed interest in our ability to provide offshore services. Demand for offshore energy infrastructure services is similar to that on land, including the
need for engineering, construction and maintenance services for new and existing offshore exploration and production platforms. In addition, the majority of the thousands of miles of marine based pipelines and related production facilities are
approaching or are beyond the end of their useful lives. We see this as an opportunity to leverage our onshore pipeline integrity services and



technology to the offshore market’s aging infrastructure. Further, new regulations and the more stringent enforcement of existing regulations administered by the Bureau of Safety and
Environmental Enforcement should create opportunities for offshore energy infrastructure construction, repair and replacement services.

Overall, we are optimistic about this segment’s operations going forward. We continue to believe that mainline pipe
opportunities can provide strong profitability, although these projects and the profits they generate are often subject to more cyclicality than our other service offerings. We have also taken steps to diversify our operations in this segment
through other services, such as pipeline integrity, pipeline logistics, and offshore specialty services. We believe these measures, together with the potential for mainline pipe opportunities, will position us for profitable growth in this segment
over the long-term.

Fiber Optic Licensing and Other Segment

Our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment is experiencing growth primarily through geographic expansion, with a focus on
markets where secure high-speed networks are important, such as markets where enterprises, communications carriers, educational, financial services and healthcare institutions are prevalent. We continue to see opportunities for growth both in the
markets we currently serve and new markets. The education market, which comprises a significant portion of this segment’s revenue, has been negatively impacted over the last few years by challenging economic conditions and budgetary
constraints. These constraints eased through the end of 2012, and we currently see spending patterns providing renewed opportunities for growth. However, expanding the markets we serve continues to create competitive pressure which may impact this
segment’s prospects for future growth.

We are also expanding our service offerings to provide lit services. For lit
services, we procure and own the electronic equipment necessary to make the fiber optic network operational and provide network management services to customers. The addressable market opportunity for lit services is larger than the dark fiber
services market, and we believe providing lit services should enable us to leverage the fiber optic network capacity in our existing and future fiber networks. We have been investing in the necessary people and equipment needed to expand and grow
our lit services and believe lit services will provide attractive growth opportunities.

Our Fiber Optic Licensing and
Other segment typically generates higher margins than our other operations, but we can give no assurance that the Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment margins will continue at historical levels. Additionally, we anticipate the need for continued
capital expenditures to support the build-out of our networks and growth of this business. The Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment also provides various telecommunications infrastructure services on a limited and ancillary basis, primarily to
our customers in the electric power industry. Due to the disposition of our telecommunications subsidiaries, telecommunications services are no longer a strategic priority for us. We will continue to provide these services to utility customers on an
as needed basis. However, we believe that expected increases in this segment’s revenues associated with fiber optic licensing services could be offset by decreases in other telecommunications infrastructure service revenues.

Conclusion

We continue to see growth opportunities in all of the industry segments we serve, despite continuing challenges from
restrictive regulatory requirements and uncertain economic conditions. We are benefiting from utilities’ increased spending on projects to upgrade and expand their electric power transmission infrastructure to improve system reliability and to
deliver renewable electricity from new generation sources to demand centers. Favorable industry legislation is also creating incentives and a positive environment for utilities to invest in their electrical infrastructure, in particular for
transmission infrastructure. Additional environmental regulations concerning fossil fuel power generation emissions create opportunities for transmission lines to be updated, rebuilt or replaced due to “coal to gas” facility replacements.
We also expect utilities to outsource more of their work to companies like us, due in part to their aging workforce issues. We believe that we remain the partner of choice for many utilities in need of broad infrastructure expertise, specialty
equipment and workforce resources.



We believe that we are one of the largest full-service providers of oil and gas
infrastructure services in North America, which positions us to leverage opportunities driven by the development and production of resources from North American unconventional shale developments, the Canadian oil sands and coal seam gas and
unconventional shale formations in Australia. Development activity in liquid-rich shale areas in North America is strong, increasing the need for gathering system infrastructure, and we are seeing encouraging indications that the increases in
mainline pipe project activity in 2013 could continue in 2014. We also believe that our strategy to pursue midstream gathering system opportunities in liquid-rich unconventional shales in the U.S., as well as the anticipated increase in demand for
our pipeline integrity, rehabilitation and replacement services from pipeline integrity initiatives, and other services in adjacent markets that we have gained through recent acquisitions, will create attractive growth potential for us and also
further diversify the services provided by our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment.

Our electric distribution and
gas distribution services were both significantly affected by the uncertain economic conditions that existed during the recent recession. Demand for our electric distribution services has increased over the past three years as the economy has
stabilized and spending on maintenance to improve reliability has returned. We are optimistic that continued implementation of electric distribution reliability programs and the potential for improvement in the housing market will facilitate
moderate growth in demand for our electric distribution services. Gas distribution spending has been driven primarily by improving economic conditions and the lower cost of natural gas.

Competitive pricing environments, project delays and effects from restrictive regulatory requirements have negatively impacted
our margins in the past and could affect our margins in the future. Additionally, margins may be negatively impacted on a quarterly basis due to adverse weather conditions, timing of project starts or completions and other factors as described in
“Understanding Margins” above. We continue to focus on the elements of the business we can control, including costs, the margins we accept on projects, collecting receivables, ensuring quality service, rightsizing initiatives as needed to
match the markets we serve, and safely executing on the projects we are awarded.

Capital expenditures for 2014 are
expected to be between $300 million to $325 million, of which approximately $50 million to $60 million of these expenditures are targeted for fiber optic network expansion, with the majority of the remaining expenditures for operating equipment. We
expect 2014 capital expenditures to be funded substantially through internal cash flows, cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility.

We continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions and similar investments to broaden our customer base, expand our
geographic area of operation, grow our portfolio of services and increase opportunities across our operations. We believe that additional attractive acquisition candidates exist primarily as a result of the highly fragmented nature of the industry,
the inability of many companies to expand and modernize due to capital constraints, and the desire of owners for liquidity. We also believe that our financial strength and experienced management team are attractive to acquisition candidates.

Certain international regions present significant opportunities for growth over time across many of our operations. We are
evaluating ways in which we can strategically apply our expertise to strengthen infrastructure in various foreign countries where infrastructure enhancements are increasingly important. For example, we are actively pursuing opportunities in growth
markets where we can leverage our technology or proprietary work methods, such as our energized services, to establish a presence in these markets.

We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize upon opportunities and trends in the industries we serve because of our
proven full-service operations with broad geographic reach, financial strength and technical expertise. Additionally, we believe that these industry opportunities and trends will increase the demand for our services over the long-term, although the
actual timing, magnitude and impact of these opportunities and trends on our operating results and financial position is difficult to predict.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our primary exposure to market risk relates to unfavorable changes in concentration of credit risk, interest rates and currency
exchange rates.

Credit Risk.

We are subject to concentrations of credit risk related to our cash and cash
equivalents and our accounts receivable, including amounts related to unbilled accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. Substantially all of our cash investments are managed by what we
believe to be high credit quality financial institutions. In accordance with our investment policies, these

institutions are authorized to invest this cash in a diversified portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality investments, which
primarily include interest-bearing demand deposits and money market mutual funds with original maturities of three months or less. Although we do not currently believe the principal amounts of these investments are subject to any material risk of
loss, changes in economic conditions could impact the interest income we receive from these investments. In addition, as we grant credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, we are subject to potential credit risk related to our
customers’ ability to pay for services provided. This risk may be heightened as a result of the depressed economic and financial market conditions that have existed in recent years. However, we believe the concentration of credit risk related
to trade accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts is limited because of the diversity of our customers. We perform ongoing credit risk assessments of our customers and financial institutions
and in some cases we obtain collateral or other security from our customers.

Interest Rate and Market
Risk.

Currently, we do not have any significant assets or obligations with exposure to significant interest rate and market risk. Although we had credit facility borrowings outstanding at various times in 2013 and 2012 which exposed us to
interest rate risk, there were no credit facility borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2013.

Currency
Risk.

We conduct operations primarily in the U.S., Canada and Australia. Future earnings are subject to change due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional
currencies. To minimize the need for foreign currency forward contracts to hedge this exposure, our objective is to manage foreign currency exposure by maintaining a minimal consolidated net asset or net liability position in a currency other than
the functional currency.

We may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of our foreign
currency exposures. These exposures may include revenues generated in foreign jurisdictions and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. There were no open foreign currency derivative
contracts at December 31, 2013.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

Management’s Report on Financial Information and Procedures

The accompanying financial statements of Quanta Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries were prepared by management. These
financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, applying certain estimates and judgments as required.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure
controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control
system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
assurances and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.



The effectiveness of Quanta Services, Inc.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears herein.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2013 excluded the six acquisitions we completed in 2013. Such exclusion was in accordance with SEC guidance that an assessment of recently acquired businesses may be omitted in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting,
provided the acquisition took place within twelve months of management’s evaluation. These acquisitions comprised approximately 10.1% of our consolidated assets at December 31, 2013 and 3.9% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2013.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Quanta Services, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income, cash flows and equity, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Quanta Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, management has excluded its 2013 acquisitions from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 because these acquisitions were made by the Company through purchase business combinations during
2013. We have also excluded the Company’s 2013 acquisitions from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. The 2013 acquisitions of the Company and its related subsidiaries are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company and have
total assets and revenues which represent approximately 10.1% and 3.9%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013.

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION:

Quanta Services, Inc. (Quanta) is a leading provider of specialty contracting services, offering
infrastructure solutions primarily to the electric power and oil and gas industries in North America and in select international markets. Effective December 31, 2013, Quanta’s Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment was renamed
the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment to better align with this segment’s service offerings and end-customer markets. No changes have been made to this segment’s financial results. Quanta reports its results under three
reportable segments: (1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services, (2) Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services and (3) Fiber Optic Licensing and Other.

Electric Power Infrastructure Services Segment

The Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment provides comprehensive network solutions to customers in the electric power
industry. Services performed by the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power transmission and distribution infrastructure and substation facilities
along with other engineering and technical services. This segment also provides emergency restoration services, including the repair of infrastructure damaged by inclement weather, the energized installation, maintenance and upgrade of electric
power infrastructure utilizing unique bare hand and hot stick methods and Quanta’s proprietary robotic arm technologies, and the installation of “smart grid” technologies on electric power networks. In addition, this segment designs,
installs and maintains renewable energy generation facilities, consisting of solar, wind and certain types of natural gas generation facilities, and related switchyards and transmission infrastructure to transport power to demand centers. To a
lesser extent, this segment provides services such as the design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, installation of traffic networks and the installation of cable and control systems for light rail lines.

Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Segment

The Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment provides comprehensive network solutions to customers involved in the
development and transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline products. Services performed by the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design, installation, repair and maintenance of pipeline transmission and
distribution systems, gathering systems, production systems and compressor and pump stations, as well as related trenching, directional boring and automatic welding services. In addition, this segment’s services include pipeline protection,
integrity testing, rehabilitation and replacement, fabrication of pipeline support systems and related structures and facilities, and infrastructure services for the offshore and inland water energy markets. To a lesser extent, this segment designs,
installs and maintains airport fueling systems as well as water and sewer infrastructure.

Fiber Optic Licensing and
Other Segment

The Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment designs, procures, constructs, maintains and owns fiber
optic telecommunications infrastructure in select markets and licenses the right to use these point-to-point fiber optic telecommunications facilities to its customers pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with terms from five to twenty-five
years, inclusive of certain renewal options. Under these agreements, customers are provided the right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic network, with the network owned and maintained by Quanta. Additionally, the Fiber Optic Licensing
and Other segment is expanding into lit services, with Quanta providing network management services to customers as well as owning the electronic equipment necessary to make the fiber optic network operational. This segment services customers in
multiple institutional sectors, including communications carriers as well as education, financial services, healthcare and other business enterprises with high bandwidth telecommunication needs. The telecommunication services provided through this
segment are



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission and certain state public utility commissions. The Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment also provides various telecommunication
infrastructure services on a limited basis primarily to Quanta’s customers in the electric power industry.

Acquisitions

During 2013, Quanta acquired six businesses, which included electric power infrastructure services companies and oil and gas
infrastructure services companies based in the U.S., Canada and Australia. During the first and second quarters of 2012, Quanta acquired four businesses, which included one electric power infrastructure services company based in Canada, two electric
power infrastructure services companies based in the United States and one oil and gas infrastructure services company based in the United States. During the third and fourth quarters of 2011, Quanta acquired five businesses, which included three
electric power infrastructure services companies based in Canada, one electric power infrastructure services company based in the United States and one oil and gas infrastructure services company based in Australia.

Dispositions

On December 3, 2012, Quanta sold substantially all of its domestic telecommunications infrastructure services operations
and related subsidiaries for net proceeds of approximately $265.0 million. Accordingly, Quanta has presented the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of such telecommunications subsidiaries as discontinued operations for all
applicable periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. See Note 4 for more information.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Quanta include the accounts of Quanta Services, Inc. and its wholly owned
subsidiaries, which are also referred to as its operating units. The consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of certain of Quanta’s investments in joint ventures, which are either consolidated or proportionately
consolidated, as discussed in the following summary of significant accounting policies. Investments in affiliated entities in which Quanta does not have a controlling financial interest, but over which Quanta has significant influence, usually
because Quanta holds a voting interest of 20% to 50%, are accounted for using the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to
Quanta include Quanta and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Use of Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and the
reported amount of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented. Quanta reviews all significant estimates affecting its consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior
to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on Quanta’s beliefs and assumptions derived from information available at the time such judgments and estimates are made. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are
inherent in the preparation of financial statements. Estimates are primarily used in Quanta’s assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of assets, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill, other
intangibles and long-lived asset impairments, equity and other investments, loan receivables, purchase price



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

allocations, liabilities for self-insured and other claims, multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, revenue recognition for construction contracts and fiber optic licensing,
share-based compensation, operating results of reportable segments, as well as the provision for income taxes and the calculation of uncertain tax positions.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Quanta had cash and cash equivalents of $488.8 million and $394.7 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. Cash
consisting of interest-bearing demand deposits is carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Quanta considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents, which are carried at
fair value. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, cash equivalents were $247.8 million and $92.5 million, which consisted primarily of money market mutual funds and are discussed further in

“Fair Value Measurements”

below. As of
December 31, 2013 and 2012, cash and cash equivalents held in domestic bank accounts were approximately $236.7 million and $254.1 million and cash and cash equivalents held in foreign bank accounts were approximately $252.1 million and $140.6
million.

Current and Long-Term Accounts and Notes Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Quanta provides an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account or note receivable is considered doubtful, and
receivables are written off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible. Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including, among others, the customer’s access to capital, the
customer’s willingness or ability to pay, general economic and market conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer. Quanta considers accounts receivable delinquent after 30 days but does not generally include delinquent
accounts in its analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts unless the accounts receivable have been outstanding for at least 90 days. In addition to balances that have been outstanding for 90 days or more, Quanta also includes accounts
receivable balances that relate to customers in bankruptcy or with other known difficulties in its analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Material changes in Quanta’s customers’ business or cash flows, which may be impacted by
negative economic and market conditions, could affect Quanta’s ability to collect amounts due from them. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, Quanta had total allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $5.2 million and $5.4 million,
all of which were included as a reduction of net current accounts receivable. Should customers experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy, or should anticipated recoveries relating to receivables in existing bankruptcies or other
workout situations fail to materialize, Quanta could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current allowances provided.

The balances billed but not paid by customers pursuant to retainage provisions in certain contracts are generally due upon
completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer. Based on Quanta’s experience with similar contracts in recent years, the majority of the retainage balances at each balance sheet date are expected to be collected within the next
twelve months. Current retainage balances as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were approximately $194.5 million and $180.6 million and are included in accounts receivable. Retainage balances with settlement dates beyond the next twelve months are
included in other assets, net, and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $50.8 million and $22.5 million.

Within
accounts receivable, Quanta recognizes unbilled receivables in circumstances such as when revenues have been earned and recorded but the amount cannot be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date; costs have been incurred but are yet
to be billed under cost-reimbursement type contracts; or amounts arise from routine lags in billing (for example, work completed one month but not billed until the next month). These balances do not include revenues accrued for work performed under
fixed-price contracts as these amounts are recorded as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the balances of unbilled receivables included in accounts receivable were
approximately $179.2 million and $127.5 million.



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inventories

Inventories consist primarily of parts and supplies held for use in the ordinary course of business, which are valued by Quanta
at the lower of cost or market as determined by using either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or the average costing method. Inventories also include certain job specific materials not yet installed which are valued using the specific
identification method.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is computed using the straight-line method, net of estimated
salvage values, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. Depreciation expense related to property and
equipment was approximately $134.1 million, $120.3 million and $109.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Quanta capitalizes costs associated with internally developed or constructed assets primarily associated with fiber optic
licensing networks. Capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining internal-use assets, as well as payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly associated with and
devote time to placing the assets into service. Capitalization of such costs is recorded to construction work-in-process beginning when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases no later than the point at which the project is
substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose, at which point in time the asset is placed into service. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, approximately $32.4 million and $19.0 million related to fiber optic licensing networks were
recorded in construction work-in-process. These capitalized costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the economic useful life of the asset, beginning when the asset is ready for its intended use. Capitalized costs are included in property
and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets. Accrued capital expenditures were $0.6 million and $7.2 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the impact of these items has been excluded from Quanta’s capital expenditures on its
consolidated statements of cash flows due to their non-cash nature.

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged
to expense when incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated over the adjusted remaining useful life of the assets. Upon retirement or disposition of
property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be realizable. Although no such events occurred during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, if an evaluation is required, management would assess whether the carrying value of the asset group is recoverable by
comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If the asset is not recoverable, management compares the estimated fair value of the asset to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if an impairment
of such asset is necessary. The effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair value of such asset and its carrying value in the period incurred.

Other Assets, Net

Other assets, net consists primarily of long term receivables, debt issuance costs, non-current inventory, equity investments
and other investments, refundable security deposits for leased properties and insurance claims in excess of deductibles that are due from Quanta’s insurers. Included in the long-term receivables balance at December 31, 2013 is $165 million
related to the Sunrise Powerlink project that was reclassified to a long-term receivable in the



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

third quarter of 2013 due to the expected timetable for resolution of the related arbitration. As of December 31, 2013, no interest has been accrued related to this long-term receivable
since the arbitration process is still ongoing. For additional information, see

Litigation and Claims — Sunrise Powerlink Arbitration

in Note 15.

Debt Issuance Costs

Capitalized debt issuance costs related to Quanta’s credit facility and any other debt outstanding at a given balance
sheet date are included in other assets, net and are amortized into interest expense on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective agreements giving rise to the debt issuance costs, which Quanta believes approximates the effective
interest rate method. During 2013 and 2011, Quanta incurred $3.2 million and $4.1 million of debt issuance costs related to the amendment and restatement of its credit facility and recorded $0.2 million and $0.3 million of charges to interest
expense for the write-off of a portion of the debt issuance costs related to the prior facilities. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, capitalized debt issuance costs were $7.6 million and $4.4 million, with accumulated amortization of $2.4
million and $1.3 million. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, amortization expense related to capitalized debt issuance costs was $1.1 million, $0.9 million and $0.9 million, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Quanta has recorded goodwill in connection with its historical acquisitions of companies. Upon acquisition, these companies
have been either combined into one of Quanta’s existing operating units or managed on a stand-alone basis as an individual operating unit. Goodwill recorded in connection with these acquisitions is subject to an annual assessment for
impairment, which Quanta performs at the operating unit level for each operating unit that carries a balance of goodwill. Each of Quanta’s operating units is organized into one of three internal divisions: the Electric Power Division, the Oil
and Gas Infrastructure Division or the Fiber Optic Licensing Division. As most of the companies acquired by Quanta provide multiple types of services for multiple types of customers, these divisional designations are based on the predominant type of
work performed by each operating unit at the point in time the divisional designation is made. Goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level for which discrete
financial information is available, and Quanta has determined that its individual operating units represent its reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill impairments.

Quanta has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step fair
value-based impairment test described below. If Quanta believes that, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is
required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. Quanta can choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units. Quanta can also bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and
proceed directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. Qualitative indicators including deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, declining financial performance, or a
sustained decrease in share price, among other things, may trigger the need for annual or interim impairment testing of goodwill associated with one or all of the reporting units.

Quanta’s goodwill impairment assessment is performed at year-end, or more frequently if events or circumstances arise
which indicate that goodwill may be impaired. For instance, a decrease in Quanta’s market capitalization below book value, a significant change in business climate or loss of a significant customer, as well as the qualitative indicators
referenced above, may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of goodwill for one or all of its reporting units. The first step of the two-step fair value-based test involves comparing the fair value of each of Quanta’s reporting units
with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied fair value of its goodwill.
If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction to goodwill with a corresponding charge to operating expense.

Quanta determines the fair value of its reporting units using a weighted combination of the discounted cash flow, market
multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches, with heavier weighting on the discounted cash flow method, as in management’s opinion, this method currently results in the most accurate calculation of a reporting unit’s fair
value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average costs of
capital and future market conditions, among others. Quanta believes the estimates and assumptions used in its impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information, but variations in any of the assumptions could result in
materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated.

Under
the discounted cash flow method, Quanta determines fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted to present value using risk-adjusted industry discount rates, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk
of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. Cash flow projections are derived from budgeted amounts and operating forecasts (typically a one-year model) plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of
which are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are developed for each reporting unit using growth rates that management believes are reasonably likely to occur, along with a terminal value derived from the reporting unit’s
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The EBITDA multiples for each reporting unit are based on trailing twelve-month comparable industry data.

Under the market multiple and market capitalization approaches, Quanta determines the estimated fair value of each of its
reporting units by applying transaction multiples to each reporting unit’s projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate with similar historical calculations using either a one, two or three year average. For the market capitalization
approach, Quanta adds a reasonable control premium, which is estimated as the premium that would be received in a sale of the reporting unit in an orderly transaction between market participants.

The projected cash flows and estimated levels of EBITDA by reporting unit were used to determine fair value under the three
approaches discussed herein. The following table presents the significant estimates used by management in determining the fair values of Quanta’s reporting units at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For recently acquired reporting units, a step one impairment test may
indicate an implied fair value that is substantially similar to the reporting unit’s carrying value. Such similarities in value are generally an indication that management’s estimates of future cash flows associated with the recently
acquired reporting unit remain relatively consistent with the assumptions that were used to derive its initial fair value.

During the fourth quarter of 2013, a two-step fair-value based goodwill impairment analysis was performed for each of
Quanta’s reporting units, and no reporting units were evaluated solely on a qualitative basis. The analysis indicated that the implied fair value of each of Quanta’s reporting units, other than recently acquired reporting units, was
substantially in excess of its carrying value. Following the analysis, management concluded that no impairment was indicated at any reporting unit. As discussed generally above, when evaluating the 2013 step one impairment test results, management
considered many factors in determining whether or not an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit was reasonably likely to occur in future periods, including future market conditions and the economic environment in which Quanta’s reporting
units were operating. Additionally, management considered the sensitivity of its fair value estimates to changes in certain valuation assumptions and, after giving consideration to at least a 10% decrease in the fair value of each of Quanta’s
reporting units, the results of the assessment at December 31, 2013 did not change. However, circumstances such as market declines, unfavorable economic conditions, the loss of a major customer or other factors could impact the valuation of
goodwill in future periods.

The goodwill analysis performed for each reporting unit was based on estimates and industry
comparables obtained from the electric power, oil and gas and fiber optic licensing industries, and no impairment was indicated. The 15-year discounted cash flow model used for fiber optic licensing is based on the long-term nature of the underlying
fiber optic network licensing agreements.

Quanta assigned a higher weighting to the discounted cash flow approach in all
periods to reflect increased expectations of market value being determined from a “held and used” model. Discount rates for the 2012 analysis declined from those of the prior year for the reporting units providing predominately electric
power and oil and gas infrastructure services due to generally more favorable market conditions for these reporting units in 2012 as compared to 2011. Additionally, discount rates for the 2012 analysis declined from those of the prior year for the
reporting unit providing predominately fiber optic licensing due to generally more favorable market conditions for this reporting unit in 2012 as compared to 2011.

As stated previously, cash flows are derived from budgeted amounts and operating forecasts that have been evaluated by
management. In connection with the 2013 assessment, projected annual growth rates by reporting unit varied widely with ranges from 0% to 38% for reporting units in the electric power and the oil and gas divisions and 0% to 12% for the reporting unit
in fiber optic licensing.

Quanta’s intangible assets include customer relationships, backlog, trade names,
non-compete agreements, patented rights and developed technology, all subject to amortization, along with other intangible assets not subject to amortization. The value of customer relationships is estimated as of the date a business is acquired
based on the value-in-use concept utilizing the income approach, specifically the excess earnings method. The excess earnings analysis consists of discounting to present value the projected cash flows attributable to the customer relationships, with
consideration given to customer contract renewals, the importance or lack thereof of existing customer relationships to Quanta’s business plan, income taxes and required rates of return. Quanta values backlog for acquired businesses as of the
acquisition date based upon the contractual nature of the backlog within each service line, using the income approach to discount back to present value the cash flows attributable to the backlog. The value of trade names is estimated using the
relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. This approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this intangible asset.



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Quanta amortizes intangible assets based upon the estimated consumption of
the economic benefits of each intangible asset, or on a straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment and are tested
for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For instance, a significant change in business climate or a loss of a significant customer, among other things, may trigger the
need for interim impairment testing of intangible assets. An impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

Investments in Affiliates and Other Entities

In the normal course of business, Quanta enters into various types of investment arrangements, each having unique terms and
conditions. These investments may include equity interests held by Quanta in business entities, including general or limited partnerships, contractual joint ventures, or other forms of equity participation. These investments may also include
Quanta’s participation in different finance structures such as the extension of loans to project specific entities, the acquisition of convertible notes issued by project specific entities, or other strategic financing arrangements. Quanta
determines whether such investments involve a variable interest entity (VIE) based on the characteristics of the subject entity. If the entity is determined to be a VIE, then management determines if Quanta is the primary beneficiary of the entity
and whether or not consolidation of the VIE is required. The primary beneficiary consolidating the VIE must normally have both (i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance
and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE, in either case that could potentially be significant to the VIE. When Quanta is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, the VIE is consolidated and
the other party’s equity interest in the VIE is accounted for as a noncontrolling interest. In cases where Quanta determines that it has an undivided interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and profits of an unincorporated VIE (e.g., a
general partnership interest), such amounts are consolidated on a basis proportional to Quanta’s ownership interest in the unincorporated entity.

Investments in entities of which Quanta is not the primary beneficiary, but over which Quanta has the ability to exercise
significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Quanta’s share of net income or losses from unconsolidated equity investments is included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated
statements of operations when applicable. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment by assessing whether any decline in the fair value of the investment below the carrying value is other than temporary. In making this determination, factors
such as the ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment and the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity are evaluated in determining whether a loss in value should be recognized. Any impairment losses would be
recognized in other expense. Equity method investments are carried at original cost and are included in other assets, net in the consolidated balance sheet and are adjusted for Quanta’s proportionate share of the investees’ income, losses
and distributions.

On December 6, 2013, Quanta sold all of its equity ownership interest in Howard Midstream Energy
Partners, LLC (HEP) for proceeds of approximately $220.9 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $112.7 million. HEP is engaged in the business of owning, operating and constructing midstream plant and pipeline assets in the oil
and gas industry. Quanta held an equity ownership interest of approximately 31% in HEP. Quanta accounted for this investment using the equity method of accounting, and the carrying value of Quanta’s investment in HEP was approximately $90.5
million at December 31, 2012.

Revenue Recognition

Infrastructure Services

— Through its Electric Power Infrastructure Services and Oil and Gas Infrastructure
Services segments, Quanta designs, installs and maintains networks for customers in the electric power and oil and gas industries. These services may be provided pursuant to master service agreements, repair and



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

maintenance contracts and fixed price and non-fixed price installation contracts. Pricing under these contracts may be competitive unit price, cost-plus/hourly (or time and materials basis) or
fixed price (or lump sum basis), and the final terms and prices of these contracts are frequently negotiated with the customer. Under unit-based contracts, the utilization of an output-based measurement is appropriate for revenue recognition. Under
these contracts, Quanta recognizes revenue as units are completed based on pricing established between Quanta and the customer for each unit of delivery, which best reflects the pattern in which the obligation to the customer is fulfilled. Under
cost-plus/hourly and time and materials type contracts, Quanta recognizes revenue on an input basis, as labor hours are incurred and services are performed.

Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of
costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract. These contracts provide for a fixed amount of revenues for the entire project. Such contracts provide that the customer accept completion of progress to date and compensate Quanta
for services rendered, which may be measured in terms of units installed, hours expended or some other measure of progress. Contract costs include all direct materials, labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract
performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Much of the material associated with Quanta’s work is owner-furnished and is therefore not included in contract revenues and costs. The cost estimation
process is based on professional knowledge and experience of Quanta’s engineers, project managers and financial professionals. Changes in job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence
management’s assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts and therefore Quanta’s profit recognition. Changes in these factors may result in revisions to costs and income, and their effects
are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. These factors are routinely evaluated on a project by project basis throughout the project term, and the impact of corresponding revisions in management’s estimates of contract
value, contract cost and contract profit are recorded as necessary in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable and the
amount can be reasonably estimated. Quanta’s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2013 were impacted by less than 5% as a result of changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress at December 31,
2012.

The current asset “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts”
represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed for fixed price contracts. The current liability “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized
for fixed price contracts.

Quanta may incur costs subject to change orders, whether approved or unapproved by the
customer, and/or claims related to certain contracts. Quanta determines the probability that such costs will be recovered based upon evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific discussions or preliminary negotiations with the
customer or verbal approvals. Quanta treats items as a cost of contract performance in the period incurred if it is not probable that the costs will be recovered or will recognize revenue if it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted
and can be reliably estimated. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, Quanta had approximately $241.8 million and $205.0 million of change orders and/or claims that had been included as contract price adjustments on certain contracts which were in
the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business. The December 31, 2013 and 2012 balances of recognized change orders and claims included a change order from the Sunrise Powerlink project, an electric power infrastructure
services project, primarily as a result of multiple customer-directed changes to the construction schedule which required PAR Electrical Contractors, Inc. (PAR), a wholly owned subsidiary of Quanta, to significantly increase its resources to the
project in order to meet the customer-required completion date. Revenues associated with this change order of approximately $165 million were accrued and recognized as a component of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

uncompleted contracts. Following completion of the project, PAR and San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) had ongoing meetings to review project scope, costs and performance
criteria in order to reach resolution on the additional work performed and pricing of the change order under the contract, which resulted in PAR and SDG&E being in agreement as to PAR’s direct costs incurred in completing the project.
Although the parties agreed upon PAR’s direct costs, the parties have been unsuccessful in agreeing on the final amount owed to PAR. As a result, PAR initiated arbitration proceedings in the fourth quarter of 2013 pursuant to a contractually
agreed upon dispute resolution process. See

Litigation and Claims — Sunrise Powerlink Arbitration

in Note 15 for additional information. Quanta has reclassified the recognized balance related to this contract from costs and estimated
earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts into other assets, net as this process is not expected to conclude within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2013, no interest has been accrued related to this long-term receivable
since the arbitration process is still ongoing. The aggregate contract price adjustments discussed above represent management’s best estimate of additional contract revenues which have been earned and which management believes are probable of
collection. The amounts ultimately realized by Quanta upon final acceptance by its customers could be higher or lower than such estimated amounts. Although Quanta believes that it is entitled to the amount PAR is seeking in the matter related to the
Sunrise Powerlink project, due to the nature of those proceedings, an adverse result in that matter could have a material adverse effect on Quanta’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Fiber Optic Licensing

— The fiber optic licensing business constructs and licenses the right to use fiber
optic telecommunications facilities to its customers pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with terms from five to twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal options. Under those agreements, customers are provided the right to use a
portion of the capacity of a fiber optic facility, with the facility owned and maintained by Quanta. Revenues, including any initial fees or advance billings, are recognized ratably over the expected length of the agreements, including probable
renewal periods. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, initial fees and advance billings on these licensing agreements not yet recorded in revenue were $48.8 million and $46.4 million and were recognized as deferred revenue, with $40.2 million and
$37.7 million considered to be long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Minimum future licensing revenues expected to be recognized by Quanta pursuant to these agreements at December 31, 2013 were as follows (in thousands):

Income Taxes

Quanta follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recorded for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the underlying assets
or liabilities are recovered or settled.



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Quanta regularly evaluates valuation allowances established for deferred tax
assets for which future realization is uncertain. The estimation of required valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income
during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Quanta considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. If actual future taxable income differs from these estimates, Quanta
may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent estimated.

Quanta records reserves for income taxes related to certain
tax positions in those instances where Quanta considers it more likely than not that additional taxes may be due in excess of amounts reflected on income tax returns filed. When recording reserves for expected tax consequences of uncertain
positions, Quanta assumes that taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Quanta continually reviews exposure to additional tax obligations, and as further information is known or events occur, changes in tax
reserves may be recorded. To the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have been accrued and are classified in the provision for income taxes.

As of December 31, 2013, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions was $48.8
million, a decrease from December 31, 2012 of $2.4 million. This decrease in unrecognized tax benefits results from an $11.5 million decrease primarily due to the expiration of certain statute of limitations periods in the 2009 tax year,
partially offset by a $9.1 million increase due to the tax positions expected to be taken for 2013. Certain subsidiaries are under examination by various state and Canadian tax authorities for multiple periods. Quanta believes that it is reasonably
possible that within the next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits may decrease up to $6.7 million as a result of settlements of these audits or as a result of the expiration of certain statute of limitations periods.

The income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, Quanta is required to make many
subjective assumptions and judgments regarding its tax positions that could materially affect amounts recognized in its future consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations and comprehensive income.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and
diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period adjusted for all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, except in cases where the effect of the common stock equivalents
would be antidilutive.

Collective Bargaining Agreements

Some of Quanta’s operating units are parties to various collective bargaining agreements with unions that represent
certain of their employees. The collective bargaining agreements expire at various times and have typically been renegotiated and renewed on terms similar to those in the expiring agreements. The agreements require the operating units to pay
specified wages, provide certain benefits to their union employees and contribute certain amounts to multi-employer pension plans and employee benefit trusts. Quanta’s multi-employer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in
the collective bargaining agreements (usually on an annual basis), and contributions are made to the plans on a “pay-as-you-go” basis based on its union employee payrolls, which cannot be determined for future periods because the location
and number of union employees that Quanta employs at any given time and the plans in which they may participate vary depending on the projects Quanta has ongoing at any time and the need for union resources in connection with those projects.



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Stock-Based Compensation

Quanta recognizes compensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units (RSUs) to be settled in common stock
based on the fair value of the awards granted, net of estimated forfeitures, at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted stock awards and RSUs to be settled in common stock is determined based on the number of shares or RSUs granted and the
closing price of Quanta’s common stock on the date of grant. An estimate of future forfeitures is required in determining the period expense. Quanta uses historical data to estimate the forfeiture rate; however, these estimates are subject to
change and may impact the value that will ultimately be realized as compensation expense. The resulting compensation expense from discretionary awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the
vesting period, while compensation expense from performance-based awards is recognized using the graded vesting method over the requisite service period. Restricted stock awards and RSUs to be settled in common stock are subject to forfeiture,
restrictions on transfer and certain other conditions until vesting. During the restriction period, holders of restricted stock are entitled to vote and receive dividends on such shares. The cash flows resulting from the tax deductions in excess of
the compensation expense recognized for restricted stock, RSUs to be settled in common stock and stock options (excess tax benefit) are classified as financing cash flows.

Compensation expense associated with liability based awards, such as RSUs that are expected to be settled in cash, is
recognized based on a remeasurement of the fair value of the award at the end of each reporting period. RSUs to be settled in cash are intended to provide the holders with cash performance incentives that are substantially equivalent to the risks
and rewards of equity ownership in Quanta. RSUs to be settled in cash vest over a designated period, typically three years, and are subject to forfeiture under certain conditions, primarily termination of service. Upon vesting of RSUs to be settled
in cash, the holders receive for each vested RSU an amount in cash equal to the fair market value on the vesting date of one share of Quanta common stock, as specified in the applicable award agreement.

Functional Currency and Translation of Financial Statements

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the majority of Quanta’s operations, which are primarily located within the
United States. The functional currency for Quanta’s foreign operations, which are primarily located in Canada and Australia, is typically the currency of the country in which the foreign operating unit is located. Generally, the currency in
which the operating unit transacts a majority of its activities, including billings, financing, payroll and other expenditures, would be considered the functional currency. Under the relevant accounting guidance, the treatment of foreign currency
translation gains or losses is dependent upon management’s determination of the functional currency of each operating unit, which involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the operating unit. In preparing
the consolidated financial statements, Quanta translates the financial statements of its foreign operating units from their functional currency into U.S. dollars. Statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows are translated at
average monthly rates, while balance sheets are translated at the month-end exchange rates. The translation of the balance sheets at the month-end exchange rates results in translation gains or losses. If transactions are denominated in the
operating units’ functional currency, the translation gains and losses are included as a separate component of equity under the caption “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” If transactions are not denominated in the
operating units’ functional currency, the translation gains and losses are included within the statement of operations.

Derivatives

From time to time, Quanta enters into forward currency contracts that qualify as derivatives in order to hedge the risks
associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to certain forecasted



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

foreign currency denominated transactions. Quanta does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes; however, for accounting purposes, certain transactions may not meet the
criteria for cash flow hedge accounting. For a hedge to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, a hedge must be documented at the inception of the contract, with the objective and strategy stated, along with an explicit description of the
methodology used to assess hedge effectiveness. The dates (or periods) for the expected forecasted events and the nature of the exposure involved (including quantitative measures of the size of the exposure) must also be documented. At the inception
of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the hedge must be deemed to be “highly effective” at minimizing the risk of the identified exposure. Effectiveness measures relate the gains or losses of the derivative to changes in the cash flows
associated with the hedged item, and the forecasted transaction must be probable of occurring.

For forward contracts that
qualify as cash flow hedges, Quanta accounts for the change in fair value of the forward contracts directly in equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Any ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in
the period in which ineffectiveness occurs. For instance, if a forward contract is discontinued as a cash flow hedge because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period,
the related amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be reclassified to other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations in the period such determination is made. When a forecasted transaction occurs, the
portion of the accumulated gain or loss applicable to the forecasted transaction is reclassified from equity to earnings. Changes in fair value related to transactions that do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting are recorded in the
consolidated results of operations and are included in other income (expense).

Comprehensive Income

Components of comprehensive income include all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from changes in
Quanta’s capital related accounts. Quanta records other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, for foreign currency translation adjustments related to its foreign operations and for other revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are included
in comprehensive income but excluded from net income.

Litigation Costs and Reserves

Quanta records reserves when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably
estimated. Costs incurred for litigation are expensed as incurred. Further details are presented in Note 15.

Fair Value Measurements

The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due
to the short-term nature of these instruments. For disclosure purposes, qualifying assets and liabilities are categorized into three broad levels based on the priority of the inputs used to determine their fair values. The fair value hierarchy gives
the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). All of Quanta’s cash equivalents were categorized as Level 1 assets at
December 31, 2013 and 2012, as all values were based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market that Quanta has the ability to access.

In connection with Quanta’s acquisitions, identifiable intangible assets acquired include goodwill, backlog, customer
relationships, trade names, covenants not-to-compete, patented rights and developed technology. Quanta utilizes the fair value premise as the primary basis for its valuation procedures, which is a market-based approach to determine the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

transaction between market participants. Quanta periodically engages the services of an independent valuation firm when a new business is acquired to assist management with this valuation
process, including assistance with the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the development of market-based valuation assumptions. Based on these considerations, management utilizes various valuation methods, including an income
approach, a market approach and a cost approach, to determine the fair value of intangible assets acquired based on the appropriateness of each method in relation to the type of asset being valued. The assumptions used in these valuation methods are
analyzed and compared, where possible, to available market data, such as industry-based weighted average costs of capital and discount rates, trade name royalty rates, public company valuation multiples and recent market acquisition multiples. The
level of inputs used for these fair value measurements is the lowest level (Level 3). Quanta believes that these valuation methods appropriately represent the methods that would be used by other market participants in determining fair value.

Quanta uses fair value measurements on a routine basis in its assessment of assets classified as goodwill, other intangible
assets and long-lived assets held and used. In accordance with its annual impairment test during the quarter ended December 31, 2013, the carrying amounts of such assets, including goodwill, were compared to their fair values. The inputs used
for fair value measurements for goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets held and used are the lowest level (Level 3) inputs, and Quanta uses the assistance of third party specialists to develop valuation assumptions.

Quanta also uses fair value measurements in connection with the valuation of its investments in private company equity
interests and financing instruments. These valuations require significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such assets. Typically, the initial costs of these
investments are considered to represent fair market value, as such amounts are negotiated between willing market participants. On a quarterly basis, Quanta performs an evaluation of its investments to determine if an other-than-temporary decline in
the value of each investment has occurred and whether the recorded amount of each investment will be realizable. If an other-than-temporary decline in the value of an investment occurs, a fair value analysis would be performed to determine the
degree to which the investment was impaired and a corresponding charge to earnings would be recorded during the period. These types of fair market value assessments are similar to other nonrecurring fair value measures used by Quanta, which include
the use of significant judgment and available relevant market data. Such market data may include observations of the valuation of comparable companies, risk adjusted discount rates and an evaluation of the expected performance of the underlying
portfolio asset, including historical and projected levels of profitability or cash flows. In addition, a variety of additional factors will be reviewed by management, including, but not limited to, contemporaneous financing and sales transactions
with third parties, changes in market outlook and the third-party financing environment.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

On January 1, 2013, Quanta adopted an update that gives entities an option to first assess qualitative factors to
determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that its indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If, based on its qualitative assessment, an entity concludes that it is more likely than
not that the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying amount, quantitative impairment testing is required. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, quantitative impairment testing is not required. The
adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on Quanta’s consolidated financial statements.



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In July 2013, the FASB issued an update that provides guidance on the balance sheet presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit
when a net operating loss carryforward, similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforward exists as of the reporting date. The update is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15,
2013. Retrospective application is permitted. Quanta is currently evaluating the potential impact of this authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements and is planning to adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2014.

4.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS:

On December 3, 2012, Quanta sold substantially all of its domestic telecommunications infrastructure
services operations and related subsidiaries for net proceeds of approximately $265.0 million. Quanta recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $18.0 million and a corresponding tax expense of approximately $32.2 million, which resulted in a loss
on the sale, net of tax, of $14.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Quanta has presented the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of such telecommunications subsidiaries as discontinued operations for all applicable periods
presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The results of operations of these telecommunications subsidiaries were previously included primarily in the Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segment.

In connection with the sale of the telecommunications operations, Quanta will remain liable
for all income related taxes and insured claims against the subsidiaries outstanding or arising as of December 3, 2012. Additionally, Quanta accelerated the vesting of unvested shares of restricted stock held by certain employees of the
disposed telecommunications subsidiaries on December 3, 2012, the closing date of the sale. Accordingly, Quanta recorded incremental expense related to this accelerated vesting of $3.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2012. This incremental
expense is included in income from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012.

ACQUISITIONS:

2013 Acquisitions

During 2013, Quanta acquired six businesses, which included electric power infrastructure services companies and oil and gas
infrastructure services companies based in the U.S., Canada and Australia. The aggregate consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $341.1 million in cash and 3,547,482 shares of Quanta common stock valued, as of the
respective dates of issuance, at approximately $88.9 million. The results for each company have been included in Quanta’s consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective dates of acquisition. These acquisitions have enabled Quanta
to further enhance its electric power infrastructure service and oil and gas infrastructure service offerings in the United States and select international markets.



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2012 Acquisitions

In the first and second quarters of 2012, Quanta acquired four businesses, which included one electric power infrastructure
services company based in Canada, two electric power infrastructure services companies based in the United States and one oil and gas infrastructure services company based in the United States. These businesses have been reflected in Quanta’s
consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $57.5 million in cash, 1,927,113 shares of Quanta common stock valued at approximately
$37.3 million, as of the respective dates of acquisition, and the repayment of $11.0 million in debt. These acquisitions have enabled Quanta to expand its capabilities and scope of services internationally and in the United States. The financial
results of these businesses are generally included in the corresponding segment.

2011 Acquisitions

In the third and fourth quarters of 2011, Quanta acquired five businesses, which included three electric power infrastructure
services companies based in Canada, one electric power infrastructure services company based in the United States and one oil and gas infrastructure services company based in Australia. These businesses have been reflected in Quanta’s
consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $80.8 million in cash, 1,939,813 shares of Quanta common stock valued at approximately
$32.4 million, as of the respective dates of acquisition, and the repayment of $3.4 million in debt. These acquisitions have enabled Quanta to further expand its capabilities and scope of services internationally and in the United States. The
financial results of these businesses are generally included in the corresponding segment.

The following table summarizes
the aggregate consideration paid for the 2013 and 2012 acquisitions and presents the allocation of these amounts to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the respective acquisition dates. This
allocation requires the significant use of estimates and is based on information that was available to management at the time these consolidated financial statements were prepared (in thousands).

The fair value of current assets acquired in 2013 included accounts
receivable with a fair value of $83.9 million. The fair value of current assets acquired in 2012 included accounts receivable with a fair value of $15.3 million.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the net amount of the fair values assigned to assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. The 2013, 2012 and 2011 acquisitions strategically expanded Quanta’s Canadian service offering, added Australian service offerings and enhanced its domestic electric power and oil and gas infrastructure service offerings,
which Quanta believes contributes to the recognition of the goodwill. In connection with the 2013 acquisitions, goodwill of $112.5 million was recorded for reporting units included within Quanta’s electric power division and $143.3 million was
recorded for reporting units included within Quanta’s oil and gas infrastructure division at December 31, 2013. In connection with the 2012 acquisitions, goodwill of $57.5 million was recorded for reporting units included within
Quanta’s electric power division and $7.3 million was recorded for reporting units included within Quanta’s oil and gas infrastructure division at December 31, 2012. Goodwill of approximately $213.6 million and $52.9 million is
expected to be deductible for income tax purposes related to the businesses acquired in 2013 and 2012.

The pro forma combined results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and
2012 have been prepared by adjusting the historical results of Quanta to include the historical results of the 2013 acquisitions as if they occurred January 1, 2012. The pro forma combined results of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2012 have also been prepared by adjusting the historical results of Quanta to include the historical results of the 2012 acquisitions as if they occurred January 1, 2011. The pro forma combined results of operations for the
year ended December 31, 2011 have been prepared by adjusting the historical results of Quanta to include the historical results of the 2012 acquisitions as if they occurred January 1, 2011 and the historical results of the 2011
acquisitions as if it occurred January 1, 2010. These pro forma combined historical results were then adjusted for the following: a reduction of interest expense and interest income as a result of the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, a
reduction of interest income as a result of the cash consideration paid net of cash received, an increase in amortization expense due to the incremental intangible assets recorded related to the 2013, 2012 and 2011 acquisitions, an increase or
decrease in depreciation expense within cost of services related to the net impact of adjusting acquired property and equipment to the acquisition date fair value and conforming depreciable lives with Quanta’s accounting policies, an increase
in the number of outstanding shares of Quanta common stock and certain reclassifications to conform the acquired companies’ presentation to Quanta’s accounting policies. The pro forma results of operations do not include any adjustments to
eliminate the impact

of acquisition related costs or any cost savings or other synergies that may result from the 2013, 2012 and 2011 acquisitions. As noted above, the pro forma results of operations do not purport
to be indicative of the actual results that would have been achieved by the combined company for the periods presented or that may be achieved by the combined company in the future.

Revenues of approximately $251.3 million and income from continuing operations before income taxes of approximately $18.2
million are included in Quanta’s consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to the six 2013 acquisitions following their respective dates of acquisition. Additionally, revenues of approximately $125.7
million and income from continuing operations before income taxes of approximately $6.2 million are included in Quanta’s consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 related to the four 2012 acquisitions
following their respective dates of acquisition. Additionally, revenues of approximately $43.8 million and income from continuing operations before income taxes of approximately $4.4 million are included in Quanta’s consolidated results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 related to the five 2011 acquisitions following their respective dates of acquisition.

As described in Note 2, Quanta’s operating units are organized into one of
Quanta’s three internal divisions and, accordingly, Quanta’s goodwill associated with each of its operating units has been aggregated on a divisional basis and reported in the table above. These divisions are closely aligned with
Quanta’s reportable segments based on the predominant type of work performed by the operating units within the divisions. From time to time, operating units may be reorganized among Quanta’s internal divisions, as Quanta periodically

re-evaluates

strategies to better align its operations as business environments evolve. The table above presents these changes as reclassifications during the period in which the reorganization occurred. During
2012, two separate and unrelated operating units in the fiber optic licensing division were recategorized in order to improve the productivity of certain operations and more effectively accomplish management’s overall strategic plan. One
operating unit was reorganized into the electric power division and the other operating unit was reorganized into the oil and gas infrastructure division. Based on Quanta’s strategic plan, management determined that that these operating
units’ performance could be improved and their operations could potentially be increased by assigning their business lines into comparable or synergistic operations. The reorganization also resulted in reductions in redundant administrative
costs, reassignments of strategic customer relationships and progress toward management’s business development strategies.

PER SHARE INFORMATION:

Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period, and diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period adjusted for all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, except in cases where the effect of the common
stock equivalents would be antidilutive. The amounts used to compute the basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 are illustrated below (in thousands):

For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, there were no adjustments required to
derive Quanta’s net income attributable to common stock. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, a nominal number of stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices
of the stock options were greater than the average market price of Quanta’s common stock. The outstanding exchangeable shares of a Canadian subsidiary of Quanta that were issued pursuant to the acquisition of Valard Construction LP and certain
of its affiliated entities (Valard) on October 25, 2010, which are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis with shares of Quanta common stock, are included in weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share for the full
years of 2013, 2012 and 2011. Shares of Quanta common stock placed in escrow related to a previous acquisition are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2011, and are weighted based on the
portion of the year they were held in escrow. These shares were released from escrow on April 4, 2011.

Credit Facility

On October 30, 2013, Quanta entered into a credit agreement which amended and restated its prior credit agreement with
various lenders. The credit agreement provides for a $1.325 billion senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on October 30, 2018. Up to $400.0 million of the facility is available for revolving loans and letters of credit in certain
alternative currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar. The entire amount of the facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Up to $50.0 million of the facility is available for swing line loans in U.S. dollars, up to $30.0 million
of the facility is available for swing line loans in Canadian dollars and up to $20.0 million of the facility is available for swing line loans in Australian dollars. In addition, subject to the conditions specified in the credit agreement, Quanta
has the option to increase the revolving commitments under the credit agreement by up to an additional $300.0 million from time to time upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Borrowings under the credit agreement are to
be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2013, Quanta had approximately $240.3 million of letters of credit issued, $184.2 million of which was
denominated in U.S. dollars and $56.1 million of which was denominated in Australian and Canadian dollars, and no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. The remaining $1.08 billion was available for borrowings or issuing new letters of
credit. Information on credit facility borrowings and the applicable interest rates during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 is as follows (dollars in thousands):

Prior to April 1, 2014, amounts borrowed under the credit agreement in U.S. dollars bear

credit agreement in any currency other than U.S. dollars bear interest at a rate equal to the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.25%. Standby letters of credit issued under the credit agreement are subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.25%, and Performance
Letters of Credit (as defined in the credit agreement) issued under the credit agreement in support of certain contractual obligations are subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.75%. Quanta is also subject to a commitment fee of 0.20% on any unused
availability under the credit agreement.

Effective April 1, 2014, amounts borrowed under the credit agreement in
U.S. dollars will bear interest, at Quanta’s option, at a rate equal to either (a) the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.125% to 2.125%, as determined based



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

on Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as described below), or (b) the Base Rate plus 0.125% to 1.125%, as determined based on Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Amounts
borrowed as revolving loans under the credit agreement in any currency other than U.S. dollars will bear interest at a rate equal to the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.125% to 2.125%, as determined based on Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio.
Standby letters of credit issued under the credit agreement will be subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.125% to 2.125%, based on Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, and Performance Letters of Credit issued under the credit agreement in
support of certain contractual obligations will be subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.675% to 1.275%, based on Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Quanta also will be subject to a commitment fee of 0.20% to 0.40%, based on its
Consolidated Leverage Ratio, on any unused availability under the credit agreement.

The Consolidated Leverage Ratio is
the ratio of Quanta’s Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement). For purposes of calculating the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Funded Indebtedness is reduced by available cash and
Cash Equivalents (as defined in the credit agreement) in excess of $25.0 million. The Base Rate equals the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 1/2 of 1%, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate
and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.00%.

Subject to certain exceptions, the credit agreement is secured by
substantially all of the assets of Quanta and its wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries and by a pledge of all of the capital stock of Quanta’s wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of Quanta’s direct foreign subsidiaries of
Quanta’s wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries. Quanta’s wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries also guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the credit agreement. Subject to certain conditions, at any time Quanta maintains an Investment Grade
Rating (defined in the credit agreement as two of the following three conditions being met: (i) a corporate credit rating that is BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, (ii) a corporate family rating that is
Baa3 or higher by Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. or (iii) a corporate credit rating that is BBB- or higher by Fitch Ratings, Inc.), all collateral will automatically be released from these liens.

The credit agreement contains certain covenants, including a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and a Consolidated Interest
Coverage Ratio, in each case as specified in the credit agreement. The credit agreement limits certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, indebtedness, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits
liens on assets. The credit agreement also allows for cash payments for dividends and stock repurchases subject to compliance with the following requirements on a post-incurrence basis: (i) no default or event of default under the credit agreement;
(ii) continued compliance with the financial covenants described above; and (iii) at least $100 million of availability under the credit agreement and/or cash and cash equivalents on hand. As of December 31, 2013, Quanta was in compliance with
all of the covenants in the credit agreement.

The credit agreement provides for customary events of default and carries
cross-default provisions with Quanta’s underwriting, continuing indemnity and security agreement with its sureties and all of its other debt instruments exceeding $75.0 million in borrowings or availability. If an Event of Default (as defined
in the credit agreement) occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the credit agreement, amounts outstanding under the credit agreement may be accelerated and may become or be declared immediately due and
payable.

Between April 2, 2011 and October 30, 2013, Quanta had a credit agreement that provided for a $700.0
million senior secured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of August 2, 2016. Borrowings under the credit agreement were to be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures and other general
corporate purposes. Quanta entered into the credit agreement on August 2, 2011, which amended and restated its prior credit agreement.

Amounts borrowed under the credit agreement in U.S. dollars bore interest, at
Quanta’s option, at a rate equal to either (a) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 1.25% to 2.50%, as determined based on Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as described below), plus, if applicable, any
Mandatory Cost (as defined in the credit agreement) required to compensate lenders for the cost of compliance with certain European regulatory requirements, or (b) the Base Rate (as described below) plus 0.25% to 1.50%, as determined based on
Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Amounts borrowed under the credit agreement in any currency other than U.S. dollars bore interest at a rate equal to the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.25% to 2.50%, as determined based on Quanta’s
Consolidated Leverage Ratio, plus, if applicable, any Mandatory Cost. Standby letters of credit issued under the credit agreement were subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.25% to 2.50%, based on Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, and
Performance Letters of Credit (as defined in the credit agreement) issued under the credit agreement in support of certain contractual obligations were subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.75% to 1.50%, based on Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage
Ratio. Quanta was also subject to a commitment fee of 0.20% to 0.45%, based on Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, on any unused availability under the credit agreement. The Consolidated Leverage Ratio was the ratio of Quanta’s total
funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement). For purposes of calculating both the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and the maximum senior debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio discussed below, total funded debt and total senior
debt were reduced by all unrestricted cash and Cash Equivalents (as defined in the credit agreement) held by Quanta in excess of $25.0 million. The Base Rate equaled the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit agreement)
plus 1/2 of 1%, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.00%.

Prior to
August 2, 2011, Quanta had a credit agreement that provided for a $475.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on September 19, 2012. Subject to the conditions specified in the prior credit agreement, borrowings under
the prior credit facility were to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The entire unused portion of the prior credit facility was available for the issuance of letters of credit.

Amounts borrowed under the prior credit facility bore interest, at Quanta’s option, at a rate equal to either
(a) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the prior credit agreement) plus 0.875% to 1.75%, as determined by the ratio of Quanta’s total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the prior credit agreement), or (b) the base rate
(as described below) plus 0.00% to 0.75%, as determined by the ratio of Quanta’s total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA. Letters of credit issued under the prior credit facility were subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.875% to 1.75%, based
on the ratio of Quanta’s total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA. Quanta was also subject to a commitment fee of 0.15% to 0.35%, based on the ratio of its total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA, on any unused availability under the prior
credit facility. The base rate equaled the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the prior credit agreement) plus 1/2 of 1% or (ii) the bank’s prime rate.

The valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets at December 31, 2013, 2012 and
2011 was $15.6 million, $9.3 million and $8.8 million, respectively. These valuation allowances relate to foreign net operating loss carryforwards, state net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards. The net change in the
total valuation allowance for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was an increase of $6.3 million, an increase of $0.5 million and a decrease of $2.6 million, respectively. The valuation allowance was established primarily
as a result of uncertainty in Quanta’s outlook as to future taxable income in particular

tax jurisdictions. Quanta believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowances.

At December 31, 2013, Quanta had state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, the tax effect of which is
approximately $20.8 million. These carryforwards will expire as follows: 2014, $0.3 million; 2015, $0.1 million; 2016, $0.0 million; 2017, $0.7 million; 2018, $0.3 million and $19.4 million thereafter. A valuation allowance of $15.4 million has been
recorded against certain foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards.

Through December 31, 2013, Quanta has
not provided U.S. income taxes on approximately $218.0 million of unremitted foreign earnings because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. It is not practicable to determine the amount of any additional
U.S. tax liability that may result if Quanta decides to no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings outside the U.S. If Quanta’s intentions or U.S. tax laws change in the future, there may be a significant negative impact on the
provision for income taxes and cash flows, as a result of recording an incremental tax liability, in the period such change occurs.

Quanta classifies interest and penalties within the provision for income
taxes. Quanta recognized $0.3 million of interest income, $1.1 million of interest income and $0.7 million of interest expense in the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Quanta is subject to income tax in the United States, multiple state jurisdictions and some foreign jurisdictions. Quanta
remains open to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 through 2013 as these statute of limitations periods have not yet expired. Quanta does not consider any state in which it does business to be a major tax jurisdiction.

11.

EQUITY:

Exchangeable Shares and Series F Preferred Stock

In connection with the acquisition of Valard on October 25, 2010, certain former owners of Valard received exchangeable
shares of a Canadian subsidiary of Quanta which may be exchanged at the option of the holder for Quanta common stock on a one-for-one basis. The holders of exchangeable shares can make an exchange only once in any calendar quarter and must exchange
a minimum of either 50,000 shares or, if less, the total number of remaining exchangeable shares registered in the name of the holder making the request. Quanta also issued one share of Quanta Series F preferred stock to a voting trust on
behalf of the holders of the exchangeable shares. The Series F preferred stock provides the holders of the exchangeable shares voting rights in Quanta common stock equivalent to the number of exchangeable shares outstanding at any time. The
combination of the exchangeable shares and the share of Series F preferred stock gives the holders of the exchangeable shares rights equivalent to Quanta common stockholders with respect to dividends, voting and other economic rights. On
March 26, 2013, 409,110 exchangeable shares were exchanged for shares of Quanta common stock.

Limited Vote
Common Stock

Effective May 19, 2011, each outstanding share of Quanta’s Limited Vote Common Stock was
reclassified and converted into 1.05 shares of Quanta common stock, as set forth in a Certificate of Amendment to Restated Certificate of Incorporation approved by the stockholders of Quanta and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware on May 19, 2011. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, there were no shares of Limited Vote Common Stock outstanding. The Certificate of Amendment also eliminated entirely the class of Limited Vote Common Stock. The shares of Limited
Vote Common Stock had rights similar to shares of common stock, except with respect to voting. Holders of Limited Vote Common Stock were entitled to vote as a separate class to elect one director and did not vote in the election of other directors.
Holders of Limited Vote Common Stock were entitled to one-tenth of one vote for each share held on all other matters submitted for stockholder action. Shares of Limited Vote Common Stock were convertible into Quanta common stock upon disposition by
the holder of such shares in accordance with the transfer restrictions applicable to such shares. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, no shares of Limited Vote Common Stock were converted to common stock upon transfer.
In 2011, 432,485 shares of Limited Vote Common Stock were reclassified and converted into 454,107 shares of Quanta common stock pursuant to the Certificate of Amendment approved by the stockholders.

Treasury Stock

Under the stock incentive plans described in Note 12, the tax withholding obligations of employees upon vesting of
restricted stock awards and RSUs to be settled in common stock are typically satisfied by Quanta making such tax payments and withholding a number of vested shares having a value on the date of vesting equal to the tax withholding obligation. As a
result, Quanta withheld 379,566 shares of Quanta common stock in 2013



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

with a total market value of $12.1 million, 370,007 shares of Quanta common stock in 2012 with a total market value of $6.7 million, and 299,804 shares of Quanta common stock in 2011
with a total market value of $6.6 million, in each case for settlement of employee tax liabilities. These shares and the related cost to acquire them were accounted for as an adjustment to the balance of treasury stock. Under Delaware corporate law,
treasury stock is not counted for quorum purposes or entitled to vote.

During the fourth quarter of 2013, Quanta’s
board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing Quanta to purchase, from time to time, up to $500.0 million of its outstanding common stock through December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2013, there had been no repurchases
under this plan. The shares and the related cost to acquire them will be accounted for as an adjustment to the balance of treasury stock.

During the second quarter of 2011, Quanta’s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing Quanta to
purchase, from time to time, up to $150.0 million of its outstanding common stock. The program was completed in August 2011 and resulted in the repurchase of 8.1 million shares of Quanta’s common stock at an aggregate cost of $149.5
million. These shares and the related cost to acquire them were accounted for as an adjustment to the balance of treasury stock.

Noncontrolling Interests

Quanta holds investments in several joint ventures that provide infrastructure services under specific customer contracts. Each
joint venture is owned equally by its members. Quanta has determined that certain of these joint ventures are variable interest entities, with Quanta providing the majority of the infrastructure services to the joint venture, which management
believes most significantly influences the economic performance of the joint venture. Management has concluded that Quanta is the primary beneficiary of each of these joint ventures and has accounted for each on a consolidated basis. The other
parties’ equity interests in these joint ventures have been accounted for as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements. Income attributable to the other joint venture members has been accounted for as a reduction to net
income in order to obtain net income attributable to common stock in the amount of $19.4 million, $16.0 million and $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Equity in the consolidated assets and
liabilities of these joint ventures that is attributable to the other joint venture members has been accounted for as a component of noncontrolling interests within total equity in the accompanying balance sheets.

The carrying value of the investments held by Quanta in all of its variable interest entities was approximately $7.1 million
and $5.4 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012. The carrying value of investments held by the noncontrolling interests in these variable interest entities at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $7.1 million and $5.4 million. During the years
ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, distributions to noncontrolling interests were $17.6 million, $18.0 million and $6.0 million. There were no other changes in equity as a result of transfers to/from the noncontrolling interests during the
years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. See Note 15 for further disclosures related to Quanta’s joint venture arrangements.

EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION:

Stock Incentive Plans

On May 19, 2011, Quanta’s stockholders approved the Quanta Services, Inc. 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the
2011 Plan). The 2011 Plan provides for the award of non-qualified stock options, incentive (qualified) stock options (ISOs), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, stock bonus awards, performance compensation awards (including cash bonus
awards) or any combination of the foregoing. The purpose of the 2011 Plan is to provide participants with additional performance incentives by increasing their proprietary interest in Quanta. Employees, directors, officers, consultants or advisors
of Quanta or its affiliates



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

are eligible to participate in the 2011 Plan, as are prospective employees, directors, officers, consultants or advisors of Quanta who have agreed to serve Quanta in those capacities. An
aggregate of 11,750,000 shares of Quanta common stock may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2011 Plan.

Additionally, pursuant to the Quanta Services, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan), which was adopted on
May 24, 2007, Quanta may award restricted stock, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options to eligible employees, directors, and certain consultants and advisors. An aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of common stock may be issued
pursuant to awards granted under the 2007 Plan. Quanta also has a Restricted Stock Unit Plan (the RSU Plan), pursuant to which RSUs may be awarded to certain employees and consultants of Quanta’s Canadian operations. The 2011 Plan, the 2007
Plan and the RSU Plan, together with certain plans assumed by Quanta in acquisitions, are referred to as the Plans.

The
Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Quanta. The Compensation Committee has, subject to applicable regulation and the terms of the Plans, the authority to grant awards under the Plans, to construe and
interpret the Plans and to make all other determinations and take any and all actions necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plans. The Board also delegated to the Equity Grant Committee, a committee of the Board consisting of one or
more directors, the authority to grant limited awards to eligible persons who are not executive officers or non-employee directors.

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units to Be Settled in Common Stock

During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, Quanta granted 1.5 million, 1.3 million and
1.1 million shares of restricted stock and RSUs to be settled in common stock under the Plans with a weighted average grant date fair value price of $29.37, $21.84 and $21.38 per share, respectively. The grant date fair value for awards of
restricted stock and RSUs to be settled in common stock is based on the market value of Quanta common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock and RSUs to be settled in common stock are subject to forfeiture, restrictions on transfer and certain
other conditions until vesting, which generally occurs over three years in equal annual installments. During the restriction period, holders of restricted stock are entitled to vote and receive dividends on such shares.

During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, vesting activity consisted of 1.2 million, 0.9 million
and 0.8 million shares of restricted stock and RSUs settled in common stock with an approximate fair value at the time of vesting of $32.8 million, $22.3 million and $18.9 million, respectively. Vesting activity for the year ended
December 31, 2013 included compensation cost of approximately $4.3 million associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock and RSUs settled in common stock held by Quanta’s former Executive Chairman upon his retirement in May
2013.

December 31, 2013 is as follows (shares in thousands):

As of December 31, 2013, there was approximately $28.9 million of total
unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock and RSUs to be settled in common stock granted to both employees and non-employees. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.68 years.

Restricted Stock Units To Be Settled in Cash

Certain RSUs granted by Quanta under the Plans are intended to provide plan participants with cash performance incentives that
are substantially equivalent to the risks and rewards of equity ownership in Quanta. These RSUs to be settled in cash vest over a designated period, typically three years, and are subject to forfeiture under certain conditions, primarily termination
of service. Upon vesting of these RSUs, the holders receive for each vested RSU an amount in cash equal to the fair market value on the vesting date of one share of Quanta common stock, as specified in the applicable award agreement.

Compensation expense related to RSUs to be settled in cash was $3.1 million, $2.0 million and $1.3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Such expense is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. RSUs that may be settled only in cash are not included in the calculation of earnings per share, and the estimated earned value of such
RSUs is classified as a liability. Quanta paid $1.8 million, $1.7 million and $1.0 million to settle liabilities related to cash-settled RSUs in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Liabilities recorded for the
estimated earned value of the RSUs outstanding to be settled in cash were $2.1 million and $0.8 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

Unions’ Multi-Employer Pension Plans

Quanta contributes to a number of multi-employer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining
agreements with various unions that represent certain of Quanta’s employees. Quanta’s multi-employer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in the collective bargaining agreements (usually on an annual basis), and
contributions are made to the plans on a “pay-as-you-go” basis based on its union employee payrolls. Quanta may also have additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of its participation in multi-employer defined benefit pension
plans. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon an employer who is a contributor to a multi-employer pension plan if the employer
withdraws from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. In the fourth quarter of 2011, Quanta recorded a partial withdrawal liability of approximately $32.6 million related to the withdrawal by certain Quanta subsidiaries
from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (Central States Plan) following an amendment to the applicable collective bargaining agreement which eliminated their obligations to contribute to the Central States Plan. See
further information regarding the withdrawal from the Central States Plan as well as the withdrawal of a company acquired in the fourth quarter of 2013 from the Central States Plan in

Collective Bargaining Agreements

in Note 15.

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the PPA) also added special funding and operational rules generally applicable to plan
years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status based on multiple factors (including, for example, the plan’s funded percentage,
cash flow position and whether it is projected to experience a minimum funding deficiency). Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, as applicable, which
may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. Certain plans to which Quanta contributes or may contribute in the future are in
“endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical”



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

status. The amount of additional funds, if any, that Quanta may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated due to the uncertainty of the future levels of work
that require the specific use of union employees covered by these plans, as well as the future contribution levels and possible surcharges on contributions applicable to these plans.

The following table summarizes plan information relating to Quanta’s participation in multi-employer defined benefit
pension plans, including company contributions for the last three years, the status under the PPA of the plans and whether the plans are subject to a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan or contribution surcharges. The most recent PPA zone
status available in 2013 and 2012 relates to the plan’s fiscal year-end in 2012 and 2011. Forms 5500 were not yet available for the plan years ending in 2013. The PPA zone status is based on information that Quanta received from the respective
plans, as well as publicly available information on the U.S. Department of Labor website, and is certified by the plan’s actuary. Although multiple factors or tests may result in red zone or yellow zone status, plans in the red zone generally
are less than 65 percent funded, plans in the yellow zone generally are less than 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone generally are at least 80 percent funded. Under the PPA, red zone plans are classified as “critical” status,
yellow zone plans are classified as “endangered” status and green zone plans are classified as neither “endangered” nor “critical” status. The “Subject to Financial Improvement/ Rehabilitation Plan” column
indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (FIP) or a rehabilitation plan (RP) is either pending or has been implemented. The last column lists the expiration dates of Quanta’s collective-bargaining agreements to which the plans are
subject. Total contributions to these plans correspond to the number of union employees employed at any given time and the plans in which they participate and varies depending upon the location and number of ongoing projects at a given time and the
need for union resources in connection with such projects. Information has been presented separately for individually significant plans and in the aggregate for all other plans.

Quanta effected a complete withdrawal from the Central States, Southeast, and Southwest Areas
Pension Plan as of December 31, 2012.

Quanta’s contributions to the following plans were five
percent or more of the total contributions to these plans for the periods indicated based on the Forms 5500 for these plans. Forms 5500 were not yet available for these plans for the year ended December 31, 2013.

In addition to the contributions made to multi-employer defined benefit pension plans noted
above, Quanta also contributed to multi-employer defined contribution or other benefit plans on behalf of certain union employees. Contributions to union multi-employer defined contribution or other benefit plans by Quanta were approximately
$104.4 million, $87.0 million and $46.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Total contributions made to these plans for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 correspond to the number of
union employees employed at any given time and the plans in which they participate and varies depending upon the location and number of ongoing projects at a given time and the need for union resources in connection with such projects.

Quanta maintains a 401(k) plan pursuant to which employees who are not provided retirement benefits through a collective
bargaining agreement may make contributions through a payroll deduction. Quanta makes matching cash contributions of 100% of each employee’s contribution up to 3% of that employee’s salary and 50% of each employee’s contribution
between 3% and 6% of such employee’s salary, up to the maximum amount permitted by law. Contributions to non-union defined contribution plans by Quanta were approximately $11.8 million, $11.0 million and $9.5 million for the years ended
December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

Certain of Quanta’s operating units have entered into related party lease arrangements for operational
facilities, typically with prior owners of certain acquired businesses. These lease agreements generally have terms of up to five years and include renewal options. Related party lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and
2011 was approximately $4.6 million, $4.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

Investments in Affiliates and Other Entities

As described in Note 11, Quanta holds investments in certain joint ventures with third parties for the purpose of
providing infrastructure services under certain customer contracts. Losses incurred by these joint ventures are generally shared equally by the joint venture members. However, each member of the joint venture typically is jointly and severally
liable for all of the obligations of the joint venture under the contract with the customer and therefore can be liable for full performance of the contract with the customer. In circumstances where Quanta’s participation in a joint venture
qualifies as a general partnership, the joint venture partners are jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of the joint venture including obligations owed to the customer or any other person or entity. Quanta is not aware of
circumstances that would lead to future claims against it for material amounts in connection with these joint and several liabilities.

In the joint venture arrangements entered into by Quanta, typically each joint venturer indemnifies the other party for any
liabilities incurred in excess of the liabilities such other party is obligated to bear under the respective joint venture agreement. It is possible, however, that Quanta could be required to pay or perform obligations in excess of its share if the
other joint venturer failed or refused to pay or perform its share of the obligations. Quanta is not aware of circumstances that would lead to future claims against it for material amounts that would not be indemnified.

As of December 31, 2013, Quanta has outstanding capital commitments associated with investments in unconsolidated
affiliates related to planned midstream infrastructure projects of approximately $13.1 million. Quanta is unable to determine the timing of these capital commitments but anticipates them to be paid before the end of 2015.

Leases

Quanta leases certain land, buildings and equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements, including related party leases as
discussed in Note 14. The terms of these agreements vary from lease to lease, including some with renewal options and escalation clauses. The following schedule shows the future minimum lease payments under these leases as of December 31,
2013 (in thousands):

Rent expense related to operating leases was approximately $112.8 million, $92.3 million and
$110.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Quanta has guaranteed the
residual value on certain of its equipment operating leases. Quanta has agreed to pay any difference between this residual value and the fair market value of the underlying asset at the date of termination of the leases. At December 31, 2013,
the maximum guaranteed residual value was approximately $304.8 million. Quanta believes that no significant payments will be made as a result of the difference between the fair market value of the leased equipment and the guaranteed residual value.
However, there can be no assurance that significant payments will not be required in the future.

Committed Capital
Expenditures

Quanta has committed capital for the expansion of its fiber optic network, although Quanta typically
does not commit capital to new network expansions until it has a committed licensing arrangement in place with at least one customer. The amounts of committed capital expenditures are estimates of costs required to build the networks under contract.
The actual capital expenditures related to building the networks could vary materially from these estimates. As of December 31, 2013, Quanta estimates these committed capital expenditures to be approximately $38.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014. Quanta also committed capital for the expansion of its vehicle fleet in order to accommodate manufacturer lead times on certain types of vehicles. As of December 31, 2013, production orders for approximately $13.7
million had been issued with delivery dates expected to occur throughout 2014. Although Quanta has committed to purchase these vehicles at the time of their delivery, Quanta intends that these orders will be assigned to third party leasing companies
and made available to Quanta under certain of its master equipment lease agreements, thereby releasing Quanta from its capital commitment.

Litigation and Claims

Quanta is from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract and/or property damages, employment-related damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or
declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

proceedings, Quanta records a reserve when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Quanta discloses matters for which
management believes a material loss is at least reasonably possible. Except as otherwise stated below, none of these proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect on Quanta’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. In all instances, management has assessed the matter based on current information and made a judgment concerning its potential outcome, giving due consideration to the nature of the claim, the amount
and nature of damages sought and the probability of success. Management’s judgment may prove materially inaccurate, and such judgment is made subject to the known uncertainties of litigation.

California Fire Claim

— Amador County. In October 2004, a wildfire in Amador County, California, burned
16,800 acres. The United States Forest Service alleged that the fire originated as a result of the activities of a Quanta subsidiary crew performing vegetation management under a contract with Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E). In
November 2007, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) sent a written demand to the Quanta subsidiary for payment of fire suppression costs of approximately $8.5 million. Quanta recorded a liability and corresponding insurance recovery
receivable of approximately $8.5 million associated with this matter based on the written demand received from the USDA.

The USDA informally communicated that it also intended to seek past and future restoration and other damages of approximately
$51.3 million, as well as other unspecified damages. PG&E tendered defense and indemnification for the matter to Quanta in 2010. On August 3, 2012, the USDA filed suit in the United States District Court, Eastern District of California,
against Quanta, its subsidiary and PG&E, seeking unspecified damages for fire suppression costs, rehabilitation and restoration expenses, and loss of timber, habitat and environmental values, among other things, including recovery of fees and
expenses.

During the first quarter of 2013, a settlement-in-principle was reached with the USDA, subject to approval by
the United States Department of Justice, for an amount within Quanta’s available insurance coverages. The Department of Justice approved the settlement during the second quarter of 2013, and this matter has been concluded within Quanta’s
available insurance.

National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Arbitration.

On October 1, 2010, Mears
Group, Inc. (Mears), a wholly owned subsidiary of Quanta, filed a request for arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in London against the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago (NGC). The request for arbitration arises
out of a contract between Mears and NGC for horizontal directional drilling (HDD) services in connection with a shore approach of a natural gas pipeline. During pullback of the pipeline, a component on the drill rig operated by Mears failed, and the
pipeline was lodged downhole. Subsequent efforts to salvage the pipeline by NGC, Mears and other parties failed to dislodge the pipeline. NGC subsequently hired a separate HDD contractor to complete reworks.

Mears alleges breach of contract, among other things, and seeks recovery for works performed, standby costs, demobilization
costs, and other expenses, totaling approximately $16.5 million, including taxes, and additionally seeks recovery of pre-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees and expenses. Mears contends in the arbitration that NGC breached the contract
between the parties by providing a pipeline with insufficient buoyancy, weighing significantly more than the weight specified in the contract. In addition, Mears argues that NGC failed to provide a contractually required builders all-risk insurance
policy naming Mears as an additional insured, which would have covered losses associated with a pullback failure. Moreover, Mears asserts that NGC agreed to indemnify Mears for losses to NGC’s equipment for events occurring during the project,
and that any recovery by NGC is therefore barred.



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

NGC counterclaimed in the arbitration, asserting that Mears breached the
contract and performed negligently by failing to provide a drilling component capable of withstanding loads during pullback and providing a hole of insufficient cleanliness such that debris and other materials contributed to excess forces
experienced during Mears’ pullback of the pipeline. NGC seeks recovery for the costs of the salvage operations, the cost of the reworks, as well as other costs, totaling approximately $79.5 million, and additionally seeks recovery of
pre-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees and expenses.

The arbitration hearings were completed during the third
quarter of 2012, but no decision has been rendered. Mears also notified its insurers of the counterclaims, and although coverage was denied, Mears is continuing to pursue its insurers for coverage. Due to the nature of these claims, however, an
adverse result in these proceedings could result in a significant uninsured loss that could have a material adverse effect on Quanta’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Sunrise Powerlink Arbitration

. On April 21, 2010, PAR, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Quanta, entered into a contract
with SDG&E to construct a 117-mile electrical transmission line in Imperial and San Diego Counties, California, known as the Sunrise Powerlink project. Construction commenced on November 17, 2010, with commercial operations beginning on June 17,
2012, according to SDG&E. During the construction phase, SDG&E directed multiple changes to the construction schedule which required PAR to significantly increase its resources to the project in order to meet the customer required completion
date. The project also experienced numerous impacts beyond PAR’s control such as access delays and restrictions, as well as problems with customer supplied materials to the project. Following completion of the project, PAR and SDG&E had
ongoing meetings to review project scope, costs and performance criteria in order to reach resolution on the additional work performed and pricing of the change order under the contract, which resulted in PAR and SDG&E being in agreement as to
PAR’s direct costs incurred in completing the project. Although the parties agreed upon PAR’s direct costs, the parties have been unsuccessful in agreeing on the final amount owed to PAR.

As a result, PAR initiated arbitration proceedings in the fourth quarter of 2013 pursuant to a contractually agreed upon
dispute resolution process. PAR contends that SDG&E breached its obligations under the contract and that, as a result, PAR is entitled to compensation in excess of $165 million plus interest and other relief that PAR may be entitled to under the
contract and applicable law. In response, SDG&E has now disputed that PAR is entitled to the payment of any such additional amounts. On November 18, 2013, SDG&E set forth a counterclaim, which was clarified on January 24, 2014 to
seek damages from PAR of approximately $32 million, for PAR’s alleged untimely performance and breach of the contract. Quanta believes that SDG&E’s assertions are without merit and that PAR is entitled to the amount sought in the
arbitration process. The parties have initiated discovery and the matter is set for hearing before the arbitration panel in March 2015. Although Quanta believes it is entitled to the amount PAR is seeking, due to the nature of these proceedings, an
adverse result in this matter could have a material adverse effect on Quanta’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Quanta is subject to concentrations of credit risk related primarily to its cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable,
including amounts related to unbilled accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. Substantially all of Quanta’s cash investments are managed by what it believes to be high credit quality
financial institutions. In accordance with Quanta’s investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest this cash in a diversified portfolio of what Quanta believes to be high quality investments, which consist primarily of
interest-bearing demand deposits, money market mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper with original maturities of three months or less. Although Quanta does not currently believe the principal amount of these investments is subject to
any material risk of loss, changes in



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

economic conditions could impact the interest income Quanta receives from these investments. In addition, Quanta grants credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, to its
customers, which include electric power, oil and gas companies, governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the United States and Canada. Consequently,
Quanta is subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the United States and Canada, which may be heightened as a result of uncertain economic and financial market conditions that have existed in
recent years. However, Quanta generally has certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Historically, some of Quanta’s customers have experienced significant financial difficulties, and others may experience financial
difficulties in the future. These difficulties expose Quanta to increased risk related to collectability of billed and unbilled receivables and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts for services Quanta has
performed.

As of December 31, 2013, two customers accounted for approximately 15% and 11% of Quanta’s
consolidated net position, which includes accounts receivable (including long-term balances and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts), less billings in excess of costs and unearned revenue. As of
December 31, 2012, the same two customers accounted for approximately 16% and 11% of consolidated net position. The services provided to these customers relate primarily to Quanta’s Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.
Substantially all of the balance for the customer with 11% of consolidated net position as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 relates to the Sunrise Powerlink project with a long-term receivable balance related to a significant change order that is
subject to a contractually agreed upon arbitration process. During the third quarter of 2013, Quanta reclassified the receivable related to this matter from costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts to other assets, net due to the
expected timetable for resolution of the matter. For additional information, see

Litigation and Claims — Sunrise Powerlink Arbitration

within this Note 15. Additionally, the customer with the 11% of consolidated net position at
December 31, 2013 and 2012 also accounted for 11% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. No other customers represented 10% or more of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, and no other
customers represented 10% or more of consolidated net position as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.

Self-Insurance

Quanta is insured for employer’s liability, general liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation claims. On
August 1, 2013, Quanta renewed its employer’s liability, general liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation policies for the 2013 — 2014 policy year. As a result of the renewal, the deductibles for general liability and
auto liability increased from $5.0 million to $10.0 million per occurrence, while the deductible for workers’ compensation remained at $5.0 million per occurrence and the deductible for employer’s liability remained at $1.0 million per
occurrence. Additionally, in connection with this renewal, the amount of letters of credit required by Quanta to secure its obligations under its casualty insurance programs, which is discussed further below, has increased. Quanta also has employee
health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $375,000 per claimant per year.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based upon Quanta’s estimate of the ultimate liability for
claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent
of damage, the determination of Quanta’s liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate. As of
December 31, 2013 and 2012, the gross amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $161.8 million and $160.8 million, with $122.6 million and $120.2 million considered to be long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Related
insurance recoveries/receivables



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $9.1 million and $22.2 million, of which $0.7 million and $2.3 million are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $8.4 million and
$19.9 million are included in other assets, net.

Quanta renews its insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore
deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel Quanta’s coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or Quanta may elect not to obtain certain types or incremental
levels of insurance if it believes that the cost to obtain such coverage exceeds the additional benefits obtained. In any such event, Quanta’s overall risk exposure would increase, which could negatively affect its results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.

Letters of Credit

Certain of Quanta’s vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on its
behalf, such as to beneficiaries under its self-funded insurance programs. In addition, from time to time, certain customers require Quanta to post letters of credit to ensure payment to its subcontractors and vendors and to guarantee performance
under its contracts. Such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution, typically pursuant to Quanta’s credit facility. Each letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the
letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that Quanta has failed to perform specified actions. If this were to occur, Quanta would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement,
Quanta may also be required to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. Quanta does not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2013, Quanta had $240.3 million in letters of credit outstanding under its credit facility primarily
to secure obligations under its casualty insurance program. These are irrevocable stand-by letters of credit with maturities generally expiring at various times throughout 2014. Upon maturity, it is expected that the majority of these letters of
credit will be renewed for subsequent one-year periods.

Performance Bonds and Parent Guarantees

In certain circumstances, Quanta is required to provide performance bonds in connection with its contractual commitments.
Quanta has indemnified its sureties for any expenses paid out under these performance bonds. As of December 31, 2013, the total amount of outstanding performance bonds was approximately $2.68 billion, and the estimated cost to complete these
bonded projects was approximately $671.4 million.

Quanta, from time to time, guarantees the obligations of its wholly
owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease obligations and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors’ licenses. Quanta is not aware of any material obligations for
performance or payment asserted against it under any of these guarantees.

Employment Agreements

Quanta has various employment agreements with certain executives and other employees, which provide for compensation and
certain other benefits and for severance payments under certain circumstances. Certain employment agreements also contain clauses that become effective upon a change of control of Quanta. Quanta may be obligated to pay certain amounts to such
employees upon the occurrence of any of the defined events in the various employment agreements.



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Collective Bargaining Agreements

Some of Quanta’s operating units are parties to various collective bargaining agreements with unions that represent
certain of their employees. The collective bargaining agreements expire at various times and have typically been renegotiated and renewed on terms similar to those in the expiring agreements. The agreements require the operating units to pay
specified wages, provide certain benefits to their union employees and contribute certain amounts to multi-employer pension plans and employee benefit trusts. Quanta’s multiemployer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in the
collective bargaining agreements (usually on an annual basis), and contributions are made to the plans on a “pay-as-you-go” basis based on its union employee payrolls, which cannot be determined for future periods because the location and
number of union employees that Quanta employs at any given time and the plans in which they may participate vary depending on the projects Quanta has ongoing at any time and the need for union resources in connection with those projects.

The PPA also added special funding and operational rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for
multi-employer plans that are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status based on multiple factors (including, for example, the plan’s funded percentage, cash flow position and whether
it is projected to experience a minimum funding deficiency). Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, as applicable, which may require additional
contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. Certain plans to which Quanta contributes or may contribute in the future are in “endangered,”
“seriously endangered” or “critical” status. The amount of additional funds, if any, that Quanta may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated due to uncertainty of the future levels of work that
require the specific use of union employees covered by these plans, as well as the future contribution levels and possible surcharges on contributions applicable to these plans.

Quanta may be subject to additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of its participation in multi-employer defined
benefit pension plans. For example, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon an employer who is a contributor to a multi-employer
pension plan if the employer withdraws from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. These liabilities include an allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits in the plan for all plan participants, not merely the
benefits payable to a contributing employer’s own retirees. As a result, participating employers may bear a higher proportion of liability for unfunded vested benefits if other participating employers cease to contribute or withdraw, with the
reallocation of liability being more acute in cases when a withdrawn employer is insolvent or otherwise fails to pay its withdrawal liability. Other than as described below, Quanta is not aware of any material amounts of withdrawal liability that
have been incurred as a result of a withdrawal by any of Quanta’s operating units from any multi-employer defined benefit pension plans.

In the fourth quarter of 2011, Quanta recorded a partial withdrawal liability of approximately $32.6 million related to the
withdrawal by certain Quanta subsidiaries from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (the Central States Plan). The partial withdrawal liability recognized by Quanta was based on estimates received from the Central States
Plan during 2011 for a complete withdrawal by all Quanta companies participating in the Central States Plan. The withdrawal followed an amendment to a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters that eliminated
obligations to contribute to the Central States Plan, which is in critical status and is significantly underfunded as to its vested benefit obligations. The amendment was negotiated by the Pipe Line Contractors Association (PLCA) on behalf of its
members, which include the Quanta subsidiaries that withdrew from the Central States Plan. Quanta believed that withdrawing from the Central States Plan in the fourth quarter of 2011 was advantageous because it limited



QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Quanta’s exposure to increased liabilities from a future withdrawal if the underfunded status of the Central States Plan deteriorates further. Quanta and other PLCA members now contribute to
a different multi-employer pension plan on behalf of Teamsters employees.

The Central States Plan has asserted that the
withdrawal of the PLCA members was not effective in 2011, although Quanta believes that a legally effective withdrawal occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011. During the third quarter of 2012, the Central States Plan provided Quanta with an estimate
of the potential withdrawal liability, indicating that the withdrawal liability is approximately $32.8 million based on a partial withdrawal in the fourth quarter of 2011, approximately $39.7 million based on a partial withdrawal in the first
quarter of 2012, or approximately $40.1 million based on a complete withdrawal in 2012. Certain other Quanta subsidiaries continued participation in the Central States Plan, and Quanta subsequently effected a complete withdrawal as of
December 31, 2012. The consequences of the complete withdrawal of Quanta’s subsidiaries from the plan will depend on various factors, including interpretations of the terms of the collective bargaining agreements under which the
subsidiaries participated and whether exemptions from withdrawal liability applicable to construction industry employers will be available. Based on the previous estimate of liability associated with a complete withdrawal from the Central States
Plan, and allowing for the exclusion of amounts believed by management to have been improperly included in such estimate, Quanta will seek to challenge and further negotiate the amount owed in connection with this matter. In December 2013, Central
States filed a lawsuit against certain of Quanta’s subsidiaries alleging that contributions made to a new industry fund, which was created after Quanta withdrew from the Central States Plan, should have been made to the Central States Plan.
Quanta has disputed these allegations on the basis that it has properly provided contributions to the new industry fund based on the terms of the collective bargaining agreements under which its subsidiaries participate. Given the unknown nature of
some of these factors, the final withdrawal liability cannot yet be determined with certainty; therefore the ultimate amount owed upon final settlement of these matters could be materially higher than the $32.6 million Quanta recognized in the
fourth quarter of 2011.

Additionally, on October 9, 2013, Quanta acquired a company that experienced a complete
withdrawal from the Central States Plan prior to the date of acquisition. Central States issued a notice and demand, dated March 13, 2013, to the acquired company for a withdrawal liability in the total amount of $6.9 million payable in
installments. Based on legal arguments, the acquired company took the position that the amount of withdrawal liability payable to Central States as a result of its complete withdrawal was $4.8 million, of which approximately $4.3 million was not yet
paid and accrued as of December 31, 2013. The acquired company, and now Quanta, has taken steps to challenge the amount of the assessment by the Central States Plan; however, payments in accordance with the terms of the Central States
demand letter are required to be made while the dispute is ongoing. In addition, $2.1 million of the cash proceeds related to the sale were deposited into an escrow account on October 9, 2013 to fund any additional obligation beyond the
$4.8 million. Accordingly, the acquired company’s withdrawal from the Central States Plan is not expected to have a material impact on Quanta’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Indemnities

Quanta generally indemnifies its customers for the services it provides under its contracts, as well as other specified
liabilities, which may subject Quanta to indemnity claims and liabilities and related litigation. Quanta has also indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with Quanta’s
previous acquisition or disposition of certain companies. The indemnities under acquisition or disposition agreements are usually contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December 31, 2013,
except as otherwise set forth above in

Litigation and Claims

, Quanta does not believe any material liabilities for asserted claims exist against it in connection with any of these indemnity obligations.

SEGMENT INFORMATION:

Quanta presents its operations under three reportable segments: (1) Electric Power Infrastructure
Services, (2) Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services and (3) Fiber Optic Licensing and Other. This structure is generally based on the broad end-user markets for Quanta’s services. See Note 1 for additional information regarding
Quanta’s reportable segments.

Quanta’s segment results are derived from the types of services provided across
its operating units in each of the end user markets described above. Quanta’s entrepreneurial business model allows each of its operating units to serve the same or similar customers and to provide a range of services across end user markets.
Quanta’s operating units are organized into one of three internal divisions, namely, the electric power division, oil and gas infrastructure division and fiber optic division. These internal divisions are closely aligned with the reportable
segments described above based on their operating units’ predominant type of work.

Reportable segment information,
including revenues and operating income by type of work, is gathered from each operating unit for the purpose of evaluating segment performance in support of Quanta’s market strategies. These classifications of Quanta’s operating unit
revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the part of management. Quanta’s operating units may perform joint infrastructure service projects for customers in multiple industries, deliver multiple
types of network services under a single customer contract or provide service across industries, for example, joint trenching projects to install distribution lines for electric power and natural gas customers.

In addition, Quanta’s integrated operations and common administrative support at each of its operating units require that
certain allocations, including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs, indirect operating expenses, including depreciation, and general and administrative costs, to determine operating segment profitability. Corporate
costs, such as payroll and benefits, employee travel expenses, facility costs, professional fees, acquisition costs and amortization related to certain intangible assets are not allocated.

Separate measures of Quanta’s assets and cash flows by reportable segment, including
capital expenditures, are not produced or utilized by management to evaluate segment performance. Quanta’s fixed assets, which are held at the operating unit level, include operating machinery, equipment and vehicles, as well as office
equipment, buildings and leasehold improvements, are used on an interchangeable basis across its reportable segments. As such, for reporting purposes, total depreciation expense is allocated each quarter among Quanta’s reportable segments based
on the ratio of each reportable segment’s revenue contribution to consolidated revenues.

Foreign Operations

During 2013, 2012, and 2011, Quanta derived $1.31 billion, $861.5 million and $535.0 million, respectively, of its
revenues from foreign operations. Of Quanta’s foreign revenues, approximately 86%, 96% and 97% was earned in Canada during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, Quanta held property and equipment of
$196.8 million and $151.9 million in foreign countries, primarily Canada, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. The increases in foreign revenues and assets are primarily due to the timing of the non-U.S. acquisitions described in Note 5.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS:

Acquisitions

During the first quarter of 2014, Quanta has completed five acquisitions. Four of these five companies are electric power
infrastructure services companies located in Canada. The fifth company is a general engineering and construction company, based in California, specializing in hydrant fueling, waterfront and utility construction for U.S. Department of Defense
military bases and will generally be included in Quanta’s Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment. The aggregate consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $79.9 million in cash, 393,051 shares of Quanta common
stock and 899,858 exchangeable shares of a Canadian subsidiary of Quanta that are substantially equivalent to, and exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for, Quanta common stock. In addition, Quanta issued one share of Series G preferred stock with
voting rights equivalent to Quanta common stock equal to the number of exchangeable shares outstanding at any time. The aggregate value of the above issued securities on the respective closing dates of the acquisitions totaled approximately $36.6
million. As these transactions were effective during the first quarter of 2014, the results will be included in Quanta’s consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective dates of acquisition. These acquisitions should enable Quanta
to further enhance its electric power infrastructure service offerings in Canada and its oil and gas infrastructure service offerings in the U.S.



ITEM 9.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

There have been no changes in or disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure within the parameters of
Item 304(b) of Regulation S-K.

ITEM 9A.

Controls and Procedures

Attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K are certifications of Quanta’s Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer that are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). This

“Controls and Procedures”

section includes information concerning the controls
and controls evaluation referred to in the certifications, and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management has established and maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC rules and forms. The disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

As of the end of the period covered by this
Annual Report, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on this evaluation, these officers have concluded that, as of December 31, 2013, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide
reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.

Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting can be found in Item 8 of this Annual Report under
the heading “Report of Management” and is incorporated herein by reference. The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, on the financial statements, and its opinion on the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, can also be found in Item 8 of this Annual Report under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” and is incorporated herein by reference.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
December 31, 2013, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Design and Operation of Control Systems

Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control
system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances



of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because of
simple errors or mistakes. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
