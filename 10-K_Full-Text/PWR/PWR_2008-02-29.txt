PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

General

Quanta Services, Inc. (Quanta) is a leading specialized
    contracting services company, delivering

end-to-end

network solutions to the electric power, gas, telecommunications
    and cable television industries. Our comprehensive services
    include designing, installing, repairing and maintaining network
    infrastructure. With operations in all 50 states and
    Canada, we have the manpower, resources and expertise to
    complete projects that are local, regional, national or
    international in scope.

On August 30, 2007, Quanta acquired, through a merger
    transaction (the Merger), all of the outstanding common stock of
    InfraSource Services, Inc. (InfraSource). For accounting
    purposes, the transaction was effective as of August 31,
    2007, and results of InfraSource’s operations have been
    included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to
    August 31, 2007. Similar to Quanta, InfraSource provided
    specialized infrastructure contracting services to the electric
    power, gas and telecommunications industries primarily in the
    United States. The acquisition enhanced and expanded our
    footprint, enhanced capabilities in our existing service areas
    and added a dark fiber leasing business that involves the
    leasing of

point-to-point

telecommunications infrastructure in select markets.

We believe that we are one of the largest contractors serving
    the transmission and distribution sector of the North American
    electric utility industry. Our consolidated revenues for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 were approximately
    $2.66 billion, of which 57% was attributable to electric
    power work, 14% to gas work, 17% to telecommunications and cable
    television work and 12% to ancillary services, such as inside
    electrical wiring, intelligent traffic networks, fueling
    systems, cable and control systems for light rail lines,
    airports and highways and specialty rock trenching, directional
    boring and road milling for industrial and commercial customers.
    We were organized as a corporation in the state of Delaware in
    1997 and since that time have made strategic acquisitions and
    grown organically to expand our geographic presence, generate
    operating synergies with existing businesses and develop new
    capabilities to meet our customers’ evolving needs.

We have established a nationwide presence with a workforce of
    over 15,000 employees, which enables us to quickly and
    reliably serve our diversified customer base. Our customers
    include many of the leading companies in the industries we serve.

Representative customers include:

•

American Electric Power

•

AT&T

•

BC Transmission Corporation

We believe our reputation for responsiveness, performance,
    geographic reach and a comprehensive service offering has also
    enabled us to develop strong strategic alliances with numerous
    customers.

Industry
    Overview

We estimate that the total amount of annual outsourced
    infrastructure spending in the four primary industries we serve
    is in excess of $30 billion. We believe that we are one of
    the largest specialty contractors



providing services for the installation and maintenance of
    network infrastructure and that we and four other large
    specialty contractors providing these services account for less
    than 15% of this market. Smaller, typically private companies
    provide the balance of these services.

We expect the following industry trends to impact demand for our
    services in the future, although we cannot predict the timing or
    magnitude of that impact:

Need to upgrade electric power transmission and distribution
    networks.

The U.S. and Canadian electric
    power grid, which consists of more than 200,000 miles of
    high-voltage lines delivering electricity to over
    300 million people, is aging and requires significant
    maintenance and expansion to handle the nation’s current
    and growing power needs. In addition, the grid must facilitate
    the sale of electricity across competitive regional networks, a
    function for which it was not originally designed. According to
    the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), industry
    professionals rank the aging infrastructure and limited new
    construction as the number one challenge to reliability of the
    transmission system.

While the grid continues to deteriorate, demand for electricity
    is expected to continue to grow. According to the 2008 Annual
    Energy Outlook published by the U.S. Department of
    Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA),
    population in the United States has increased by about 20% since
    1990, with energy consumption increasing by a comparable 18%.
    The EIA also projects in the same report that total
    U.S. electricity sales from producers to consumers will
    increase by 41% from 3,660 billion

kilowatt-hours

in 2005 to 5,168 billion

kilowatt-hours

in 2030. NERC reports in its 2007 Long-Term Reliability
    Assessment that peak demand for electricity in the U.S., which
    typically occurs in the summer, is forecast to increase by
    135,000 megawatts or 17.7% over the next ten years.

This increasing demand for electricity, coupled with the aging
    infrastructure, is expected to result in increased spending on
    transmission and distribution systems. According to an Edison
    Electric Institute (EEI) report published in January 2008,
    investor-owned utilities spent a total of $6.9 billion on
    their transmission systems in 2006 and plan to invest an
    additional $38.1 billion in their transmission systems from
    2007 to 2010. This represents a 60% increase over the amount
    invested from 2003 to 2006. NERC projects the number of
    transmission miles will increase by 8.8% or 14,500 circuit miles
    in the U.S. over the next ten years. We believe spending
    levels will continue to increase as utilities work to address
    infrastructure maintenance requirements, as well as the future
    reliability standards required by the Energy Policy Act of 2005
    (Energy Act).

The Energy Policy Act of 2005.

We expect the
    Energy Act, which was enacted in August 2005, to result in
    increased spending by the power industry over the next decade.
    Since enactment, several aspects of the Energy Act have come
    into effect and, as a result, have better positioned utilities
    to finance and implement system enhancements. The objectives of
    the Energy Act include improving the nation’s electric
    transmission capacity and reliability and promoting investment
    in the nation’s energy infrastructure. It provides for a
    self-regulating reliability organization to implement and
    enforce mandatory reliability standards on all market
    participants, with oversight by the Federal Energy Regulatory
    Commission (FERC). FERC has issued rules to provide a more
    favorable return on equity for transmission system owners, and
    it has approved incentive rates to encourage transmission
    expansion and help ensure reliability in certain regions of the
    nation.

A significant provision of the Energy Act is the repeal of a
    longstanding barrier to effective competition — the
    Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). We believe
    the repeal of PUHCA opens the electricity and natural gas
    sectors to new sources of investment in necessary energy
    infrastructure.

We also anticipate that other aspects of the Energy Act will
    make investment in the nation’s transmission system more
    attractive and lead to a streamlined permitting process. The
    Energy Act provides for the designation of National Interest
    Electric Transmission Corridors (NIETCs) to facilitate siting of
    new transmission infrastructure.  In October 2007, the
    Department of Energy (DOE) designated two NIETCs — the
    Mid-Atlantic Area National Corridor and the Southwest Area
    National Corridor. These NIETCs include two of the nation’s
    most populated regions with major transmission
    congestion — the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region and the
    Southwest region. The NIETCs will be in effect for 12 years
    to give regional transmission owners and utilities time to
    evaluate, plan, and build additional transmission infrastructure
    in the NIETCs. In addition, in



November 2006, FERC issued a final rule promulgating the
    requirements and procedures for invoking FERC’s new
    “backstop” authority to issue permits to construct or
    modify electric transmission facilities in the NIETCs under
    certain circumstances. However, both DOE’s NIETC
    designations and FERC’s final rule regarding permitting
    have been challenged and are currently subject to federal court
    and administrative proceedings. Accordingly, the long-term
    effect of DOE’s NIETC designations and the transmission
    siting rules will depend on the results of those challenges.

Increased opportunities in Fiber to the Premises, or FTTP,
    and Fiber to the Node, or FTTN.

We believe that
    several of the large telecommunications companies are increasing
    their spending, particularly for FTTP and FTTN initiatives.
    Initiatives for this

last-mile

fiber build-out have been announced by Verizon and AT&T as
    well as municipalities throughout the United States. Verizon has
    indicated that it expects to pass 18 million premises with
    its fiber network by the end of 2010. This equates to more than
    50% of the households in Verizon’s 28-state area.

AT&T has also announced plans to offer internet telephone
    service to 18 million homes by the middle of 2008,
    including the installation of more than 38,000 miles of
    fiber at an estimated cost of $4 billion. At the end of
    2006, AT&T had launched its U-verse suite of services,
    which includes internet protocol (IP) based television,
    high-speed internet access and voice services. At the end of
    2007, AT&T announced a major expansion of its U-verse
    services, with deployment expected to reach approximately
    30 million living units across 22 states by the end of
    2010.

This fiber will deliver integrated

IP-based

television, high-speed internet and IP voice and wireless
    bundles of products and services. More than two million
    North American households have direct connections into
    high-speed fiber networks. The rate of growth in fiber to the
    home connections continues to increase as more Americans look to
    next-generation networks for faster internet and more robust
    video services. As a result of these efforts, we expect an
    increase in demand for our telecommunications and underground
    construction services over the next few years. While not all of
    this spending will be for services that we provide, we believe
    that we are well-positioned to furnish infrastructure solutions
    for these initiatives throughout the United States.

Increased outsourcing of network infrastructure installation
    and maintenance.

We believe that electric power,
    gas, telecommunications and cable television providers are
    increasingly focusing on their core competencies, resulting in
    an increase in the outsourcing of network services. Total
    employment in the electric utility industry declined
    dramatically in the last decade, reflecting, in part, the
    outsourcing trend by utilities. We believe that by outsourcing
    network services to third-party service providers such as us,
    our customers can reduce costs, provide flexibility in budgets
    and improve service and performance.

One of the largest issues facing utilities is the aging of the
    workforce. NERC estimates that approximately one in three
    utility workers will be 50 or older by 2010, yet there will be a
    25 percent increase in demand by 2015. Many utilities look
    to a third-party partner to help address this issue. With more
    than 15,000 employees across the nation, we believe we are
    well-positioned to provide skilled labor to supplement or
    completely outsource a utility’s workforce. As a specialty
    contractor with nationwide scope, we are able to leverage our
    existing labor force and equipment infrastructure across
    multiple customers and projects, resulting in better utilization
    of labor and assets.

Increased capital expenditures resulting from our
    customers’ improved financial position.

The
    economic health of the industries we serve continues to improve
    after the downturn that a number of companies, including many of
    our customers, suffered in past years. As a result, we believe
    that both capital spending and maintenance budgets have
    stabilized and will increase in certain key end markets. We
    believe, however, that it is possible that a prolonged recession
    could have a negative impact on our customers’ spending
    patterns.

Increased demand calls for new generation
    sources.

Industry resources estimate that almost
    50 percent of North American power generation currently
    relies on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.
    Concerns about fuel diversification and greenhouse gas emissions
    are driving an increased focus on the development of renewable
    power sources such as wind, solar and hydro electric. Under
    current mandates in 25 states, clean energy must comprise
    up to 30 percent of a utility’s energy portfolio
    within the next five to fifteen years. In



2003, just ten states had such requirements. In a recent report
    published by an industry research firm, it is predicted that the
    U.S. wind power generation market alone will exceed 50
    gigawatts of capacity by 2015 and will require capital
    expenditures ranging from $184 billion to $356 billion
    between 2007 and 2025. Due to the often remote location of
    renewable sources of energy, significant transmission
    infrastructure will be required. As renewable power resources
    will only fulfill a portion of the increased demand in the
    future, we also expect a continuation of new power generation
    based on traditional resources such as natural gas. We
    anticipate that the development of renewable power sources,
    together with other power generation facilities to be built,
    will result in an increase in demand for transmission and
    substation engineering and installation services.

Strengths

Geographic reach and significant size and
    scale.

As a result of our nationwide operations
    and significant scale, we are able to deploy services to
    customers across the United States. This capability is
    particularly important to our customers who operate networks
    that span multiple states or regions. The scale of our
    operations also allows us to mobilize significant numbers of
    employees on short notice for emergency restoration services.

Strong financial profile.

Our strong liquidity
    position provides us with the flexibility to capitalize on new
    business and growth opportunities. As of December 31, 2007,
    we had cash and cash equivalents of $407.1 million, working
    capital of $547.3 million and long-term debt of
    $143.8 million. We also have a $475 million credit
    facility under which we have available borrowing capacity of
    $306.4 million as of December 31, 2007.

Strong and diverse customer relationships.

Our
    customer relationships extend over multiple end markets, and
    include electric power, gas, telecommunications and cable
    television companies, as well as commercial, industrial and
    governmental entities. We have established a solid base of
    long-standing customer relationships by providing high quality
    service in a cost-efficient and timely manner. We enjoy
    multi-year relationships with many of our customers. In some
    cases, these relationships are decades old. We derive a
    significant portion of our revenues from strategic alliances or
    long-term maintenance agreements with our customers, which we
    believe offer opportunities for future growth. For example,
    certain of our strategic alliances contain an exclusivity clause
    or a right of first refusal for a certain type of work or work
    in a certain geographic region.

Proprietary technology.

Our electric power
    customers benefit from our ability to perform services without
    interrupting power service to their customers, which we refer to
    as energized services. We hold a U.S. patent for the
    exclusive use through 2014 of the
    LineMaster

tm

robotic arm, which enhances our ability to deliver these
    energized services to our customers. We believe that delivery of
    energized services is a significant factor in differentiating us
    from our competition and winning new business. Our energized
    services workforce is specially trained to deliver these
    services and operate the
    LineMaster

tm

robotic arm.

Delivery of comprehensive

end-to-end

solutions.

We believe that electric power, gas,
    telecommunications and cable television companies will continue
    to seek service providers who can design, install and maintain
    their networks on a quick and reliable, yet cost effective
    basis. We are one of the few network service providers capable
    of regularly delivering

end-to-end

solutions on a nationwide basis. As companies in the electric
    power, gas, telecommunications and cable television industries
    continue to search for service providers who can effectively
    design, install and maintain their networks, we believe that our
    service, industry and geographical breadth place us in a strong
    position to meet these needs.

Experienced management team.

Our executive
    management team has an average of 30 years of experience
    within the contracting industry, and our operating unit
    executives’ average over 27 years of experience in
    their respective industries.

Strategy

The key elements of our business strategy are:

Capitalize on favorable trends in certain key end
    markets.

We believe that we are well-positioned
    to capitalize on increased capital spending by customers across
    certain key end markets. Our strong and diverse



customer relationships and geographic reach should allow us to
    benefit from investments by, among others, electric power
    customers in transmission and distribution infrastructure and by
    large telecommunications companies in FTTP and FTTN initiatives.

Leverage existing customer relationships and expand services
    to drive growth.

We believe we can improve our
    rate of growth by expanding the portfolio of services and
    solutions we can provide to our existing and potential customer
    base. Expanding our portfolio of services allows us to develop,
    build and maintain networks on a regional, national and
    international scale and adapt to our customers’ changing
    needs. We believe that increasing our geographic and
    technological capabilities, together with promoting best
    practices and cross-selling our services to our customers,
    positions us well for the current end market environment.

Focus on expanding operating efficiencies.

We
    intend to continue to:

•

focus on growth in our more profitable services and on projects
    that have higher margins;

•

combine overlapping operations of certain operating units;

•

share pricing, bidding, technology, equipment and best practices
    among our operating units;

•

adjust our costs to match the level of demand for our
    services; and

•

develop and expand the use of management information systems.

Expand our dark fiber network.

We intend to
    continue to expand our dark fiber network which was acquired as
    part of the InfraSource acquisition. Approximately
    $85 million of our capital spending for 2008 is targeted
    for the expansion of our dark fiber network in connection with
    committed leasing arrangements with customers, with another
    $75 million estimated to be expended in 2009. The dark
    fiber leasing business consists primarily of leasing

point-to-point

telecommunications infrastructure in select markets to
    communication services providers, large industrial and financial
    services customers, school districts and other entities with
    high bandwidth telecommunication needs.

Pursue strategic acquisitions.

We continue to
    evaluate potential acquisitions of companies with strong
    management teams and good reputations to broaden our customer
    base, expand our geographic area of operation and grow our
    portfolio of services. During 2007 and from 1998 through 2000,
    we grew significantly through acquisitions. We believe that
    attractive acquisition candidates still exist as a result of the
    highly fragmented nature of the industry, the inability of many
    companies to expand and modernize due to capital constraints and
    the desire of owners of acquisition candidates for liquidity. We
    also believe that our financial strength, strong equity market
    position and experienced management team will be attractive to
    acquisition candidates.

Pursue new business opportunities.

We
    continuously leverage our core expertise and pursue new business
    opportunities, including opportunities with renewable energy
    projects and in the government and international arenas. In
    connection with renewable energy projects, we have the
    capabilities to install the facilities as well as provide
    connectivity to the grid. We also believe that we are
    well-positioned to participate in power and communications
    infrastructure projects in the United States and overseas
    involving customers in both the public and private sectors.

Financial
    Information about Geographic Areas

We operate primarily in the United States; however, we derived
    $25.7 million, $53.6 million and $71.5 million of
    our revenues from foreign operations, the majority of which was
    earned in Canada, during the years ended December 31, 2005,
    2006 and 2007, respectively. In addition, we held property and
    equipment in the amount of $4.9 million, $6.0 million
    and $9.0 million in foreign countries as of December 31,
    2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

Our business, financial condition and results of operations in
    foreign countries may be adversely impacted by monetary and
    fiscal policies, currency fluctuations, energy shortages,
    regulatory requirements and other political, social and economic
    developments or instability.

Customers,
    Strategic Alliances and Preferred Provider
    Relationships

Our customers include electric power, gas, telecommunications
    and cable television companies, as well as commercial,
    industrial and governmental entities. Our 10 largest customers
    accounted for 30.7% of our consolidated revenues during the year
    ended December 31, 2007. Our largest customer accounted for
    approximately 5.1% of our consolidated revenues for the year
    ended December 31, 2007.

Although we have a centralized marketing strategy, management at
    each of our operating units is responsible for developing and
    maintaining successful long-term relationships with customers.
    Our operating unit management teams build upon existing customer
    relationships to secure additional projects and increase revenue
    from our current customer base. Many of these customer
    relationships originated decades ago and are maintained through
    a partnering approach to account management that includes
    project evaluation and consulting, quality performance,
    performance measurement and direct customer contact. On an
    operating unit level, management maintains a parallel focus on
    pursuing growth opportunities with prospective customers. We
    continue to encourage operating unit management to cross-sell
    services of other operating units to their customers. In
    addition, our business development group promotes and markets
    our services for prospective large national accounts and
    projects that would require services from multiple operating
    units.

We strive to maintain our status as a preferred vendor to our
    customers. Many of our customers and prospective customers
    maintain a list of preferred vendors with whom the customer
    enters into a formal contractual agreement as a result of a

request-for-proposal

process. As a preferred vendor, we have met



minimum standards for a specific category of service, maintain a
    high level of performance and agree to certain payment terms and
    negotiated rates.

We believe that our strategic relationships with large providers
    of electric power and telecommunications services will offer
    opportunities for future growth. Many of these strategic
    relationships take the form of a strategic alliance or long-term
    maintenance agreement. Strategic alliance agreements generally
    state an intention to work together and many provide us with
    preferential bidding procedures. Strategic alliances and
    long-term maintenance agreements are typically agreements for an
    initial term of approximately two to four years that may include
    an option to add extensions at the end of the initial term.
    Certain of our strategic alliance and long-term maintenance
    agreements are “evergreen” contracts with exclusivity
    clauses providing that we will be awarded all contracts, or a
    right of first refusal, for a certain type of work or work in a
    certain geographic region.

Backlog

Backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to
    realize from work to be performed in the future on uncompleted
    contracts, including new contractual agreements on which work
    has not begun. Our backlog at December 31, 2005 and 2006
    was approximately $1.30 billion and $1.48 billion
    based only on work expected to be performed over the next twelve
    months. At that time, we did not include estimated revenues
    beyond twelve months in our calculations. Our total backlog at
    December 31, 2007 was approximately $4.67 billion, of
    which $2.36 billion is expected to be performed over the
    next twelve months.

The backlog estimates above include amounts under long-term
    maintenance contracts in addition to construction contracts. We
    determine the amount of work under long-term maintenance
    contracts, or master service agreements (MSAs), to be disclosed
    as backlog as the estimate of future work to be performed based
    upon recurring historical trends inherent in the current MSAs,
    factoring in seasonal demand and projected customer needs based
    upon ongoing communications with the customer. In many
    instances, our customers are not contractually committed to
    specific volumes of services under our MSAs, and many of our
    contracts may be terminated with notice. There can be no
    assurance as to our customer’s requirements or that our
    estimates are accurate. In addition, many of our MSAs, as well
    as contracts for dark fiber leasing, are subject to renewal
    options. For purposes of calculating backlog, we have included
    future renewal options only to the extent the renewals can
    reasonably be expected to occur.

Competition

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We
    compete with other contractors in most of the geographic markets
    in which we operate, and several of our competitors are large
    domestic companies that have significant financial, technical
    and marketing resources. In addition, there are relatively few
    barriers to entry into some of the industries in which we
    operate and, as a result, any organization that has adequate
    financial resources and access to technical expertise may become
    a competitor. A significant portion of our revenues is currently
    derived from unit price or fixed price agreements, and price is
    often an important factor in the award of such agreements.
    Accordingly, we could be underbid by our competitors in an
    effort by them to procure such business. We believe that as
    demand for our services increases, customers will increasingly
    consider other factors in choosing a service provider, including
    technical expertise and experience, financial and operational
    resources, nationwide presence, industry reputation and
    dependability, which we expect to benefit contractors such as
    us. There can be no assurance, however, that our competitors
    will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to
    provide services that are superior in both price and quality to
    our services, or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our
    competitive position. We may also face competition from the
    in-house service organizations of our existing or prospective
    customers, including electric power, gas, telecommunications,
    cable television and engineering companies, which employ
    personnel who perform some of the same types of services a those
    provided by us. Although a significant portion of these services
    is currently outsourced by our customers, there can be no
    assurance that our existing or prospective customers will
    continue to outsource services in the future.



Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we had 1,954 salaried employees,
    including executive officers, project managers and engineers,
    job superintendents, staff and clerical personnel, and
    13,307 hourly employees, the number of which fluctuates
    depending upon the number and size of the projects we undertake
    at any particular time. Approximately 50% of our hourly
    employees at December 31, 2007 were covered by collective
    bargaining agreements with certain of our subsidiaries,
    primarily with the International Brotherhood of Electrical
    Workers (IBEW). These collective bargaining agreements require
    the payment of specified wages to our union employees, the
    observance of certain workplace rules and the payment of certain
    amounts to multi-employer pension plans and employee benefit
    trusts rather than administering the funds on behalf of these
    employees. These collective bargaining agreements have varying
    terms and expiration dates. The majority of the collective
    bargaining agreements contain provisions that prohibit work
    stoppages or strikes, even during specified negotiation periods
    relating to agreement renewal, and provide for binding
    arbitration dispute resolution in the event of prolonged
    disagreement.

We provide a health, welfare and benefit plan for employees who
    are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have a
    401(k) plan pursuant to which eligible employees who are not
    provided retirement benefits through a collective bargaining
    agreement may make contributions through a payroll deduction. We
    make matching cash contributions of 100% of each employee’s
    contribution up to 3% of that employee’s salary and 50% of
    each employee’s contribution between 3% and 6% of such
    employee’s salary, up to the maximum amount permitted by
    law.

Our industry is experiencing a shortage of journeyman linemen in
    certain geographic areas. In response to the shortage, we seek
    to take advantage of various IBEW and National Electrical
    Contractors Association (NECA) training programs and support the
    joint IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program which trains qualified
    electrical workers. We have also established apprenticeship
    training programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor
    for employees not subject to the IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship
    Program, as well as additional company-wide and project-specific
    employee training and educational programs.

We believe our relationships with our employees and union
    representatives are good.

Materials

Our customers typically supply most or all of the materials
    required for each job. However, for some of our contracts, we
    may procure all or part of the materials required. We purchase
    such materials from a variety of sources and do not anticipate
    experiencing any difficulties in procuring such materials.

Training,
    Quality Assurance and Safety

Performance of our services requires the use of equipment and
    exposure to conditions that can be dangerous. Although we are
    committed to a policy of operating safely and prudently, we have
    been and will continue to be subject to claims by employees,
    customers and third parties for property damage and personal
    injuries resulting from performance of our services. Our
    policies require that employees complete the prescribed training
    and service program of the operating unit for which they work in
    addition to those required, if applicable, by the IBEW/NECA
    Apprenticeship Program prior to performing more sophisticated
    and technical jobs. For example, all journeyman linemen are
    required by the IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program to complete a
    minimum of 7,000 hours of

on-the-job

training, approximately 200 hours of classroom education
    and extensive testing and certification. Certain of our
    operating units have established apprenticeship training
    programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor that
    prescribe training requirements for employees who are not
    otherwise subject to the requirements of the IBEW/NECA
    Apprenticeship Program. Also, each operating unit requires
    additional training, depending upon the sophistication and
    technical requirements of each particular job. We have
    established company-wide training and educational programs, as
    well as comprehensive safety policies and regulations, by
    sharing best practices throughout our operations.



Regulation

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and
    international laws and regulations including:

•

licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to
    electricians and engineers;

•

building and electrical codes;

•

permitting and inspection requirements applicable to
    construction projects;

•

regulations relating to worker safety and environmental
    protection; and

•

special bidding, procurement and other requirements on
    government projects.

We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our
    operations and that we are in substantial compliance with
    applicable regulatory requirements. Our failure to comply with
    applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or
    revocation of our operating licenses.

Environmental
    Matters

We are committed to the protection of the environment and train
    our employees to perform their duties accordingly. We are
    subject to numerous federal, state, local and international
    environmental laws and regulations governing our operations,
    including the handling, transportation and disposal of
    non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as
    emissions and discharges into the environment, including
    discharges to air, surface water and groundwater and soil. We
    also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability
    and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances
    into the environment. Under certain of these laws and
    regulations, such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of
    previously owned or operated properties, or properties to which
    hazardous substances or wastes were sent by current or former
    operations at our facilities, regardless of whether we directly
    caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of
    discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such
    substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or
    adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or use our
    properties as collateral for financing. In addition, we could be
    held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain
    environmental laws and regulations and also could be subject to
    a revocation of our licenses or permits, which could materially
    and adversely affect our business and results of operations.

From time to time, we may incur costs and obligations for
    correcting environmental noncompliance matters and for
    remediation at or relating to certain of our properties. We
    believe we have complied with, and are currently complying with
    our environmental obligations to date and that such obligations
    will not have a material adverse effect on our business or
    financial performance.

Risk
    Management and Insurance

As of December 31, 2007, we were insured for
    employer’s liability and general liability claims, subject
    to a deductible of $1.0 million per occurrence, and for
    auto liability subject to a deductible of $3.0 million per
    occurrence. We were also insured for workers’ compensation
    claims, subject to a deductible of $2.0 million per
    occurrence. Additionally, we were subject to an annual
    cumulative aggregate liability of up to $1.0 million on
    workers’ compensation claims in excess of $2.0 million
    per occurrence. We also had an employee health care benefits
    plan for employees not subject to collective bargaining
    agreements, which was  subject to a deductible of $250,000 per
    claimant per year until December 31, 2007. The deductible
    for employee health care benefits was increased to $350,000 per
    claimant per year beginning January 1, 2008.

Effective upon the Merger, InfraSource became insured under
    Quanta’s property and casualty insurance program.
    Previously, InfraSource was insured for workers’
    compensation, general liability and employer’s liability,
    each subject to a deductible of $0.75 million per
    occurrence. InfraSource was also insured for auto liability,
    subject to a deductible of $0.5 million per occurrence.
    InfraSource continued to operate its own health plan for
    employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements
    through December 31, 2007, which was subject to a
    deductible of $150,000 per claimant per year.



Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported
    and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
    assistance from third-party actuaries. The accruals are based
    upon known facts and historical trends, and management believes
    such accruals to be adequate. As of December 31, 2006 and
    December 31, 2007, the gross amount accrued for
    self-insurance claims totaled $117.2 million and
    $152.0 million, with $73.4 million and
    $110.1 million considered to be long-term and included in
    other non-current liabilities. Related insurance
    recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2006 and
    December 31, 2007 were $10.7 million and
    $22.1 million, of which $5.0 million and
    $11.9 million are included in prepaid expenses and other
    current assets and $5.7 million and $10.2 million are
    included in other assets, net.

Our casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods from
    August 1, 2000 to February 28, 2003 is experiencing
    financial distress but is currently paying valid claims. In the
    event that this insurer’s financial situation deteriorates,
    we may be required to pay certain obligations that otherwise
    would have been paid by this insurer. We estimate that the total
    future claim amount that this insurer is currently obligated to
    pay on our behalf for the above-mentioned policy periods is
    approximately $4.5 million, and we have recorded a
    receivable and corresponding liability for such amount as of
    December 31, 2007. However, our estimate of the potential
    range of these future claim amounts is between $2.1 million
    and $7.8 million. The actual amounts ultimately paid by us
    related to these claims, if any, may vary materially from the
    above range and could be impacted by further claims development
    and the extent to which the insurer could not honor its
    obligations. We continue to monitor the financial situation of
    this insurer and analyze any alternative actions that could be
    pursued. In any event, we do not expect any failure by this
    insurer to honor its obligations to us, or any alternative
    actions we may pursue, to have a material adverse impact on our
    financial condition; however, the impact could be material to
    our results of operations or cash flows in a given period.

Seasonality
    and Cyclicality

Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to
    seasonal variations. These variations are influenced by weather,
    customer spending patterns, bidding seasons and holidays.
    Typically, our revenues are lowest in the first quarter of the
    year because cold, snowy or wet conditions cause delays. The
    second quarter is typically better than the first, as some
    projects begin, but continued cold and wet weather can often
    impact second quarter productivity. The third quarter is
    typically the best of the year, as a greater number of projects
    are underway and weather is more accommodating to work on
    projects. Revenues during the fourth quarter of the year are
    typically lower than the third quarter but higher than the
    second quarter. Many projects are completed in the fourth
    quarter and revenues often are impacted positively by customers
    seeking to spend their capital budget before the end of the
    year; however, the holiday season and inclement weather
    sometimes can cause delays and thereby reduce revenues and
    increase costs.

Working capital needs are generally higher during the spring and
    summer seasons due to increased work activity. Conversely,
    working capital needs are typically lower during the winter
    months when work is usually slower due to winter weather.

Our industry can be highly cyclical. As a result, our volume of
    business may be adversely affected by declines in new projects
    in various geographic regions in the United States. Project
    schedules, in particular in connection with larger, longer-term
    projects, can also create fluctuations in the services provided
    under projects, which may adversely affect us in a given
    quarter. The financial condition of our customers and their
    access to capital, variations in the margins of projects
    performed during any particular quarter, regional economic
    conditions, timing of acquisitions and the timing and magnitude
    of acquisition assimilation costs may also materially affect our
    quarterly results. Accordingly, our operating results in any
    particular quarter or year may not be indicative of the results
    that can be expected for any other quarter or year.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties,
    including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties
    described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are
    not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not known to us or not described below also may
    impair our business operations. If any of the following risks
    actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of
    operations could be harmed and we may not be able to achieve our
    goals. This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

also includes statements reflecting assumptions, expectations,
    projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are
    intended as “forward-looking statements” under the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be
    read in conjunction with the section entitled

“Uncertainty of Forward-Looking Statements and
    Information”

included in Item 7
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.”

Our
    operating results may vary significantly from quarter to
    quarter.

We typically experience lower gross and operating margins during
    winter months due to lower demand for our services and more
    difficult operating conditions. Additionally, our quarterly
    results may be materially and adversely affected by:

•

variations in the margins of projects performed during any
    particular quarter;

•

a change in the demand for our services caused by severe weather
    conditions;

•

increases in construction and design costs;

•

the timing and volume of work under contract;

•

regional or general economic conditions;

•

the budgetary spending patterns of customers;

•

the termination of existing agreements;

•

losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by
    insurance;

•

a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;

•

payment risk associated with the financial condition of our
    customers;

•

changes in bonding and lien requirements applicable to existing
    and new agreements;

•

costs we incur to support growth internally or through
    acquisitions or otherwise;



•

the timing and integration of acquisitions; and

•

the timing and magnitude of acquisition integration costs and
    potential goodwill impairments.

Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may
    not be indicative of the results that you can expect for any
    other quarter or for the entire year.

We
    incurred substantial transaction and Merger-related costs in
    connection with the Merger and we may not realize all of the
    anticipated synergies and other benefits from acquiring
    InfraSource.

We have incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of
    non-recurring transaction and Merger-related costs associated
    with completing the Merger with InfraSource, combining the
    operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies.
    These fees and costs may be significant. Additional
    unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the
    businesses of Quanta and InfraSource. Although we expect that
    the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization
    of other efficiencies, related to the integration of the two
    businesses will offset the incremental transaction and
    Merger-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be
    achieved in the near term, or at all.

The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on our ability
    to realize the synergies and other benefits from acquiring
    InfraSource. To realize these synergies and benefits, however,
    we must successfully integrate the operations and personnel of
    InfraSource into our business. We have made substantial progress
    toward the integration of the two companies, but if this
    integration is unsuccessful, the anticipated benefits of the
    Merger may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer or
    cost more to realize than expected. Because we and InfraSource
    have previously operated as independent companies, it is
    possible that integration will result in the future loss of
    valuable employees, the disruption of our business or
    inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices,
    policies and compensation arrangements. The size of the Merger
    may also make integration difficult, expensive and disruptive,
    adversely affecting our revenues and earnings.

As a
    result of the Merger with InfraSource, we are subject to
    additional risks.

As a result of the Merger, our results of operations could be
    adversely affected by any issues attributable to
    InfraSource’s operations that arose prior to the closing of
    the Merger, including issues with respect to InfraSource
    projects that may decrease our profitability or result in
    litigation. Furthermore, to the extent that InfraSource had or
    is perceived by customers to have had operational challenges,
    such as on-time performance, safety issues or workforce issues,
    those challenges may raise concerns by our customers, which may
    limit or impede our future ability to obtain additional work
    from those customers.

Quanta and InfraSource also had some customer overlap prior to
    the Merger. If any of these customers in common decrease their
    amount of business with us to reduce their reliance on a single
    company, such decrease in business could adversely impact our
    sales and profitability.

InfraSource, certain of its officers and directors and various
    other parties, including David R. Helwig, the former chief
    executive officer of InfraSource, who became a director of
    Quanta after completion of the Merger, are defendants in a
    lawsuit seeking unspecified damages filed in the State District
    Court in Harris County, Texas. The plaintiffs allege that the
    defendants violated their fiduciary duties and committed
    constructive fraud by failing to maximize shareholder value in
    connection with certain acquisitions by InfraSource Incorporated
    that closed in 1999 and 2000 and the acquisition of InfraSource
    Incorporated by InfraSource in 2003 and committed other acts of
    misconduct following the filing of the petition. The parties
    agreed to settle this lawsuit in January 2008 and agreed to a
    dismissal of all material claims, although the dismissal has not
    yet been ordered by the court.

An
    economic downturn may lead to less demand for our
    services.

Because the vast majority of our revenue is derived from a few
    industries, a downturn in any of those industries would
    adversely affect our results of operations. The
    telecommunications and utility markets experienced substantial
    change during 2002 and 2003 as evidenced by an increased number
    of bankruptcies in the telecommunications market, continued
    devaluation of many of our customers’ debt and equity
    securities and pricing pressures resulting from challenges faced
    by major industry participants. These factors contributed



to the delay and cancellation of projects and reduction of
    capital spending, which impacted our operations and our ability
    to grow at historical levels. A number of other factors,
    including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the
    industries we serve or a prolonged economic recession, could
    adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness
    to fund capital expenditures in the future or pay for past
    services. Additionally, our gas distribution installation
    business is driven in part by the housing construction market,
    and continued declines in new housing construction could cause
    reductions in our gas distribution installation business.
    Consolidation, competition or capital constraints in the
    electric power, gas, telecommunications or cable television
    industries may also result in reduced spending by, or the loss
    of, one or more of our customers.

Project
    delays or cancellations may result in additional costs to us,
    reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated
    damages.

In certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion by a
    scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance
    and performance testing levels. Failure to meet any of those
    schedules or performance requirements could result in additional
    costs or penalties, including liquidated damages, and such
    amounts could exceed expected project profit. Many projects
    involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction
    phases that may occur over extended time periods, sometimes up
    to two years. We may encounter difficulties in engineering,
    delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a
    third party, equipment and material delivery, schedule changes,
    weather-related delays and other factors, some of which are
    beyond our control, that impact our ability to complete the
    project in accordance with the original delivery schedule. For
    example, the recent increase in demand for transmission services
    has strained production resources, creating significant lead
    times for obtaining large transformers, transmission towers and
    poles. As a result, electric transmission project revenues could
    be significantly reduced or delayed due to the difficulty we or
    our customers may experience in obtaining required materials. In
    addition, we occasionally contract with third-party
    subcontractors to assist us with the completion of contracts.
    Any delay by suppliers or by subcontractors in the completion of
    their portion of the project, or any failure by a subcontractor
    to satisfactorily complete its portion of the project may result
    in delays in the overall progress of the project or may cause us
    to incur additional costs, or both. We also may encounter
    project delays due to local opposition, which may include
    injunctive actions as well as public protests, to the siting of
    transmission lines or other facilities.

Delays and additional costs may be substantial and, in some
    cases, we may be required to compensate the customer for such
    delays. We may not be able to recover all of such costs. In
    extreme cases, the above-mentioned factors could cause project
    cancellations, and we may not be able to replace such projects
    with similar projects or at all. Such delays or cancellations
    may impact our reputation or relationships with customers,
    adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts.

Project contracts may require customers or other parties to
    provide design, engineering information, equipment or materials
    to be used on a project. In some cases, the project schedule or
    the design, engineering information, equipment or materials may
    be deficient or delivered later than required by the project
    schedule. Our customers may change various elements of the
    project after its commencement. Under these circumstances, we
    generally negotiate with the customer with respect to the amount
    of additional time required and the compensation to be paid to
    us. We are subject to the risk that we may be unable to obtain,
    through negotiation, arbitration, litigation or otherwise,
    adequate amounts to compensate us for the additional work or
    expenses incurred by us due to customer-requested change orders
    or failure by the customer to timely deliver items, such as
    engineering drawings or materials, required to be provided by
    the customer. A failure to obtain adequate compensation for
    these matters could require us to record a reduction to amounts
    of revenue and gross profit recognized in prior periods under
    the

percentage-of-completion

accounting method. Any such adjustments could be substantial.

Our
    dependence upon fixed price contracts could adversely affect our
    business.

We currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a
    portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. We must
    estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for
    fixed price contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials,
    however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated. These
    variations,



along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price
    contracts, may cause actual revenue and gross profits for a
    project to differ from those we originally estimated and could
    result in reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending
    upon the size of a particular project, variations from the
    estimated contract costs could have a significant impact on our
    operating results for any fiscal quarter or year.

Our
    use of

percentage-of-completion

accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of
    previously reported profits.

As discussed in Item 7

“Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Critical Accounting Policies”

and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements
    included in Item 8 hereof, a significant portion of our
    revenues are recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting, utilizing the

cost-to-cost

method. This method is used because management considers
    expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on
    these contracts. This accounting method is generally accepted
    for fixed price contracts. The

percentage-of-completion

accounting practice we use results in our recognizing contract
    revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in
    proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or
    losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates
    of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses
    are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit
    estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract
    profitability. Further, a substantial portion of our contracts
    contain various cost and performance incentives. Penalties are
    recorded when known or finalized, which generally occurs during
    the latter stages of the contract. In addition, we record cost
    recovery claims when we believe recovery is probable and the
    amounts can be reasonably estimated. Actual collection of claims
    could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a
    reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In
    certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments
    could be significant.

We may
    be unsuccessful at generating internal growth.

Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by,
    among other factors, our ability to:

•

expand the range of services we offer to customers to address
    their evolving network needs;

•

attract new customers;

•

increase the number of projects performed for existing customers;

•

hire and retain qualified employees; and

•

expand geographically, including internationally.

In addition, our customers may delay or reduce the number or
    size of projects available to us due to their inability to
    obtain capital or pay for services provided. Many of the factors
    affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond
    our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will
    be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow
    sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal
    growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve
    internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.

Our
    industry is highly competitive.

Our industry is served by numerous small, owner-operated private
    companies, a few public companies and several large regional
    companies. In addition, relatively few barriers prevent entry
    into some of our industries. As a result, any organization that
    has adequate financial resources and access to technical
    expertise may become one of our competitors. Competition in the
    industry depends on a number of factors, including price.
    Certain of our competitors may have lower overhead cost
    structures and, therefore, may be able to provide their services
    at lower rates than we are able to provide. In addition, some of
    our competitors have significant resources including financial,
    technical and marketing resources. We cannot be certain that our
    competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and
    resources to provide services that are superior in both price
    and quality to our services. Similarly, we cannot be certain
    that we will be able to maintain or



enhance our competitive position within our industry or maintain
    our customer base at current levels. We also may face
    competition from the in-house service organizations of our
    existing or prospective customers. Electric power, gas,
    telecommunications and cable television service providers
    usually employ personnel who perform some of the same types of
    services we do. We cannot be certain that our existing or
    prospective customers will continue to outsource services in the
    future.

The
    Energy Policy Act of 2005 may fail to result in increased
    spending on the electric power transmission
    infrastructure.

Implementation of the Energy Act is still subject to
    considerable fiscal and regulatory uncertainty. Regulations
    implementing the components of the Energy Act that may affect
    demand for our services have only recently been finalized and in
    some cases remain subject to challenge before the Department of
    Energy and in the federal courts. Accordingly, the effect of
    these regulations, once finally implemented, is uncertain. As a
    result, the legislation may not result in increased spending on
    the electric power transmission infrastructure. Continued
    uncertainty regarding the implementation of the Energy Act may
    result in slower growth in demand for our services.

Our
    business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and
    retain qualified employees.

Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will
    be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled
    personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We cannot be
    certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled
    labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our
    growth strategy. For instance, we may experience shortages of
    qualified journeyman linemen. In addition, we cannot be certain
    that our labor expenses will not increase as a result of a
    shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel. Labor
    shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to
    maintain our business or grow our revenues.

Our
    business growth could outpace the capability of our corporate
    management infrastructure.

We cannot be certain that our infrastructure will be adequate to
    support our operations as they expand. Future growth also could
    impose significant additional responsibilities on members of our
    senior management, including the need to recruit and integrate
    new senior level managers and executives. We cannot be certain
    that we will be able to recruit and retain such additional
    managers and executives. To the extent that we are unable to
    manage our growth effectively, or are unable to attract and
    retain additional qualified management, we may not be able to
    expand our operations or execute our business plan.

Factors
    beyond our control may affect our ability to successfully
    execute our acquisition strategy, which may have an adverse
    impact on our growth strategy.

Our business strategy includes expanding our presence in the
    industries we serve through strategic acquisitions of companies
    that complement or enhance our business. We expect to face
    competition for acquisition opportunities, and some of our
    competitors may have access to financing on more favorable terms
    than us or have greater financial resources. This competition
    may limit our acquisition opportunities and our ability to grow
    through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions
    and make them less accretive or possibly non-accretive to us.
    Acquisitions that we may pursue may also involve significant
    cash expenditures, debt incurrence or the issuance of
    securities. Any acquisition may ultimately have a negative
    impact on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

We may
    be unsuccessful at integrating companies that either we have
    acquired or that we may acquire in the future.

As a part of our business strategy, we have acquired, and seek
    to acquire in the future, companies that complement or enhance
    our business. However, we cannot be sure that we will be able to
    successfully integrate each of these companies with our existing
    operations without substantial costs, delays or other
    operational or financial problems. If we do not implement proper
    overall business controls, our decentralized



operating strategy could result in inconsistent operating and
    financial practices at the companies we acquire and our overall
    profitability could be adversely affected. Integrating our
    acquired companies involves a number of special risks which
    could have a negative impact on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations, including:

•

failure of acquired companies to achieve the results we expect;

•

diversion of our management’s attention from operational
    and other matters;

•

difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of
    acquired companies;

•

inability to retain key personnel of acquired companies;

•

risks associated with unanticipated events or
    liabilities; and

•

potential disruptions of our business.

If one of our acquired companies suffers customer
    dissatisfaction or performance problems, the reputation of our
    entire company could suffer.

Our
    results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of
    goodwill impairments.

When we acquire a business, we record an asset called
    “goodwill” equal to the excess amount we pay for the
    business, including liabilities assumed, over the fair value of
    the tangible and intangible assets of the business we acquire.
    For example, in connection with the Merger, we recorded
    approximately $989.8 million in goodwill and
    $158.8 million of intangible assets based on the
    application of purchase accounting. Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 provides that goodwill
    and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives
    not be amortized, but instead be tested at least annually for
    impairment, and intangible assets that have finite useful lives
    continue to be amortized over their useful lives.
    SFAS No. 142 provides specific guidance for testing
    goodwill and other

non-amortized

intangible assets for impairment. SFAS No. 142
    requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions
    when allocating goodwill to reporting units and determining the
    fair value of reporting unit net assets and liabilities,
    including, among other things, an assessment of market
    conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, cost of
    capital and growth rates, which could significantly impact the
    reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair
    value is determined using a combination of the discounted cash
    flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation
    approaches. Absent any impairment indicators, we perform our
    impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter. As part of
    our 2006 annual test for goodwill impairment, goodwill in the
    amount of $56.8 million was written off as a non-cash
    operating expense associated with a decrease in the expected
    future demand for the services of one of our businesses, which
    has historically served the cable television industry. Any
    future impairments, including impairments of the goodwill or
    intangible assets recorded in connection with the Merger, would
    negatively impact our results of operations for the period in
    which the impairment is recognized.

Our
    financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that
    may differ from actual results.

In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States, several estimates and assumptions are used by management
    in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented
    and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to
    exist as of the date of the financial statements. These
    estimates and assumptions must be made because certain
    information that is used in the preparation of our financial
    statements is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated
    with a high degree of precision from data available or is not
    capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted
    methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly
    difficult to determine and we must exercise significant
    judgment. Estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful
    lives of property and equipment, fair value assumptions in
    analyzing goodwill and long-lived asset impairments,
    self-insured claims liabilities, forfeiture estimates relating
    to stock-based compensation, revenue recognition under

percentage-of-completion

accounting and provision for income taxes. Actual results for
    all



estimates could differ materially from the estimates and
    assumptions that we use, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
    cash flows.

During
    the ordinary course of our business, we may become subject to
    lawsuits or indemnity claims, which could materially and
    adversely affect our business and results of
    operations.

We have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a
    defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings during
    the ordinary course of our business. These actions may seek,
    among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury,
    workers’ compensation, employment discrimination, breach of
    contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or
    other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition,
    we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the
    services we provide and actions we take under our contracts with
    them, and, in some instances, we may be allocated risk through
    our contract terms for actions by our customers or other third
    parties. Because our services in certain instances may be
    integral to the operation and performance of our customers’
    infrastructure, we may become subject to lawsuits or claims for
    any failure of the systems that we work on, even if our services
    are not the cause of such failures, and we could be subject to
    civil and criminal liabilities to the extent that our services
    contributed to any property damage, personal injury or system
    failure. The outcome of any of these lawsuits, claims or legal
    proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of
    management’s attention to the business. Payments of
    significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely affect
    our reputation, liquidity and results of operations.

We are
    self-insured against potential liabilities.

Although we maintain insurance policies with respect to
    employer’s liability, general liability, automobile and
    workers’ compensation claims, those policies are subject to
    deductibles ranging from $1.0 million to $3.0 million
    per occurrence depending on the insurance policy. We are
    primarily self-insured for all claims that do not exceed the
    amount of the applicable deductible. Additionally, we are
    subject to an annual cumulative aggregate liability of up to
    $1.0 million on workers’ compensation claims in excess
    of $2.0 million per occurrence. We also have an employee
    health care benefits plan for employees not subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, which was subject to a
    deductible of $250,000 per claimant per year until
    December 31, 2007. The deductible for employee health care
    benefits was increased to $350,000 per claimant per year
    effective January 1, 2008.

Effective upon the Merger, InfraSource became insured under
    Quanta’s property and casualty insurance program.
    Previously, InfraSource was insured for workers’
    compensation, general liability and employer’s liability,
    each subject to a deductible of $0.75 million per
    occurrence. InfraSource was also insured for auto liability,
    subject to a deductible of $0.5 million per occurrence.
    InfraSource continued to operate its own health plan for
    employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements
    through December 31, 2007, which was subject to a
    deductible of $150,000 per claimant per year.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported
    and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
    assistance from third-party actuaries. However, insurance
    liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
    factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination
    of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of
    incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety
    program. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical
    trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate. If
    we were to experience insurance claims or costs significantly
    above our estimates, our results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected in a given period.

Our
    casualty insurance carrier for prior periods is experiencing
    financial distress, which may require us to make payments for
    losses that otherwise would be insured.

Our casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods from
    August 1, 2000 to February 28, 2003 is experiencing
    financial distress, but is currently paying valid claims. In the
    event that this insurer’s financial situation deteriorates,
    we may be required to pay certain obligations that otherwise
    would have been paid by



this insurer. We estimate that the total future claim amount
    that this insurer is currently obligated to pay on our behalf
    for the above mentioned policy periods is approximately
    $4.5 million; however, our estimate of the potential range
    of these future claim amounts is between $2.1 million and
    $7.8 million. The actual amounts ultimately paid by us
    related to these claims, if any, may vary materially from the
    above range and could be impacted by further claims development
    and the extent to which the insurer can not honor its
    obligations. In any event, we do not expect any failure by this
    insurer to honor its obligations to us to have a material
    adverse impact on our financial condition; however, the impact
    could be material to our results of operations or cash flow in a
    given period.

We may
    incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impact relating
    to occupational health and safety matters.

Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations
    relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace.
    While we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial
    resources in our occupational health and safety programs, our
    industry involves a high degree of operational risk and there
    can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability
    exposure. Although we have taken what we believe are appropriate
    precautions, we have suffered fatalities in the past and may
    suffer additional fatalities in the future. Claims for damages
    to persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life,
    could result in substantial costs and liabilities. In addition,
    if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over
    time, our customers could cancel our contracts and not award us
    future business.

Our
    profitability and financial operations may be negatively
    affected by changes in, or interpretations of, existing state or
    federal telecommunications regulations or new regulations that
    could adversely affect our dark fiber leasing
    business.

In connection with the Merger, we acquired InfraSource’s
    dark fiber leasing business. Many of the dark fiber customers
    benefit from the Universal Service

“E-rate”

program, which was established by Congress in the 1996
    Telecommunications Act and is administered by the Universal
    Service Administrative Company (the USAC) under the oversight of
    the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Under the

E-rate

program, schools, libraries and certain health-care facilities
    may receive subsidies for certain approved telecommunications
    services, internet access and internal connections. From time to
    time, bills have been introduced in Congress that would
    eliminate or curtail the

E-rate

program. Passage of such actions by the FCC or USAC to further
    limit

E-rate

subsidies could decrease the demand for telecommunications
    infrastructure service by certain customers.

The telecommunications services we provide through our dark
    fiber leasing business are subject to regulation by the FCC, to
    the extent that they are interstate telecommunications services,
    and by state regulatory agencies, when wholly within a
    particular state. To remain eligible to provide services under
    the

E-rate

program, we must maintain telecommunications authorizations in
    every state where we operate. Changes in federal or state
    regulations could reduce the profitability of our dark fiber
    leasing business. We could be subject to fines if the FCC or a
    state regulatory agency were to determine that any of our
    activities or positions are not in compliance with certain
    regulations. If the profitability of our dark fiber leasing
    business were to decline, or if this business were to become
    subject to fines, our profitability and results of operations
    could also be adversely affected.

Our
    dark fiber leasing business is capital intensive and requires a
    substantial investment before returns can be
    realized.

Our dark fiber leasing business requires substantial amounts of
    capital investment to build out new fiber networks. In 2008, our
    proposed capital expenditures for our dark fiber leasing
    business is approximately $85 million, with another
    $75 million estimated to be expended in 2009. Although we
    do not commit capital to new networks until we have a committed
    lease arrangement in place with at least one customer, we may
    not be able to recoup our initial investment in the network if
    that customer defaults on its commitment. Even if the customer
    does not default or we add additional customers to the network,
    we still may not realize a return on the capital investment for
    an extended period of time. Additionally, new or developing
    technologies



could negatively impact our dark fiber leasing business. If any
    of the above events occur, it could result in an impairment of
    our dark fiber network.

Many
    of our contracts may be canceled on short notice or may not be
    renewed upon completion or expiration, and we may be
    unsuccessful in replacing our contracts in such
    events.

We could experience a decrease in our revenue, net income and
    liquidity if any of the following occur:

•

our customers cancel a significant number of contracts or
    contracts having significant value;

•

we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts
    upon re-bid;

•

we complete a significant number of non-recurring projects and
    cannot replace them with similar projects; or

•

we fail to reduce operating and overhead expenses consistent
    with any decrease in our revenue.

Many of our customers may cancel our contracts on short notice,
    typically

30-90 days,

even if we are not in default under the contract. Certain of our
    customers assign work to us on a

project-by-project

basis under master service agreements. Under these agreements,
    our customers often have no obligation to assign a specific
    amount of work to us. Our operations could decline significantly
    if the anticipated volume of work is not assigned to us. Many of
    our contracts, including our master service agreements, are
    opened to public bid at the expiration of their terms. There can
    be no assurance that we will be the successful bidder on our
    existing contracts that come up for re-bid.

Backlog
    may not be realized or may not result in profits.

Backlog is difficult to determine with certainty. Customers
    often have no obligation under our contracts to assign or
    release work to us, and many contracts may be terminated on
    short notice. Reductions in backlog due to cancellation by a
    customer or for other reasons could significantly reduce the
    revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts included
    in backlog. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be
    reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual
    right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog. The
    backlog we obtain in connection with any companies we acquire,
    including InfraSource, may not be as large as we believed or may
    not result in the revenue or profits we expected. In addition,
    projects may remain in backlog for extended periods of time.
    Consequently, we cannot assure you as to our customers’
    requirements or that our estimates are accurate.

We
    extend credit to customers for purchases of our services, and in
    the past we have had, and in the future we may have, difficulty
    collecting receivables from major customers that have filed
    bankruptcy or are otherwise experiencing financial
    difficulties.

We grant credit, generally without collateral, to our customers,
    which include electric power and gas companies,
    telecommunications and cable television system operators,
    governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners
    and managers of commercial and industrial properties located
    primarily in the United States. Consequently, we are subject to
    potential credit risk related to changes in business and
    economic factors throughout the United States. In the past, our
    customers in the telecommunications business have experienced
    significant financial difficulties and in several instances have
    filed for bankruptcy. A number of our utility customers have
    also experienced business challenges in the past. If additional
    major customers file for bankruptcy or continue to experience
    financial difficulties, or if anticipated recoveries relating to
    receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations
    fail to materialize, we could experience reduced cash flows and
    losses in excess of current allowances provided. In addition,
    material changes in any of our customer’s revenues or cash
    flows could affect our ability to collect amounts due from them.



A
    portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety
    bonds. We may be unable to compete for or work on certain
    projects if we are not able to obtain the necessary surety
    bonds.

Current or future market conditions, including losses incurred
    in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate
    bankruptcies, as well as changes in our surety’s assessment
    of our operating and financial risk, could cause our surety
    providers to decline to issue or renew, or substantially reduce
    the amount of, bonds for our work and could increase our bonding
    costs. These actions could be taken on short notice. If our
    surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to
    bonding, our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity
    from other sureties, finding more business that does not require
    bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project
    performance, such as letters of credit or cash. We may be unable
    to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable
    terms, or at all, which could affect our ability to bid for or
    work on future projects requiring financial assurances.

We have also granted security interests in various of our assets
    to collateralize our obligations to the surety. Furthermore,
    under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or
    continue bonds on a

project-by-project

basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the
    posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or
    renewing any bonds. If we were to experience an interruption or
    reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of
    these or any other reasons, we may be unable to compete for or
    work on certain projects that would require bonding.

The
    departure of key personnel could disrupt our
    business.

We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and
    on senior management of our operating units, including the
    businesses we acquire. Although we have entered into employment
    agreements with terms of one to three years with most of our
    executive officers and certain other key employees, we cannot be
    certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for
    any particular period of time. The loss of key personnel, or the
    inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could
    negatively impact our ability to manage our business. We do not
    carry key-person life insurance on any of our employees.

Our
    unionized workforce could adversely affect our operations and
    our ability to complete future acquisitions.

As of December 31, 2007, approximately 50% of our hourly
    employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements.
    Although the majority of these agreements prohibit strikes and
    work stoppages, we cannot be certain that strikes or work
    stoppages will not occur in the future. Strikes or work
    stoppages would adversely impact our relationships with our
    customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease our
    revenue. Additionally, these agreements may require us to
    participate with other companies in multi-employer pension
    plans. To the extent those plans are underfunded, the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the
    Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, may subject
    us to substantial liabilities under those plans if we withdraw
    from them or they are terminated. Furthermore, the Pension
    Protection Act of 2006 added new funding rules generally
    applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer
    plans that are classified as “endangered,”
    “seriously endangered,” or “critical”
    status. For a plan in critical status, additional required
    contributions and benefit reductions apply; however, we are not
    currently aware of any multi-employer plan to which any of our
    subsidiaries contributes being in “critical” status.

Our ability to complete future acquisitions could be adversely
    affected because of our union status for a variety of reasons.
    For instance, our union agreements may be incompatible with the
    union agreements of a business we want to acquire and some
    businesses may not want to become affiliated with a union based
    company. Additionally, we may increase our exposure to
    withdrawal liabilities for underfunded multi-employer pension
    plans to which an acquired company contributes.

We may
    not be successful in continuing to meet the requirements of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has introduced many requirements
    applicable to us regarding corporate governance and financial
    reporting, including the requirements for management to report
    on our internal



controls over financial reporting and for our independent
    registered public accounting firm to express an opinion over the
    operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting. During 2007, we continued actions to ensure our
    ability to comply with these requirements. As of
    December 31, 2007, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective; however, there can be no assurance that
    our internal control over financial reporting will be effective
    in future years. In accordance with SEC guidance, our assessment
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting did not include InfraSource, which will be included in
    future assessments. Failure to maintain effective internal
    controls or the identification of significant internal control
    deficiencies in InfraSource or other acquisitions made during
    2007 or in the future could result in a decrease in the market
    value of our common stock and our other publicly traded
    securities, the reduced ability to obtain financing, the loss of
    customers, penalties and additional expenditures to meet the
    requirements.

Our
    failure to comply with environmental laws could result in
    significant liabilities.

Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and
    regulations, including those dealing with the handling and
    disposal of waste products, PCBs, fuel storage and air quality.
    We perform work in many different types of underground
    environments. If the field location maps supplied to us are not
    accurate, or if objects are present in the soil that are not
    indicated on the field location maps, our underground work could
    strike objects in the soil, some of which may contain
    pollutants. These objects may also rupture, resulting in the
    discharge of pollutants. In such circumstances, we may be liable
    for fines and damages, and we may be unable to obtain
    reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect
    information. In addition, we perform directional drilling
    operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and
    water bodies. Due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and
    water bodies, it is possible that such directional drilling may
    cause a surface fracture, resulting in the release of subsurface
    materials. These subsurface materials may contain contaminants
    in excess of amounts permitted by law, potentially exposing us
    to remediation costs and fines. We also own and lease several
    facilities at which we store our equipment. Some of these
    facilities contain fuel storage tanks which are above or below
    ground. If these tanks were to leak, we could be responsible for
    the cost of remediation as well as potential fines.

In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of
    existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously
    unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new

clean-up

requirements could require us to incur significant costs or
    become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could
    harm our financial condition and results of operations. In
    certain instances, we have obtained indemnification or covenants
    from third parties (including predecessors or lessors) for such
    cleanup and other obligations and liabilities that we believe
    are adequate to cover such obligations and liabilities. However,
    such third-party indemnities or covenants may not cover all of
    our costs, and such unanticipated obligations or liabilities, or
    future obligations and liabilities, may have a material adverse
    effect on our business operations or financial condition.
    Further, we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify
    or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities
    relating to any acquired business.

Risks
    associated with operating in international markets could
    restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business
    and prospects.

While only a small percentage of our revenue is currently
    derived from international markets, we hope to continue to
    expand the volume of services that we provide internationally.
    We presently conduct our international sales efforts in Canada,
    Mexico and selected countries overseas, but expect that the
    number of countries that we operate in could expand
    significantly over the next few years. Economic conditions,
    including those resulting from wars, civil unrest, acts of
    terrorism and other conflicts, may adversely affect the global
    economy, our customers and their ability to pay for our
    services. In addition, there are numerous risks inherent in
    conducting our business internationally, including, but not
    limited to, potential instability in international markets,
    changes in regulatory requirements applicable to international
    operations, currency fluctuations in foreign countries,
    political, economic and social conditions in foreign countries
    and complex U.S. and foreign laws and treaties, including
    tax laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. These
    risks



could restrict our ability to provide services to international
    customers and could adversely affect our ability to operate our
    business profitably.

Opportunities
    within the government arena could lead to increased governmental
    regulation applicable to us and unrecoverable start-up
    costs.

Most government contracts are awarded through a regulated
    competitive bidding process. As we pursue increased
    opportunities in the government arena, management’s focus
    associated with the start up and bidding process may be diverted
    away from other opportunities. If we were to be successful in
    being awarded government contracts, a significant amount of
    costs could be required before any revenues were realized from
    these contracts. In addition, as a government contractor, we
    would be subject to a number of procurement rules and other
    public sector liabilities, any deemed violation of which could
    lead to fines or penalties or a loss of business. Government
    agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors.
    Government agencies may review a contractor’s performance
    under its contracts, cost structure, and compliance with
    applicable laws, regulations and standards. If government
    agencies determine through these audits or reviews that costs
    were improperly allocated to specific contracts, they will not
    reimburse the contractor for those costs or may require the
    contractor to refund previously reimbursed costs. If government
    agencies determine that we engaged in improper activity, we may
    be subject to civil and criminal penalties. In addition, if the
    government were to even allege improper activity, we also could
    experience serious harm to our reputation. Many government
    contracts must be appropriated each year. If appropriations are
    not made in subsequent years we would not realize all of the
    potential revenues from any awarded contracts.

The
    industries we serve are subject to rapid technological and
    structural changes that could reduce the demand for the services
    we provide.

The electric power, gas, telecommunications and cable television
    industries are undergoing rapid change as a result of
    technological advances that could, in certain cases, reduce the
    demand for our services, impair the value of our dark fiber
    network or otherwise negatively impact our business. New or
    developing technologies could displace the wireline systems used
    for voice, video and data transmissions, and improvements in
    existing technology may allow telecommunications and cable
    television companies to significantly improve their networks
    without physically upgrading them.

We may
    not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance
    desired growth and operations.

If we cannot secure additional financing in the future on
    acceptable terms, we may be unable to support our growth
    strategy or future operations. We cannot readily predict the
    ability of certain customers to pay for past services or the
    timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts. Using cash
    for acquisitions limits our financial flexibility and makes us
    more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or
    equity financings. Our existing debt agreements contain
    significant restrictions on our operational and financial
    flexibility, including our ability to incur additional debt or
    conduct equity financings, and if we seek more debt we may have
    to agree to additional covenants that limit our operational and
    financial flexibility. When we seek additional debt or equity
    financings, we cannot be certain that additional debt or equity
    will be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all.
    Furthermore, our credit facility has commitments from several
    banks. With the current turbulent credit markets resulting from,
    among other factors, losses from the sub-prime mortgage crisis,
    banks may become more restrictive in their lending practices or
    unable to fund their commitments, which may limit our access to
    the capital needed to fund our growth and operations.

Our
    convertible subordinated notes are presently convertible or may
    be convertible in the future, which, if converted, may result in
    substantial dilution to existing stockholders, lower prevailing
    market prices for our common stock or cause a significant cash
    outlay.

As a result of our common stock satisfying the market price
    condition of our convertible subordinated notes, our 4.5%
    convertible subordinated notes due 2023 (4.5% Notes) were
    convertible at the option of the holder during each quarter of
    2006 and 2007, and our 3.75% convertible subordinated notes due
    2026 (3.75% Notes) were convertible at the option of the
    holders during the third quarter of 2007. During 2007,



$21,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 4.5% Notes
    were settled in cash upon conversion by the holders. The
    remaining 4.5% Notes are presently convertible at the
    option of each holder, and the conversion period will expire on
    March 31, 2008, but may continue or resume in future
    periods upon the satisfaction of the market price condition or
    other conditions. The 3.75% Notes are not presently
    convertible, but may resume convertibility in future periods
    upon satisfaction of the market price condition or other
    conditions.

At any time on or after October 8, 2008, we may redeem for
    cash some or all of the 4.5% Notes at the principal amount
    thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The holders of the
    4.5% Notes that are called for redemption will have the
    right to convert all or some of their notes.

We have the right to deliver shares of our common stock, cash or
    a combination of cash and shares of our common stock upon a
    conversion of the notes. The number of shares issuable upon
    conversion will be determined based on a conversion rate of
    approximately $11.14 per share for the 4.5% Notes and
    approximately $22.41 for the 3.75% Notes. In the event that
    all 4.5% Notes were converted for common stock, we would
    issue an aggregate of 24.2 million shares of our common
    stock. In the event that all 3.75% Notes were converted for
    common stock, we would issue an aggregate of 6.4 million
    shares of our common stock. The conversion of some or all of our
    4.5% or 3.75% Notes into our common stock could cause
    substantial dilution to existing stockholders. Any sales in the
    public market of the common stock issued upon such conversion
    could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common
    stock. In addition, the possibility that the notes may be
    converted may encourage short-selling by market participants
    because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of
    our common stock.

If we elect to satisfy the conversion obligation in cash, the
    amount of cash payable upon conversion of the notes will be
    determined by the product of (i) the number of shares
    issuable for the principal amount of the converted notes at a
    conversion rate of approximately $11.14 per share for the
    4.5% Notes and approximately $22.41 per share for the
    3.75% Notes and (ii) the average closing price of our
    common stock during a

20-day

trading period following the holders unretracted election to
    convert the notes. To the extent we decide to pay cash to settle
    any conversions and the average closing price of our common
    stock during this period exceeds $11.14 per share for the
    4.5% Notes or $22.41 for the 3.75% Notes, we would
    have to pay cash in excess of the principal amount of the notes
    being converted, which would result in the recording of a loss
    on extinguishment of debt.

On October 1, 2008, the holders of the 4.5% Notes may
    elect repayment, which would require us to pay, in cash, the
    aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, of
    the notes held by the holders who elect repayment. As a result
    of the holders’ repayment right, we reclassified the
    $270 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the
    4.5% Notes into a current obligation in October 2007.

Currently, our common stock price exceeds the conversion price.
    If our common stock price exceeds the conversion price in
    October 2008, it is not likely that any holder of the
    4.5% Notes will elect repayment on October 1, 2008,
    but it is likely that if we were to redeem the 4.5% Notes
    on or after October 8, 2008, the holders of the notes
    subject to redemption would convert their notes. On the other
    hand, if our common stock price is below the conversion price,
    it is more likely that the holders of the 4.5% Notes would
    elect repayment or would not convert upon a redemption. We have
    not yet determined whether we will use cash on hand, issue
    equity or incur additional debt to fund our cash obligation if
    we are required to repay or determine to redeem the
    4.5% Notes. We have also not yet determined whether we will
    settle any conversion obligation with respect to the
    4.5% Notes in shares of our common stock, cash or a
    combination thereof.

Certain
    provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an
    acquisition of our company more difficult.

The following provisions of our certificate of incorporation and
    bylaws, as currently in effect, as well as our stockholder
    rights plan and Delaware law, could discourage potential
    proposals to acquire us, delay or



prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that
    investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our
    common stock:

•

our certificate of incorporation permits our Board of Directors
    to issue “blank check” preferred stock and to adopt
    amendments to our bylaws;

•

our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of
    stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be
    considered at stockholder meetings;

•

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right
    of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to
    act by written consent;

•

we are subject to provisions of Delaware law which prohibit us
    from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions
    with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three
    years following the date such stockholder became classified as
    an interested stockholder; and

•

we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that could cause
    substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
    acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors or
    permitted by the stockholder rights plan.

Properties

Facilities

We lease our corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas and
    maintain facilities nationwide. Our facilities are used for
    offices, equipment yards, warehouses, storage and vehicle shops.
    As of December 31, 2007, we own 30 of the facilities we
    occupy, many of which are encumbered by our credit facility, and
    we lease the remainder. We believe that our existing facilities
    are sufficient for our current needs.

Equipment

We operate a nationwide fleet of owned and leased trucks and
    trailers, support vehicles and specialty construction equipment,
    such as backhoes, excavators, trenchers, generators, boring
    machines, cranes, wire pullers and tensioners, all of which are
    encumbered by our credit facility. As of December 31, 2007,
    the total size of the rolling-stock fleet was approximately
    25,000 units. Most of this fleet is serviced by our own
    mechanics who work at various maintenance sites and facilities.
    We believe that these vehicles generally are well maintained and
    adequate for our present operations.

ITEM 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

InfraSource, certain of its officers and directors and various
    other parties, including David R. Helwig, the former chief
    executive officer of InfraSource who became a director of Quanta
    after completion of the Merger, are defendants in a lawsuit
    seeking unspecified damages filed in the State District Court in
    Harris County, Texas on September 21, 2005. The plaintiffs
    allege that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties and
    committed constructive fraud by failing to maximize shareholder
    value in connection with certain acquisitions by InfraSource
    Incorporated that closed in 1999 and 2000 and the acquisition of
    InfraSource Incorporated by InfraSource in 2003 and committed
    other acts of misconduct following the filing of the petition.
    The parties settled this lawsuit in January 2008 and agreed to a
    dismissal of all material claims, although the dismissal has not
    yet been ordered by the court. At December 31, 2007, we had
    accrued a reserve for the settlement amount.

We are from time to time a party to various lawsuits, claims and
    other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These actions typically seek, among other things,
    compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract

and/or

property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
    losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all
    such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record



reserves when it is probable that a liability has been incurred
    and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not
    believe that any of these proceedings, separately or in the
    aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse effect
    on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Unregistered
    Sales of Securities During the Fourth Quarter of 2007

Between October 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007, Quanta
    completed one acquisition in which some of the consideration was
    unregistered securities of Quanta. The aggregate consideration
    paid in this transaction was $15.5 million in cash and
    337,108 shares of common stock. This acquisition was not
    affiliated with any other acquisition prior to such transaction.

All securities listed on the following table were shares of
    common stock. Quanta relied on Section 4(2) of the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), as the
    basis for exemption from registration. For all issuances, the
    purchasers were “accredited investors” as defined in
    Rule 501 of the Securities Act. All issuances were to the
    owners of the business acquired in privately negotiated
    transactions, and not pursuant to public solicitations.

Dividends

We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to
    finance the growth, development and expansion of our business.
    Accordingly, we currently do not intend to declare or pay any
    cash dividends on our common stock in the immediate future. The
    declaration, payment and amount of future cash dividends, if
    any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after
    taking into account various factors. These factors include our
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flows from
    operations, current and anticipated capital requirements and
    expansion plans, the income tax laws then in effect and the
    requirements of Delaware law. In addition, as discussed in

“Debt Instruments — Credit Facility”

in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”
    our credit facility includes limitations on the payment of cash
    dividends without the consent of the lenders.

Performance
    Graph

The following Performance Graph and related information shall
    not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be
    “filed” with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
    nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any
    future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that
    we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.

The following graph compares, for the period from
    December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2007, the cumulative
    stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total
    return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (the
    S&P 500 Index), the Russell 2000 Index, and a peer group
    index previously selected by our management that includes six
    public companies within our industry (the Peer Group). The
    comparison assumes that $100 was invested on December 31,
    2002 in our common stock, the S&P 500 Index, the Russell
    2000 Index and the Peer Group, and further assumes all dividends
    were reinvested. The stock price performance reflected on the
    following graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock
    price performance.

The Peer Group is composed of Dycom Industries, Inc., MasTec,
    Inc., Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., Shaw Group,
    Inc. and Pike Electric Corporation. InfraSource Services, Inc.
    was included in the Peer Group from 2004 through 2006 but has
    been deleted from the Peer Group for 2007 as a result of its
    acquisition by us in 2007. The companies in the Peer Group were
    selected because they comprise a broad group of publicly held
    corporations, each of which has some operations similar to ours.
    When taken as a whole, the Peer Group more closely resembles our
    total business than any individual company in the group.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations should be read in
    conjunction with our historical consolidated financial
    statements and related notes thereto in Item 8
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The
    discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are
    based upon our current expectations and are subject to
    uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may
    differ materially from these expectations due to inaccurate
    assumptions and known or unknown risks and uncertainties,
    including those identified in “Uncertainty of
    Forward-Looking Statements and Information” below and in
    Item 1A “Risk Factors.”

Introduction

We are a leading national provider of specialty contracting
    services, offering

end-to-end

network solutions to the electric power, gas,
    telecommunications, cable television and specialty services
    industries. We believe we are one of the largest contractors
    servicing the transmission and distribution sector of the North
    American electric utility industry. We derive our revenues from
    one reportable segment. Our customers include electric power,
    gas, telecommunications and cable television companies, as well
    as commercial, industrial and governmental entities. We had
    consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007
    of approximately $2.66 billion, of which 57% was
    attributable to electric power work, 14% to gas work, 17% to
    telecommunications and cable television work and 12% to
    ancillary services, such as inside electrical wiring,
    intelligent traffic networks, fueling systems, cable and control
    systems for light rail lines, airports and highways and
    specialty rock trenching, directional boring and road milling
    for industrial and commercial customers.

Our customers include many of the leading companies in the
    industries we serve. We have developed strong strategic
    alliances with numerous customers and strive to develop and
    maintain our status as a preferred vendor to our customers. We
    enter into various types of contracts, including competitive
    unit price, hourly rate, cost-plus (or time and materials
    basis), and fixed price (or lump sum basis), the final terms and
    prices of which we frequently negotiate with the customer.
    Although the terms of our contracts vary considerably, most are
    made on either a unit price or fixed price basis in which we
    agree to do the work for a price per unit of



work performed (unit price) or for a fixed amount for the entire
    project (fixed price). We complete a substantial majority of our
    fixed price projects within one year, while we frequently
    provide maintenance and repair work under open-ended unit price
    or cost-plus master service agreements that are renewable
    annually. Some of our customers require us to post performance
    and payment bonds upon execution of the contract, depending upon
    the nature of the work to be performed.

We generally recognize revenue on our unit price and cost-plus
    contracts when units are completed or services are performed.
    For our fixed price contracts, we typically record revenues as
    work on the contract progresses on a

percentage-of-completion

basis. Under this valuation method, revenue is recognized based
    on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion
    to total estimated costs to complete the contract. Fixed price
    contracts generally include retainage provisions under which a
    percentage of the contract price is withheld until the project
    is complete and has been accepted by our customer.

Merger
    with InfraSource Services, Inc.

On August 30, 2007, Quanta acquired, through a merger
    transaction (the Merger), all of the outstanding common stock of
    InfraSource Services, Inc. (InfraSource). Similar to Quanta,
    InfraSource provided design, engineering, procurement,
    construction, testing and maintenance services to electric power
    utilities, natural gas utilities, telecommunication customers,
    government entities and heavy industrial companies, such as
    petrochemical, processing and refining businesses, primarily in
    the United States. As a result of the Merger, Quanta enhanced
    and expanded its position as a leading specialized contracting
    services company serving the electric power, gas,
    telecommunications and cable television industries and added a
    dark fiber leasing business. The dark fiber leasing business
    consists primarily of leasing

point-to-point

telecommunications infrastructure in select markets to
    communication services providers, large industrial and financial
    services customers, school districts and other entities with
    high bandwidth telecommunication needs. The telecommunication
    services provided through this business are subject to
    regulation by the Federal Communications Commission and certain
    state public utility commissions.

Seasonality;
    Fluctuations of Results

Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to
    seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced
    by weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, project
    schedules and timing and holidays. Typically, our revenues are
    lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or
    wet conditions cause delays. The second quarter is typically
    better than the first, as some projects begin, but continued
    cold and wet weather can often impact second quarter
    productivity. The third quarter is typically the best of the
    year, as a greater number of projects are underway and weather
    is more accommodating to work on projects. Revenues during the
    fourth quarter of the year are typically lower than the third
    quarter but higher than the second quarter. Many projects are
    completed in the fourth quarter and revenues often are impacted
    positively by customers seeking to spend their capital budget
    before the end of the year; however, the holiday season and
    inclement weather sometimes can cause delays and thereby reduce
    revenues and increase costs.

Additionally, our industry can be highly cyclical. As a result,
    our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in
    new projects in various geographic regions in the United States.
    Project schedules, in particular in connection with larger,
    longer-term projects, can also create fluctuations in the
    services provided under projects, which may adversely affect us
    in a given quarter. The financial condition of our customers and
    their access to capital, variations in the margins of projects
    performed during any particular quarter, regional and national
    economic conditions, timing of acquisitions, the timing and
    magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs and interest rate
    fluctuations may also materially affect quarterly results.
    Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter or
    year may not be indicative of the results that can be expected
    for any other quarter or for any other year. You should read

“Outlook”

and

“Understanding Gross
    Margins”

for additional discussion of trends and
    challenges that may affect our financial condition and results
    of operations.



Understanding
    Gross Margins

Our gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of
    revenues. Cost of services, which is subtracted from revenues to
    obtain gross profit, consists primarily of salaries, wages and
    benefits to employees, depreciation, fuel and other equipment
    expenses, equipment rentals, subcontracted services, insurance,
    facilities expenses, materials and parts and supplies. Various
    factors — some controllable, some not —
    impact our gross margins on a quarterly or annual basis.

Seasonal and Geographical.

As discussed above,
    seasonal patterns can have a significant impact on gross
    margins. Generally, business is slower in the winter months
    versus the warmer months of the year. This can be offset
    somewhat by increased demand for electrical service and repair
    work resulting from severe weather. In addition, the mix of
    business conducted in different parts of the country will affect
    margins, as some parts of the country offer the opportunity for
    higher gross margins than others.

Weather.

Adverse or favorable weather
    conditions can impact gross margins in a given period. For
    example, it is typical in the first quarter of any fiscal year
    that parts of the country may experience snow or rainfall that
    may negatively impact our revenues and gross margin due to
    reduced productivity. In many cases, projects may be delayed or
    temporarily placed on hold. Conversely, in periods when weather
    remains dry and temperatures are accommodating, more work can be
    done, sometimes with less cost, which would have a favorable
    impact on gross margins. In some cases, strong storms or
    hurricanes can provide us with high margin emergency service
    restoration work, which generally has a positive impact on
    margins.

Revenue Mix.

The mix of revenues derived from
    the industries we serve will impact gross margins. Changes in
    our customers’ spending patterns in each of the industries
    we serve can cause an imbalance in supply and demand and,
    therefore, affect margins and mix of revenues by industry served.

Service and Maintenance versus
    Installation.

Installation work is often obtained
    on a fixed price basis, while maintenance work is often
    performed under pre-established or negotiated prices or
    cost-plus pricing arrangements. Gross margins for installation
    work may vary from project to project, and can be higher than
    maintenance work, because work obtained on a fixed price basis
    has higher risk than other types of pricing arrangements. We
    typically derive approximately 50% of our annual revenues from
    maintenance work, but a higher portion of installation work in
    any given quarter may affect our gross margins for that quarter.

Subcontract Work.

Work that is subcontracted
    to other service providers generally yields lower gross margins.
    An increase in subcontract work in a given period may contribute
    to a decrease in gross margin. We typically subcontract
    approximately 10% to 15% of our work to other service providers.

Materials versus Labor.

Margins may be lower
    on projects on which we furnish materials as our

mark-up

on
    materials is generally lower than on labor costs. In a given
    period, a higher percentage of work that has a higher materials
    component may decrease overall gross margin.

Depreciation.

We include depreciation in cost
    of services. This is common practice in our industry, but can
    make comparability to other companies difficult. This must be
    taken into consideration when comparing us to other companies.

Insurance.

Gross margins could be impacted by
    fluctuations in insurance accruals as additional claims arise
    and as circumstances and conditions of existing claims change.
    We are insured for employer’s liability and general
    liability claims, subject to a deductible of $1.0 million
    per occurrence, and for auto liability subject to a deductible
    of $3.0 million per occurrence. We are also insured for
    workers’ compensation claims, subject to a deductible of
    $2.0 million per occurrence. Additionally, we are subject
    to an annual cumulative aggregate liability of up to
    $1.0 million on workers’ compensation claims in excess
    of $2.0 million per occurrence. We also have an employee
    health care benefits plan for employees not subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, which was subject to a
    deductible of $250,000 per claimant per year until
    December 31, 2007. The deductible for employee health care
    benefits was increased to $350,000 per claimant per year
    effective January 1, 2008.

Effective upon the Merger, InfraSource became insured under
    Quanta’s property and casualty insurance program.
    Previously, InfraSource was insured for workers’
    compensation, general liability and employer’s



liability, each subject to a deductible of $0.75 million
    per occurrence. InfraSource was also insured for auto liability,
    subject to a deductible of $0.5 million per occurrence.
    InfraSource continued to operate its own health plan for
    employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements
    through December 31, 2007, which was subject to a
    deductible of $150,000 per claimant per year.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily
    of compensation and related benefits to management,
    administrative salaries and benefits, marketing, office rent and
    utilities, communications, professional fees, bad debt expense,
    letter of credit fees and gains and losses on the sale of
    property and equipment.

Revenues.

Revenues increased
    $546.4 million, or 25.9%, to $2.66 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2007. Of the $546.4 million
    increase, approximately $348.4 million relates to revenues
    of the InfraSource operating units acquired through the Merger
    for the period from September 1, 2007 through
    December 31, 2007. The remaining $198.0 million
    increase is due primarily to electric power services increasing
    by approximately $157.3 million, or 13.7%, and
    telecommunications and cable television network services
    increasing by approximately $46.9 million, or 12.9%, offset
    by a slight decrease in gas and ancillary services. The increase
    in electric power services work is primarily due to the
    increased number and size of projects that are a result of
    larger capital budgets for our customers, approximately
    $24.9 million in additional



emergency restoration service work, and improved pricing.
    Revenues from telecommunications and cable television services
    increased primarily due to increased services related to fiber
    to the premises initiatives and improved pricing.

Gross profit.

Gross profit increased
    $116.0 million, or 37.1%, to $428.7 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2007. Of the $116.0 million
    increase, approximately $61.0 million relates to gross
    profit of the InfraSource operating units acquired in the Merger
    for the period September 1, 2007 through December 31,
    2007. The additional $54.9 million increase in gross profit
    resulted primarily from increased margins associated with
    generally improved pricing for our services, higher productivity
    and good weather that favorably impacted projects in the
    Northeast during the summer months, higher volumes of emergency
    restoration service work and better absorption of fixed costs.
    These positive effects were partially offset by lower
    productivity on certain projects due to heavy rainfall in the
    south central United States during the second quarter and early
    part of the third quarter.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased $59.0 million, or 32.5%, to
    $240.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.
    As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased from 8.6% in 2006 to 9.0% in 2007. Of the
    $59.0 million increase, $28.9 million relates to
    selling, general and administrative expenses of the InfraSource
    operating units acquired in the Merger for the period of
    September 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007. The
    remaining $30.1 million increase in selling, general and
    administrative expenses resulted in part from $11.2 million
    in increased salaries and benefits costs associated with
    additional personnel, salary increases and higher performance
    bonuses, $5.2 million in increased professional fees
    primarily associated with ongoing litigation costs and
    $2.4 million in third-party integration costs that were
    incurred in 2007 as part of the InfraSource acquisition. Also
    included were $5.3 million in net losses on sales of
    equipment during 2007, as compared to $0.7 million in net
    gains on sales of equipment in 2006. Included in the
    $5.3 million in net losses in 2007 was an impairment charge
    of $3.5 million for assets held for sale as of
    December 31, 2007. As part of the Merger, management
    identified excess equipment among the combined operations and
    determined that this equipment would not be placed back into
    service. Additionally, we had increases in travel costs of
    $1.8 million and facilities costs of $1.7 million.

Goodwill impairment.

A goodwill impairment
    charge in the amount of $56.8 million was recorded during
    the year ended December 31, 2006, while no goodwill
    impairment was recorded during the year ended December 31,
    2007. As part of our 2006 annual test for goodwill impairment,
    goodwill in the amount of $56.8 million was written off as
    a non-cash operating expense associated with a decrease in the
    expected future demand for the services of one of our
    businesses, which historically served the cable television
    industry.

Interest expense.

Interest expense decreased
    $5.3 million to $21.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, due partially to the expensing of
    unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.3 million during 2006
    as a result of replacing our prior credit facility in June 2006
    and repurchasing 80.7% of our 4.0% convertible subordinated
    notes in the second quarter of 2006. The 3.75% convertible
    subordinated notes issued in the second quarter of 2006 have a
    lower interest rate than the 4.0% convertible subordinated
    notes. Additionally, interest expense has decreased as a result
    of the maturity and repayment of the remaining 4.0% convertible
    subordinated notes on July 2, 2007.

Interest income.

Interest income was
    $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to $13.9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The increase in interest income
    primarily relates to a higher average investment balance and
    higher average interest rates for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Provision for income taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes was $34.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, with an effective tax rate of 20.4%,
    compared to a provision of $47.0 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, with an effective tax rate of 74.3%. The
    lower effective tax rate for 2007 results from
    $34.4 million of tax benefits recorded in 2007 primarily
    due to a decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions
    resulting from the settlement of a multi-year Internal Revenue
    Service audit in the first quarter of 2007 and the expiration of
    various federal and state tax statutes of limitations during the
    third quarter of 2007. Excluding the tax benefits, the effective
    tax rate would have been 41% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.



The higher tax rate in 2006 results primarily from the goodwill
    impairment charge recorded during the fourth quarter of 2006,
    the majority of which is not deductible for tax purposes.
    Excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment charge, the
    effective tax rate would have been 39.2% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

    compared to 2005

Revenues.

Revenues increased
    $267.4 million, or 14.5%, to $2.11 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. Revenues for 2006 included a
    lower volume of emergency restoration services as compared to
    2005, which included the highest volume of emergency restoration
    services in our history in the wake of hurricanes in the Gulf
    Coast region of the United States. The total revenues associated
    with emergency restoration services in 2005 were approximately
    $167.5 million as compared to $106.0 million of
    emergency restoration services in 2006. Excluding emergency
    restoration service revenues from both periods, revenues derived
    from electric power services increased in 2006 approximately
    $138.2 million, or 15.3%. Actual revenues derived from
    electric power services, including emergency restoration
    services revenues, increased approximately $76.8 million,
    or 7.2%. Revenues from gas network services increased by
    approximately $90.4 million, or 45.1%, revenues from
    telecommunications and cable television network services
    increased by approximately $39.1 million, or 12.0%, and
    revenues from ancillary services increased by approximately
    $61.1 million, or 24.9%, for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. These increases in revenues are
    primarily a result of a higher volume of work from increased
    spending by our customers resulting from the continued improving
    financial health of our customers as well as improved pricing.

Gross profit.

Gross profit increased
    $58.0 million, or 22.8%, to $312.7 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. As a percentage of revenues,
    gross margin increased from 13.8% for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 to 14.8% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The increase in gross margins for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily attributable to
    higher margins on work from our electric power and gas network
    services and our telecommunications and cable television network
    services due to continued strengthening market conditions,
    improved pricing and our margin enhancement initiatives. Margins
    improved during 2006 on work from our electric power and gas
    network services despite the lower volume of higher margin
    emergency restoration services in 2006 compared to 2005, as
    discussed above. In addition, during the first half of 2006, we
    achieved higher margins on certain jobs due to better
    productivity and cost control and relatively mild weather as
    compared to the first half of 2005, which was negatively
    impacted by cost overruns during the period and weather delays
    on certain projects during the first quarter.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses decreased $4.9 million, or 2.6%, to
    $181.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.
    The $4.9 million decrease relates primarily to a decrease
    in professional fees in the amount of $9.9 million related
    to costs incurred for our margin enhancement program and for
    specific bidding activity during the year ended
    December 31, 2005 that were not incurred during the year
    ended December 31, 2006, as well as lower legal costs from
    ongoing litigation during the year ended December 31, 2006.
    These decreases were partially offset by an $8.5 million
    increase in salaries and benefits costs associated with
    increased personnel, costs of living adjustments and increased
    performance bonuses. In addition, we recorded net losses from
    sales of property and equipment in the amount of
    $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
    compared to net gains from the sales of property and equipment
    in the amount of $0.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Goodwill impairment.

A goodwill impairment
    charge in the amount of $56.8 million was recorded during
    the year ended December 31, 2006, while no goodwill
    impairment was recorded during the year ended December 31,
    2005. As part of our 2006 annual test for goodwill impairment,
    goodwill in the amount of $56.8 million was written off as
    a non-cash operating expense associated with a decrease in the
    expected future demand for the services of one of our
    businesses, which historically served the cable television
    industry.

Interest expense.

Interest expense increased
    $2.9 million to $26.8 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, primarily due to the expense of
    unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.2 million. We
    replaced our prior credit facility and expensed the remaining
    balance of unamortized debt issuance costs of $2.6 million.
    In addition, we expensed $0.7 million of unamortized debt
    issuance costs related to the repurchase of a portion of our
    4.0% convertible subordinated notes during the second quarter of
    2006. This increase was partially



offset by lower interest expense associated with lower
    outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities during 2006
    as compared to 2005.

Interest income.

Interest income was
    $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to $7.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005. The increase in interest income
    primarily relates to a higher average investment balance and
    higher average interest rates for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

Provision for income taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes was $47.0 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, with an effective tax rate of 74.3%,
    compared to a provision of $22.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, with an effective tax rate of 43.5%. The
    higher tax rate in 2006 results primarily from the goodwill
    impairment charge recorded during the fourth quarter of 2006,
    the majority of which is not deductible for tax purposes.
    Excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment charge, the
    impact of which is 35.1%, the effective tax rate would have been
    39.2% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease
    after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment charge is
    primarily due to the impact of the recording of a refund from a
    multi-year state tax claim during the second quarter of 2006 and
    the impact of tax-exempt interest income from investments in
    2006, which were not held in 2005.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Cash
    Requirements

We anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, which
    totaled $407.1 million as of December 31, 2007,
    borrowing capacity under our credit facility, and our future
    cash flows from operations will provide sufficient funds to
    enable us to meet our future operating needs, debt service
    requirements and planned capital expenditures and to facilitate
    our future ability to grow. Initiatives to rebuild the United
    States electric power grid or momentum in deployment of fiber to
    the premises may require a significant amount of additional
    working capital. We also evaluate opportunities for strategic
    acquisitions from time to time that may require cash. We believe
    that we have adequate cash and availability under our credit
    facility to meet all such needs.

Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately
    $195 million for 2008. Approximately $85 million of
    expected 2008 capital expenditures are targeted for the
    expansion of our dark fiber leasing network in connection with
    committed leasing arrangements with customers, and the majority
    of the remaining expenditures will be for operating equipment.

The 4.5% Notes are presently convertible at the option of each
    holder, and the conversion period will expire on March 31,
    2008, but may continue or resume in future periods upon the
    satisfaction of the market price condition or other conditions.
    Additionally, the 3.75% Notes were convertible during the
    third quarter of 2007, but the conversion period expired
    September 30, 2007, and the 3.75% Notes are not
    presently convertible. The 3.75% Notes could become
    convertible in future periods upon the satisfaction of the
    market price condition or other conditions. If any holder of the
    convertible notes requests to convert their notes, we have the
    option to deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a
    combination thereof, with the amount of cash determined in
    accordance with the terms of the indenture under which the notes
    were issued. During 2007, $21,000 aggregate principal
    amount of the 4.5% Notes were settled for approximately $55,000
    in cash. The difference between the principal amount and the
    cash paid was recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt in
    the income statement.

On October 1, 2008, the holders of the 4.5% Notes may
    elect repayment, which would require us to pay, in cash, the
    aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, of
    the notes held by the holders who elect repayment. As a result
    of the holders’ repayment right, we reclassified the
    $270 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the
    4.5% Notes into a current obligation in October 2007.
    Additionally, at any time on or after October 8, 2008, we
    may redeem for cash some or all of the 4.5% Notes at the
    principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The
    holders of the 4.5% Notes that are called for redemption
    will have the right to convert all or some of their notes, which
    we may satisfy by delivery of shares of our common stock, cash
    or a combination thereof, as described in further detail under

“Debt Instruments — 4.5% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes.”

Currently, our common stock is
    trading at prices in excess of the



conversion price. If our common stock price exceeds the
    conversion price in October 2008, it is not likely that any
    holder of the 4.5% Notes will elect repayment on
    October 1, 2008, but it is likely that if we were to redeem
    the 4.5% Notes on or after October 8, 2008, the
    holders of the notes subject to redemption would convert their
    notes. On the other hand, if our common stock price is below the
    conversion price, it is more likely that the holders of the
    4.5% Notes would elect repayment or would not convert upon
    a redemption. We have not yet determined whether we will use
    cash on hand, issue equity or incur additional debt to fund our
    cash obligation if we are required to repay or determine to
    redeem the 4.5% Notes. If a conversion obligation arises,
    we have also not yet determined whether we will settle it in our
    common stock, cash or a combination thereof.

Sources
    and Uses of Cash

As of December 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents
    of $407.1 million, working capital of $547.3 million
    and long-term debt of $143.8 million, net of current
    maturities. We also had $168.6 million of letters of credit
    outstanding under our credit facility, leaving
    $306.4 million available for revolving loans or issuing new
    letters of credit.

Operating
    Activities

Operating activities provided net cash to us of
    $219.2 million during 2007 as compared to
    $120.6 million and $82.4 million during 2006 and 2005.
    Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for
    our services, operating margins and the type of services we
    provide. Working capital needs are generally higher during the
    spring and summer seasons due to increased work activity.
    Conversely, working capital needs are typically lower during the
    winter months when work is usually slower due to winter weather.

Investing
    Activities

During 2007, we used net cash in investing activities of
    $120.6 million as compared to $38.5 million and
    $30.6 million used in investing activities in 2006 and
    2005. Investing activities in 2006 and the first quarter of 2007
    included purchases and sales of variable rate demand notes
    (VRDNs), which are classified as short-term investments,
    available for sale when held. We did not invest in VRDNs in the
    remaining quarters of 2007. Other investing activities in 2007
    include $127.9 million used for capital expenditures offset
    by $27.5 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment.
    During 2006 and 2005, we used $48.5 million and
    $42.6 million for capital expenditures offset by
    $10.0 million and $12.0 million of proceeds from the
    sale of equipment. The $79.5 million increase in capital
    expenditures in 2007 compared to 2006 is related primarily to
    the growth in our business and capital expenditure requirements
    of our dark fiber business acquired through the Merger.
    Additionally, Quanta made four acquisitions during 2007.
    Investing cash flows in 2007 include $20.1 million related
    to the net impact of cash paid for the acquisitions including
    $12.1 million of acquisition expenses.

Financing
    Activities

In 2007, financing activities used net cash flow of
    $78.9 million as compared to $2.7 million and
    $13.2 million used in financing activities in 2006 and
    2005. Net cash used in financing activities in 2007 resulted
    from a $60.5 million repayment of debt associated with the
    Merger and a $33.3 million repayment of the 4.0%
    convertible subordinated notes, partially offset by a
    $6.3 million tax benefit from stock-based equity awards and
    $10.3 million received from the exercise of stock options.
    The $2.7 million net use of cash in 2006 resulted primarily
    from a repayment of $7.5 million under the term loan
    portion of our prior credit facility coupled with
    $6.0 million in debt issuance costs, partially offset by
    $5.8 million in net borrowings and $4.9 million
    related to the tax benefit from stock-based equity awards and
    the exercise of stock options. The $5.8 million in net
    borrowings primarily relates to the issuance of
    $143.8 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.75%
    convertible subordinated notes and the repurchase through a
    tender offer of $139.2 million aggregate principal amount
    of our 4.0% convertible subordinated notes. The
    $13.2 million net use of cash in 2005 resulted primarily
    from a $13.3 million net repayment under the term portion
    of our prior credit facility



in order to be able to issue additional letters of credit.
    Additionally, in 2005, Quanta received a $4.3 million cash
    inflow for the issuance of stock under the 1999 Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan which was terminated in 2005 and a
    $0.8 million cash inflow related to the exercise of stock
    options, partially offset by other net debt repayments of
    $5.0 million.

Debt
    Instruments

Credit
    Facility

We have a credit facility with various lenders that provides for
    a $475.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility
    maturing on September 19, 2012. Subject to the conditions
    specified in the credit facility, we have the option to increase
    the revolving commitments under the credit facility by up to an
    additional $125.0 million from time to time upon receipt of
    additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Borrowings
    under the credit facility are to be used for working capital,
    capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The
    entire unused portion of the credit facility is available for
    the issuance of letters of credit. The credit facility was
    entered into in June 2006 as an amendment and restatement of our
    prior credit facility and has since been amended as described
    below.

During the third quarter of 2007, we entered into two amendments
    to the credit facility. The first amendment was entered into in
    connection with the consummation of the Merger and was closed
    August 30, 2007. Among other terms, the first amendment
    amended the timing of (i) the requirement of Quanta and its
    subsidiaries to pledge certain regulated assets acquired in the
    Merger and (ii) the requirement of Quanta’s regulated
    subsidiaries acquired in the Merger to become guarantors under
    the credit facility. Additionally, the first amendment provided
    an exception to the pledge of certain licenses acquired in the
    Merger, added certain security interests acquired in the Merger
    as permitted liens, added certain surety bonds acquired in the
    Merger as permitted indebtedness and permitted the sale of the
    assets of a Quanta subsidiary. The second amendment, effective
    as of September 19, 2007, increased the amount of the
    aggregate revolving commitments in effect at the time from
    $300.0 million to $475.0 million and extended the
    maturity date to September 19, 2012. The second amendment
    also permitted additional types and amounts of liens and other
    encumbrances on our assets, indebtedness that we can incur and
    investments and other similar payments that we can make.
    Additionally, the second amendment removed a minimum
    consolidated net worth covenant, reduced certain other
    restrictions and provided the opportunity for lower borrowing
    rates, commitment fees and letter of credit fees under the
    credit facility, which are described below. We incurred
    $0.8 million in costs in the third quarter of 2007
    associated with these amendments to the credit facility. These
    costs were capitalized and, along with costs incurred in
    connection with the amendment and restatement of the credit
    facility in June 2006, are being amortized until
    September 19, 2012, the amended maturity date.

As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately
    $168.6 million of letters of credit issued under the credit
    facility and no outstanding revolving loans. The remaining
    $306.4 million was available for revolving loans or issuing
    new letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the credit
    facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either
    (a) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the credit facility)
    plus 0.875% to 1.75%, as determined by the ratio of
    Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as
    defined in the credit facility), or (b) the base rate (as
    described below) plus 0.00% to 0.75%, as determined by the ratio
    of Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA.
    Letters of credit issued under the credit facility are subject
    to a letter of credit fee of 0.875% to 1.75%, based on the ratio
    of Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA. We
    are also subject to a commitment fee of 0.15% to 0.35%, based on
    the ratio of its total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA, on
    any unused availability under the credit facility. The base rate
    equals the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined
    in the credit facility) plus


/


of 1% and (ii) the bank’s prime rate.



The credit facility contains certain covenants, including
    covenants with respect to maximum funded debt to consolidated
    EBITDA, maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA and minimum
    interest coverage, in each case as specified in the credit
    facility. For purposes of calculating the maximum funded debt to
    consolidated EBITDA ratio and the maximum senior debt to
    consolidated EBITDA ratio, our maximum funded debt and maximum
    senior debt are reduced by all cash and cash equivalents (as
    defined in the credit facility) held by us in excess of
    $25.0 million. As of December 31, 2007, we were in
    compliance with all of its covenants. The credit facility limits
    certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, capital
    expenditures, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and,
    subject to certain exceptions, prohibits liens on material
    assets. The credit facility also limits the payment of dividends
    and stock repurchase programs in any fiscal year except those
    payments or other distributions payable solely in capital stock.
    The credit facility provides for customary events of default and
    carries cross-default provisions with all of our existing
    subordinated notes, our continuing indemnity and security
    agreement with our surety and all of our other debt instruments
    exceeding $15.0 million in borrowings. If an event of
    default (as defined in the credit facility) occurs and is
    continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
    in the credit facility, amounts outstanding under the credit
    facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared
    immediately due and payable.

The credit facility is secured by a pledge of all of the capital
    stock of our U.S. subsidiaries, 65% of the capital stock of
    our foreign subsidiaries and substantially all of our assets.
    Our U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the repayment of all
    amounts due under the credit facility. Our obligations under the
    credit facility constitute designated senior indebtedness under
    our 3.75% and 4.5% convertible subordinated notes. The capital
    stock and assets of certain of our regulated
    U.S. subsidiaries acquired in the Merger will not be
    pledged under the credit facility, and these subsidiaries will
    also not be included as guarantors under the credit facility,
    until regulatory approval to do so is obtained.

4.0% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding
    $33.3 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0%
    convertible subordinated notes due 2007 (4.0% Notes), which
    matured on July 1, 2007. The outstanding principal balance
    of the 4.0% Notes plus accrued interest were repaid on
    July 2, 2007, the first business day after the maturity
    date.

4.5% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding approximately
    $270.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5%
    convertible subordinated notes due 2023 (4.5% Notes). The
    resale of the notes and the shares issuable upon conversion
    thereof was registered for the benefit of the holders in a shelf
    registration statement filed with the SEC. The 4.5% Notes
    require semi-annual interest payments on April 1 and
    October 1, until the notes mature on October 1, 2023.

The 4.5% Notes are convertible into shares of our common
    stock based on an initial conversion rate of 89.7989 shares
    of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of
    4.5% Notes (which is equal to an initial conversion price
    of approximately $11.14 per share), subject to adjustment as a
    result of certain events. The 4.5% Notes are convertible by
    the holder (i) during any fiscal quarter if the last
    reported sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal
    to 120% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in
    the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the first
    trading day of such fiscal quarter, (ii) during the five
    business day period after any five consecutive trading day
    period in which the trading price per note for each day of that
    period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported
    sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate,
    (iii) upon our calling the notes for redemption or
    (iv) upon the occurrence of specified corporate
    transactions. If the notes become convertible under any of these
    circumstances, we have the option to deliver cash, shares of our
    common stock or a combination thereof, with the amount of cash
    determined in accordance with the terms of the indenture under
    which the notes were issued. During each of the quarters in 2006
    and 2007, the market price condition described in
    clause (i) above was satisfied, and the notes were
    convertible at the option of the holder. During 2007, $21,000 in
    aggregate principal amount of the 4.5% Notes were settled
    in cash upon conversion by the holders. The remaining notes are
    presently convertible at the



option of each holder, and the conversion period will expire on
    March 31, 2008, but may continue or resume in future
    periods upon the satisfaction of the market price condition or
    other conditions.

Beginning October 8, 2008, we may redeem for cash some or
    all of the 4.5% Notes at the principal amount thereof plus
    accrued and unpaid interest. The holders of the 4.5% Notes
    may require us to repurchase all or some of their notes at the
    principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest on
    each of October 1, 2008, October 1, 2013 or
    October 1, 2018, or upon the occurrence of a fundamental
    change, as defined by the indenture under which we issued the
    notes. We must pay any required repurchases on October 1,
    2008 in cash. For all other required repurchases, we have the
    option to deliver cash, shares of its common stock or a
    combination thereof to satisfy its repurchase obligation. If we
    were to satisfy any required repurchase obligation with shares
    of its common stock, the number of shares delivered will equal
    the dollar amount to be paid in common stock divided by 98.5% of
    the market price of our common stock, as defined by the
    indenture. The right to settle for shares of common stock can be
    surrendered by us. The 4.5% Notes carry cross-default
    provisions with our other debt instruments exceeding
    $10.0 million in borrowings, which includes our existing
    credit facility.

In October 2007, we reclassified the $270.0 million
    aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 4.5% Notes
    into a current obligation as the holders may elect repayment of
    the 4.5% Notes in cash on October 1, 2008. We have not yet
    determined whether we will use cash on hand, issue equity or
    incur additional debt to fund this cash obligation in the event
    the holders elect repayment.

3.75% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding
    $143.8 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75%
    convertible subordinated notes due 2026 (3.75% Notes). The
    resale of the notes and the shares issuable upon conversion
    thereof was registered for the benefit of the holders in a shelf
    registration statement filed with the SEC. The 3.75% Notes
    mature on April 30, 2026 and bear interest at the annual
    rate of 3.75%, payable semi-annually on April 30 and
    October 30, until maturity.

The 3.75% Notes are convertible into our common stock,
    based on an initial conversion rate of 44.6229 shares of
    our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 3.75% Notes
    (which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately
    $22.41 per share), subject to adjustment as a result of certain
    events. The 3.75% Notes are convertible by the holder
    (i) during any fiscal quarter if the closing price of our
    common stock is greater than 130% of the conversion price for at
    least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading
    days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
    fiscal quarter, (ii) upon our calling the 3.75% Notes
    for redemption, (iii) upon the occurrence of specified
    distributions to holders of our common stock or specified
    corporate transactions or (iv) at any time on or after
    March 1, 2026 until the business day immediately preceding
    the maturity date of the 3.75% Notes. The 3.75% Notes
    are not presently convertible, although they were convertible
    during the third quarter of 2007 as a result of the satisfaction
    of the market price condition described in clause (i)
    above. If the 3.75% Notes become convertible under any of
    these circumstances, we have the option to deliver cash, shares
    of our common stock or a combination thereof, with the amount of
    cash determined in accordance with the terms of the indenture
    under which the notes were issued. The holders of the
    3.75% Notes who convert their notes in connection with
    certain change in control transactions, as defined in the
    indenture, may be entitled to a make whole premium in the form
    of an increase in the conversion rate. In the event of a change
    in control, in lieu of paying holders a make whole premium, if
    applicable, we may elect, in some circumstances, to adjust the
    conversion rate and related conversion obligations so that the
    3.75% Notes are convertible into shares of the acquiring or
    surviving company.

Beginning on April 30, 2010 until April 30, 2013, we
    may redeem for cash all or part of the 3.75% Notes at a
    price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and
    unpaid interest, if the closing price of our common stock is
    equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion price then in
    effect for the 3.75% Notes for at least 20 trading
    days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the
    trading day immediately prior to the date of mailing of the
    notice of redemption. In addition, we may redeem for cash all or
    part of the 3.75% Notes at any time on or after
    April 30, 2010 at certain redemption prices, plus accrued
    and unpaid interest. Beginning with the six-month interest
    period commencing on April 30, 2010, and for each six-month



interest period thereafter, we will be required to pay
    contingent interest on any outstanding 3.75% Notes during
    the applicable interest period if the average trading price of
    the 3.75% Notes reaches a specified threshold. The
    contingent interest payable within any applicable interest
    period will equal an annual rate of 0.25% of the average trading
    price of the 3.75% Notes during a five trading day
    reference period.

The holders of the 3.75% Notes may require us to repurchase
    all or a part of the notes in cash on each of April 30,
    2013, April 30, 2016 and April 30, 2021, and in the
    event of a change in control of Quanta, as defined in the
    indenture, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal
    amount of the 3.75% Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.
    The 3.75% Notes carry cross-default provisions with our
    other debt instruments exceeding $20.0 million in
    borrowings, which includes our existing credit facility.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Transactions

As is common in our industry, we have entered into certain
    off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of
    business that result in risks not directly reflected in our
    balance sheets. Our significant off-balance sheet transactions
    include liabilities associated with non-cancelable operating
    leases, letter of credit obligations and surety guarantees. We
    have not engaged in any off-balance sheet financing arrangements
    through special purpose entities, and we do not guarantee the
    work or obligations of third parties.

Leases

We enter into non-cancelable operating leases for many of our
    facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow us to
    conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of
    facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them.
    We may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of
    its term, in which case we are typically liable to the lessor
    for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease.

We have guaranteed the residual value of the underlying assets
    under certain of our equipment operating leases at the date of
    termination of such leases. We have agreed to pay any difference
    between this residual value and the fair market value of each
    underlying asset as of the lease termination date. As of
    December 31, 2007, the maximum guaranteed residual value
    was approximately $145.2 million. We believe that no
    significant payments will be made as a result of the difference
    between the fair market value of the leased equipment and the
    guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no assurance
    that future significant payments will not be required.

Letters
    of Credit

Certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure
    reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf,
    such as to beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance
    programs. In addition, from time to time some customers require
    us to post letters of credit to ensure payment to our
    subcontractors and vendors under those contracts and to
    guarantee performance under our contracts. Such letters of
    credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial
    institution. The letter of credit commits the issuer to pay
    specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the
    holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified
    actions. If this were to occur, we would be required to
    reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the
    circumstances of such a reimbursement, we may also have to
    record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. We do not
    believe that it is likely that any claims will be made under a
    letter of credit in the foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2007, we had $168.6 million in
    letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility
    primarily to secure obligations under our casualty insurance
    program. These are irrevocable stand-by letters of credit with
    maturities expiring at various times throughout 2008. Upon
    maturity, it is expected that the majority of these letters of
    credit will be renewed for subsequent one-year periods.



Performance
    Bonds

Many customers, particularly in connection with new
    construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds
    issued by a financial institution known as a surety. These bonds
    provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under
    the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and
    vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay
    subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the
    surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must
    reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs.
    Under our continuing indemnity and security agreement with the
    surety and with the consent of our lenders under our credit
    facility, we have granted security interests in certain of our
    assets to collateralize our obligations to the surety. We may be
    required to post letters of credit or other collateral in favor
    of the surety or our customers in the future. Posting letters of
    credit in favor of the surety or our customers would reduce the
    borrowing availability under our credit facility. To date, we
    have not been required to make any reimbursements to the surety
    for bond-related costs. We believe that it is unlikely that we
    will have to fund significant claims under our surety
    arrangements in the foreseeable future. As of December 31,
    2007, an aggregate of approximately $926.3 million in
    original face amount of bonds issued by the surety were
    outstanding. Our estimated cost to complete these bonded
    projects was approximately $234.1 million as of
    December 31, 2007.

Contractual
    Obligations

As of December 31, 2007, our future contractual obligations
    are as follows (in thousands):

The committed capital expenditures for dark fiber networks
    represent commitments related to signed contracts with
    customers. The amounts are estimates of costs required to build
    the networks under contract. The actual capital expenditures
    related to building the networks could vary materially from
    these estimates.

Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because
    convertible note holders may convert their notes prior to the
    maturity dates.

As of December 31, 2007, we had no borrowings under our
    credit facility. In addition, our multi-employer pension plan
    contributions are determined annually based on our union
    employee payrolls, which cannot be determined in advance for
    future periods. As of December 31, 2007, the total
    unrecognized tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions was
    $49.3 million. We estimate that none of this will be paid
    within the next twelve months.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

Quanta grants credit under normal payment terms, generally
    without collateral, to its customers, which include electric
    power and gas companies, telecommunications and cable television
    system operators, governmental entities, general contractors,
    and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial
    properties located primarily in the United States. Consequently,
    we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in
    business and economic factors throughout the United States.
    However, we generally have certain



statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Under
    certain circumstances such as foreclosures or negotiated
    settlements, we may take title to the underlying assets in lieu
    of cash in settlement of receivables. Some of our customers have
    experienced significant financial difficulties. These economic
    conditions expose us to increased risk related to collectibility
    of receivables for services we have performed. No customer
    accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable as of
    December 31, 2007 or revenues for the years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2006 or 2007.

Litigation

InfraSource, certain of its officers and directors and various
    other parties, including David R. Helwig, the former chief
    executive officer of InfraSource who became a director of Quanta
    after completion of the Merger, are defendants in a lawsuit
    seeking unspecified damages filed in the State District Court in
    Harris County, Texas on September 21, 2005. The plaintiffs
    allege that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties and
    committed constructive fraud by failing to maximize shareholder
    value in connection with certain acquisitions by InfraSource
    Incorporated that closed in 1999 and 2000 and the acquisition of
    InfraSource Incorporated by InfraSource in 2003 and committed
    other acts of misconduct following the filing of the petition.
    The parties settled this lawsuit in January 2008 and agreed to a
    dismissal of our material claims, although the dismissal has not
    yet been ordered by the court. At December 31, 2007, we had
    accrued a reserve for the settlement amount.

We are from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and
    other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These actions typically seek, among other things,
    compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract

and/or

property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
    losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all
    such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record reserves when
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not believe that any
    of these proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, would be
    expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Related
    Party Transactions

In the normal course of business, we enter into transactions
    from time to time with related parties. These transactions
    typically take the form of facility leases with prior owners of
    certain acquired companies and payables to prior owners who are
    now employees.

Inflation

Due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the
    years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, inflation did
    not have a significant effect on our results.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157
    defines fair value, establishes methods used to measure fair
    value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
    periods, as it relates to financial assets and liabilities, as
    well as for any non-financial assets and liabilities that are
    carried at fair value. SFAS No. 157 also requires
    certain tabular disclosure related to results of applying
    SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” and SFAS No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. On
    November 14, 2007, the FASB provided a one year deferral
    for the implementation of SFAS No. 157 for
    non-financial assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157
    excludes from its scope SFAS No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” and its related interpretive
    accounting pronouncements that address share-based payment
    transactions. We do not currently have any material financial
    assets and liabilities or any material non-financial assets or
    liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis,
    but we do have non-financial assets that are measured at fair
    value on a nonrecurring basis including long term assets held
    and used and goodwill. Based on the November 14, 2007
    deferral of SFAS No. 157 for non-financial assets and
    liabilities, we will begin following the guidance of
    SFAS No. 157 with respect to our non-financial assets
    and liabilities that are



measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the quarter
    ended March 31, 2009. Based on the assets and liabilities
    on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2007, we do not
    expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115”. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to
    choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value that are not currently
    required to be measured. Unrealized gains and losses on items
    for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in
    earnings. SFAS No. 159 does not affect any existing
    accounting literature that requires certain assets and
    liabilities to be carried at fair value. SFAS No. 159
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. Based on the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet
    as of December 31, 2007, we do not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 159 to have any impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51.”
    SFAS No. 160 addresses the accounting and reporting
    framework for minority interests by a parent company.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and
    interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008. Accordingly, we will adopt
    SFAS No. 160, in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We
    are currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 160
    will have on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141(R) is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. Earlier application is prohibited. Assets and liabilities
    that arose from business combinations which occurred prior to
    the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) should not be adjusted
    upon the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R).
    SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a
    business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed in the business combination;
    establishes the acquisition date as the measurement date to
    determine the fair value for all assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and
    other users all of the information they need to evaluate and
    understand the nature and financial effect of the business
    combination. As it relates to recognizing all (and only) the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
    combination, costs an acquirer expects but is not obligated to
    incur in the future to exit an activity of an acquiree or to
    terminate or relocate an acquiree’s employees are not
    liabilities at the acquisition date but must be expensed in
    accordance with other applicable generally accepted accounting
    principles. Additionally, during the measurement period, which
    should not exceed one year from the acquisition date, any
    adjustments that are needed to assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed to reflect new information obtained about facts and
    circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if
    known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts
    recognized as of that date will be adjusted retrospectively. The
    acquirer will be required to expense all acquisition-related
    costs in the periods such costs are incurred other than costs to
    issue debt or equity securities. SFAS No. 141(R) will
    have no impact on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows at the date of adoption, but it
    could have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows in the future when
    it is applied to acquisitions which occur in 2009 and beyond.

In June 2007, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF
    Issue

No. 06-11,

“Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
    Share-Based Payment Awards.”

EITF 06-11

requires that a realized income tax benefit from dividends or
    dividend equivalent units paid on unvested restricted shares and
    restricted share units be reflected as an increase in
    contributed surplus and reflected as an addition to the
    Company’s excess tax benefit pool, as defined under
    SFAS No. 123R.

EITF 06-11

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
    Accordingly, we will adopt

EITF 06-11

in the first quarter of 2008. We currently do not anticipate
    declaring dividends in the near future, so

EITF 06-11

is not anticipated to have any material impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows in the near future.

In December 2007, the Securities & Exchange Commission
    (SEC) published Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110
    (SAB 110). SAB 110 expresses the views of the SEC
    staff regarding the use of a “simplified”



method, as discussed in SAB No. 107 (SAB 107), in
    developing an estimate of expected term of “plain
    vanilla” share options in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123(R). In particular, the SEC staff
    indicated in SAB 107 that it will accept a company’s
    election to use the simplified method, regardless of whether the
    company has sufficient information to make more refined
    estimates of expected term. However, the SEC staff stated in
    SAB 107 that it would not expect a company to use the
    simplified method for share option grants after
    December 31, 2007. In SAB 110, the SEC staff states
    that will continue to accept, under certain circumstances, the
    use of the simplified method beyond December 31, 2007. We
    are currently assessing the impact that SAB 110 will have
    on our consolidated financial position, results of operations,
    and cash flows.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
    results of operations are based on our consolidated financial
    statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
    The preparation of these consolidated financial statements
    requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of
    contingent assets and liabilities known to exist at the date of
    the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We
    evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical
    experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
    be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance
    that actual results will not differ from those estimates.
    Management has reviewed its development and selection of
    critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our
    Board of Directors. We believe the following accounting policies
    affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the
    preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

Revenue Recognition.

We design, install and
    maintain networks for the electric power, gas,
    telecommunications and cable television industries, as well as
    provide various ancillary services to commercial, industrial and
    governmental entities. These services may be provided pursuant
    to master service agreements, repair and maintenance contracts
    and fixed price and non-fixed price installation contracts.
    Pricing under these contracts may be competitive unit price,
    cost-plus/hourly (or time and materials basis) or fixed price
    (or lump sum basis), and the final terms and prices of these
    contracts are frequently negotiated with the customer. Under our
    unit-based contracts, the utilization of an output-based
    measurement is appropriate for revenue recognition. Under these
    contracts, we recognize revenue when units are completed based
    on pricing established between us and the customer for each unit
    of delivery, which best reflects the pattern in which the
    obligation to the customer is fulfilled. Under our
    cost-plus/hourly and time and materials type contracts, we
    recognize revenue on an input-basis, as labor hours are incurred
    and services are performed.

Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to
    total estimated costs for each contract. These contracts provide
    for a fixed amount of revenues for the entire project. Such
    contracts provide that the customer accept completion of
    progress to date and compensate us for services rendered,
    measured in terms of units installed, hours expended or some
    other measure of progress. Contract costs include all direct
    material, labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs
    related to contract performance, such as indirect labor,
    supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Much of the
    materials associated with our work are owner-furnished and are
    therefore not included in contract revenues and costs. The cost
    estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and
    experience of our engineers, project managers and financial
    professionals. Changes in job performance, job conditions and
    final contract settlements are factors that influence
    management’s assessment of the total estimated costs to
    complete those contracts and therefore, our profit recognition.
    Changes in these factors may result in revisions to costs and
    income and their effects are recognized in the period in which
    the revisions are determined. Provisions for the total estimated
    losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which
    such losses are determined. If actual results significantly
    differ from our estimates used for revenue recognition and claim
    assessments, our financial condition and results of operations
    could be materially impacted.

We may incur costs related to change orders, whether approved or
    unapproved by the customer,

and/or

claims related to certain contracts. We determine whether there
    is a probability that the costs will be recovered based upon
    evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific
    discussions or preliminary negotiations



with the customer or verbal approvals. We treat items as a cost
    of contract performance in the period incurred if it is not
    reasonably assured that the costs will be recovered, or will
    recognize revenue if it is probable that the contract price will
    be adjusted and can be reliably estimated.

As a result of the Merger, Quanta has fiber-optic facility
    licensing agreements with various customers. Revenues earned
    pursuant to these fiber-optic facility licensing agreements,
    including initial fees, and are recognized ratably over the
    expected length of the agreements, including probable renewal
    periods. Advanced billings on fiber-optic agreements are
    recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheets.

Self-Insurance.

We are insured for
    employer’s liability and general liability claims, subject
    to a deductible of $1.0 million per occurrence, and for
    auto liability subject to a deductible of $3.0 million per
    occurrence. We are also insured for workers’ compensation
    claims, subject to a deductible of $2.0 million per
    occurrence. Additionally, we are subject to an annual cumulative
    aggregate liability of up to $1.0 million on workers’
    compensation claims in excess of $2.0 million per
    occurrence. We also have an employee health care benefits plan
    for employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements,
    which was subject to a deductible of $250,000 per claimant per
    year until December 31, 2007. The deductible for employee
    health care benefits was increased to $350,000 per claimant per
    year beginning January 1, 2008.

Effective upon the Merger, InfraSource became insured under
    Quanta’s property and casualty insurance program.
    Previously, InfraSource was insured for workers’
    compensation, general liability and employer’s liability,
    each subject to a deductible of $0.75 million per
    occurrence. InfraSource was also insured for auto liability,
    subject to a deductible of $0.5 million per occurrence.
    InfraSource continued to operate its own health plan for
    employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements
    through December 31, 2007, which was subject to a
    deductible of $150,000 per claimant per year.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported
    and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
    assistance from third-party actuaries. However, insurance
    liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
    factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination
    of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of
    incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety
    program. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical
    trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate. If
    actual results significantly differ from estimates used to
    calculate the liability, our financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows could be materially impacted. As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2007, the gross amount accrued for
    self-insurance claims totaled $117.2 million and
    $152.0 million, with $73.4 million and
    $110.1 million considered to be long-term and included in
    other non-current liabilities. Related insurance
    recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2006 and 2007
    were $10.7 million and $22.1 million, of which
    $5.0 million and $11.9 million are included in prepaid
    expenses and other current assets and $5.7 million and
    $10.2 million are included in other assets, net.

Our casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods from
    August 1, 2000 to February 28, 2003 has been
    experiencing financial distress but is currently paying valid
    claims. In the event that this insurer’s financial
    situation further deteriorates, We may be required to pay
    certain obligations that otherwise would have been paid by this
    insurer. We estimate that the total future claim amount that
    this insurer is currently obligated to pay on its behalf for the
    above mentioned policy periods is approximately
    $4.5 million; however, our estimate of the potential range
    of these future claim amounts is between $2.1 million and
    $7.8 million. The actual amounts ultimately paid by us in
    connection with such claims, if any, may vary materially from
    the above range and could be impacted by further claims
    development and the extent to which the insurer could not honor
    its obligations. We continue to monitor the financial situation
    of this insurer and analyze any alternative actions that could
    be pursued. In any event, we do not expect any failure by this
    insurer to honor its obligations to us, or any alternative
    actions that we may pursue, to have a material adverse impact on
    our financial condition; however, the impact could be material
    to our results of operations or cash flow in a given period.

Valuation of Intangibles and Long-Lived
    Assets.

SFAS No. 142 provides that
    goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful
    lives not be amortized but, instead, must be tested at least
    annually for impairment, and intangible assets that have finite
    useful lives should continue to be amortized over their



useful lives. SFAS No. 142 also provides specific
    guidance for testing goodwill and other nonamortized intangible
    assets for impairment. The first step compares the fair value of
    a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If
    the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
    the second step is then performed. The second step compares the
    carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the
    fair value of the goodwill. If the fair value of the goodwill is
    less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be
    recorded in income (loss) from operations in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

SFAS No. 142 does not allow increases in the carrying
    value of reporting units that may result from our impairment
    test; therefore, we may record goodwill impairments in the
    future, even when the aggregate fair value of our reporting
    units and the company as a whole may increase. Goodwill of a
    reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual
    tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more
    likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below
    its carrying amount. Examples of such events or circumstances
    may include a significant change in business climate or a loss
    of key personnel, among others. SFAS No. 142 requires
    that management make certain estimates and assumptions in order
    to allocate goodwill to reporting units and to determine the
    fair value of reporting unit net assets and liabilities,
    including, among other things, an assessment of market
    conditions, projected cash flows, cost of capital and growth
    rates, which could significantly impact the reported value of
    goodwill and other intangible assets. When necessary, we engage
    third party specialists to assist us with our valuations. The
    valuations employ a combination of present value techniques to
    measure fair value. These valuations are based on a discount
    rate determined by management to be consistent with industry
    discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business
    model. A provision for impairment could be required in a future
    period if future operating results and residual values differ
    from our estimates. Intangible assets with definite lives are
    also reviewed for impairment if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
    realizable.

As part of our 2006 annual test for goodwill impairment,
    goodwill in the amount of $56.8 million was written off as
    a non-cash operating expense associated with a decrease in the
    expected future demand for the services of one of our
    businesses, which had historically served the cable television
    industry. This operating unit had transitioned to FTTN and FTTP
    deployments for our customers and had previously forecasted
    expectations to begin deployments of the broadband over power
    line (BPL) technology in late 2005. However, because the
    prospective BPL customers were still analyzing the costs and
    benefits of using this technology at the end of 2006, management
    determined the BPL work would be delayed. With the future
    revenue growth related to BPL delayed, and the resulting impact
    on projected cash flows reduced at December 31, 2006,
    management determined that the estimated fair value of the
    reporting unit was less than its carrying value and,
    consequently, a goodwill impairment charge was recognized. For
    this operating unit, the remaining unimpaired balance of
    goodwill is $30.3 million. This operating unit, as well as
    others that had previously served the cable television industry,
    had successfully expanded its services to include FTTN and FTTP
    services and therefore, currently operates with sufficient
    cashflows to support any remaining goodwill balances.

Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and
    our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized.
    Changes in our judgments and projections could result in a
    significantly different estimate of the fair value of reporting
    units and intangible assets and could result in an impairment.
    Variances in the assessment of market conditions, projected cash
    flows, cost of capital, growth rates and acquisition multiples
    applied could have an impact on the assessment of impairments
    and any amount of goodwill impairment charges recorded. For
    example, lower growth rates, lower acquisition multiples or
    higher costs of capital assumptions would all individually lead
    to lower fair value assessments and potentially increased
    frequency or size of goodwill impairments. Any goodwill or other
    intangible impairment would be included in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

Our goodwill is included in multiple reporting units. Due to the
    cyclical nature of our business, and the other factors described
    under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A, the
    profitability of our individual reporting units may suffer from
    downturns in customer demand and other factors. These factors
    may have a disproportionate impact on the individual reporting
    units as compared to Quanta as a whole and might adversely
    affect the fair value of the individual reporting units. If
    material adverse conditions occur that impact our reporting
    units, our



future estimates of fair value may not support the carrying
    amount of one or more of our reporting units, and the related
    goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered
    recoverable.

The estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their
    carrying value for the annual goodwill impairment test at
    December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, we believe
    the goodwill is recoverable for all of the reporting units,
    however there can be no assurances that the goodwill will not be
    impaired in future periods.

We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
    not be realizable. If an evaluation is required, the estimated
    future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are
    compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if an
    impairment of such asset is necessary. This requires us to make
    long-term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to
    the assets subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions
    about demand for our products and future market conditions.
    Since estimating future cash flows requires significant
    judgment, our projections may vary from cash flows eventually
    realized. Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions
    could require a provision for impairment in a future period. The
    effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference
    between the fair value of such asset and its carrying value.
    Such expense would be reflected in income (loss) from operations
    in the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, we
    estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets and other
    intangibles. We periodically review factors to determine whether
    these lives are appropriate.

Current and Non-Current Accounts and Notes Receivable and
    Provision for Doubtful Accounts.

We provide an
    allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account or
    note receivable is considered doubtful. Inherent in the
    assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain
    judgments and estimates relating to, among others, our
    customer’s access to capital, our customer’s
    willingness or ability to pay, general economic conditions and
    the ongoing relationship with the customer. Certain of our
    customers, several of them large public telecommunications
    carriers and utility customers, have experienced financial
    difficulties in the past. Should any major customers experience
    difficulties or file for bankruptcy, or should anticipated
    recoveries relating to the receivables in existing bankruptcies
    and other workout situations fail to materialize, we could
    experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current
    reserves. In addition, material changes in our customers’
    revenues or cash flows could affect our ability to collect
    amounts due from them.

Stock-Based Compensation.

Effective
    January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R)
    “Share-Based Payments,” which requires the measurement
    and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based
    awards made to employees and directors, including stock options,
    restricted stock and employee stock purchases related to
    employee stock purchase plans, based on estimated fair values.
    The effect of expensing the fair value of stock options did not
    have a material impact on our financial position or results of
    operations at the time of adoption through August 2007, as the
    number of unvested stock options remaining at the time of the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) was not significant.
    However, concurrent with the InfraSource acquisition, we began
    incurring compensation expense related to the InfraSource stock
    options which were converted to Quanta options as of
    August 30, 2007. Accordingly, our stock-based compensation
    policy has been identified as critical to the accounting for our
    business operations and the understanding of our results of
    operations because they involve more significant judgments and
    estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
    statements.

SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to estimate the
    fair value of stock-based awards on the grant date using an
    option pricing model. We value stock-based awards using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model is
    highly complex and dependent on key estimates by management. The
    estimates with the greatest degree of subjective judgment are
    the estimated lives of the stock-based awards and the estimated
    volatility of our stock price. The InfraSource options which
    were converted to Quanta options were valued at August 30,
    2007 to determine our estimated future compensation expense
    subsequent to the acquisition. Such valuation involved using the
    “simplified” method of estimating the life of the
    stock options, which is based on the average of the vesting term
    and the term of the option, as a result of guidance in Staff



Accounting Bulletin No. 107 issued by the SEC. We
    determined expected volatility using the historical method, as
    we have not identified a more reliable or appropriate method to
    predict future volatility.

As stock-based compensation expense recognized during the
    current period is based on the value of the portion of
    share-based awards that is ultimately expected to vest,
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated
    at the time of grant, or on the acquisition date in the case of
    the InfraSource options converted to Quanta options, in order to
    estimate the amount of stock-based awards that will ultimately
    vest. The forfeiture rate used is based on historical Quanta
    activity. The value of the portion of the award that is
    ultimately expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis
    over the requisite service periods in our statements of
    operations. If factors change and we employ different
    assumptions in the application of SFAS No. 123(R) in
    future periods or if forfeitures are different than estimated,
    the compensation expense that we record under
    SFAS No. 123(R) in future periods may differ
    significantly.

Income Taxes.

We follow the liability method
    of accounting for income taxes in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
    Under this method, deferred assets and liabilities are recorded
    for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
    financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and
    are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are
    expected to be in effect when the underlying assets or
    liabilities are recovered or settled.

We regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for
    deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain.
    The estimation of required valuation allowances includes
    estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of
    deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
    taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
    differences become deductible. We consider projected future
    taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
    assessment. If actual future taxable income differs from our
    estimates, we may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent
    we have estimated.

We began accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance
    with FASB Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as interpretation of
    SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes”
    (FIN No. 48) at January 1, 2007.
    FIN No. 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how
    companies should recognize, measure, present and disclose in
    their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or to
    be taken on a tax return. The income tax laws and regulations
    are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, we are required
    to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our
    tax positions that can materially affect amounts recognized in
    our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income.

Outlook

The following statements are based on our current expectations
    and beliefs. These statements are forward-looking, and actual
    results may differ materially.

Many utilities across the country have increased or are planning
    to increase spending on their transmission and distribution
    systems. As a result, we are seeing new construction, extensive
    pole change outs, line upgrades and maintenance projects on many
    systems and expect this trend to continue over the next several
    quarters.

We also anticipate increased spending over the next decade as a
    result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the Energy Act), which
    requires the power industry to meet federal reliability
    standards for its transmission and distribution systems and
    provides further incentives to the industry to invest in and
    improve maintenance on its systems, although rule-making
    initiatives under the Energy Act could be impacted, both in
    timing and in scope, by a new presidential administration.
    Additionally, we expect renewable energy mandates to result in
    the need for additional transmission lines and substations
    resulting from the construction of solar and wind electric
    generating power plants. As a result of these and other factors,
    we expect a continued shift in our services mix to a greater
    proportion of high-voltage electric power transmission and
    substation projects over the long term.

Several industry and market trends are also prompting customers
    in the electric power industry to seek outsourcing partners,
    such as Quanta. These trends include an aging utility workforce,
    increased spending,



increasing costs and labor issues. The need to ensure available
    labor resources for larger projects is also driving strategic
    relationships with customers.

In the telecommunications industry, there are several
    initiatives currently underway by several wireline carriers and
    government organizations that provide us with opportunities, in
    particular initiatives for fiber to the premises (FTTP) and
    fiber to the node (FTTN). Such initiatives are underway by
    Verizon and AT&T, and municipalities and other government
    jurisdictions have also become active in these initiatives. We
    are also experiencing increased spending by wireless
    telecommunications customers on their networks, as the impact of
    mergers within the wireless industry has begun to lessen. In
    addition, several wireless companies have announced plans to
    increase their cell site deployment plans over the next year,
    including the expansion of next generation technology.

Spending in the cable television industry is beginning to
    improve. Several telecommunications companies are increasing the
    pace of their FTTP and FTTN projects that will enable them to
    offer TV services via fiber to their customers. We anticipate
    that these initiatives will serve as a catalyst for the cable
    industry to begin a new network upgrade cycle to expand its
    service offerings in an effort to retain and attract customers.

Our dark fiber leasing business is also experiencing growth
    primarily through the expansion into additional geographic
    markets, with a focus within those markets on education and
    healthcare customers where secure high-speed networks are
    important. We continue to see opportunities for growth both in
    the markets we currently serve and new markets. To support the
    growth in this business, we anticipate increased capital
    expenditures.

Gas distribution installation services are driven in part by the
    housing construction market. Our gas operations thus far have
    been minimally impacted by recent declines in new housing
    construction in certain sectors of the country. While these
    operations have been challenged by lower margins overall, we are
    taking steps to improve margins, including eliminating certain
    low margin contracts and focusing on natural gas gathering
    pipeline construction.

Historically, our customers have continued to spend through
    short-term economic softness or weak recessions. A long-term or
    deep recession, however, would likely have some negative impact
    on our customers’ spending. Lower spending may not
    automatically mean less revenue for us, as utilities continue
    outsourcing more of their work, in part due to their aging
    workforce issues. We believe that we remain the partner of
    choice for utilities in need of broad infrastructure expertise,
    specialty equipment and workforce resources. Furthermore, as new
    technologies emerge for communications and digital services such
    as voice, video and data continue to converge,
    telecommunications and cable service providers are expected to
    work quickly to deploy fast, next-generation fiber networks, and
    we are recognized as a key partner in deploying these services.

On August 30, 2007, we consummated the Merger with
    InfraSource, which enhances our resources and expands our
    service portfolio through InfraSource’s complementary
    businesses, strategic geographic footprint and skilled
    workforce. We believe the combined company will be able to
    better serve our customers as demand grows in their respective
    industries.

We continue to evaluate other potential strategic acquisitions
    of companies to broaden our customer base, expand our geographic
    area of operation and grow our portfolio of services. We believe
    that additional attractive acquisition candidates exist
    primarily as a result of the highly fragmented nature of the
    industry, the inability of many companies to expand and
    modernize due to capital constraints and the desire of owners of
    acquisition candidates for liquidity. We also believe that our
    financial strength and experienced management team will be
    attractive to acquisition candidates.

With the growth in several of our markets and our margin
    enhancement initiatives, we continue to see our gross margins
    generally improve. We continue to focus on the elements of the
    business we can control, including cost control, the margins we
    accept on projects, collecting receivables, ensuring quality
    service and rightsizing initiatives to match the markets we
    serve. These initiatives include aligning our workforce with our
    current revenue base, evaluating opportunities to reduce the
    number of field offices and evaluating our non-core assets for
    potential sale. Such initiatives, together with realignments
    associated with the ongoing



integration of InfraSource operations and any other future
    acquisitions, could result in future charges related to, among
    other things, severance, retention, facilities shutdown and
    consolidation, property disposal and other exit costs.

Capital expenditures in 2008 are expected to be approximately
    $195 million. Approximately $85 million of the
    expenditures is targeted for dark fiber expansion and the
    majority of the remaining expenditures will be for operating
    equipment. We expect expenditures for 2008 to be funded
    substantially through internal cash flows or to the extent
    necessary, from cash on hand.

We believe that we are adequately positioned to capitalize upon
    opportunities and trends in the industries we serve because of
    our proven full-service operating units with broad geographic
    reach, financial capability and technical expertise. Our
    acquisition of InfraSource further enhanced these strengths.
    Additionally, we believe that these industry opportunities and
    trends will increase the demand for our services; however, we
    cannot predict the actual timing or magnitude of the impact on
    us of these opportunities and trends.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks, primarily related to increases
    in fuel prices and adverse changes in interest rates, as
    discussed below. We do not enter into derivative transactions
    for speculative purposes; however, for accounting purposes,
    certain transactions may not meet the criteria for hedge
    accounting. We are currently not exposed to any significant
    market risks or interest rate risk from the use of derivatives.
    See “

Currency Risk

” below for a discussion of
    our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk from the use of
    derivatives.

Interest Rate.

Our exposure to market rate
    risk for changes in interest rates relates to our convertible
    subordinated notes. The fair market value of our fixed rate
    convertible subordinated notes is subject to interest rate risk
    and market risk due to the convertible feature of our
    convertible subordinated notes. Generally, the fair market value
    of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall
    and decrease as interest rates rise. The fair market value of
    our convertible subordinated notes will also increase as the
    market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market
    price falls. The interest and market value changes affect the
    fair market value of our convertible subordinated notes but do
    not impact their carrying value. As of December 31, 2006
    and 2007, the fair value of our fixed-rate debt of
    $447.0 million and $413.8 million was approximately
    $692.2 million and $825.6 million, based upon market
    prices on or before such date.

Currency Risk.

The business of our Canadian
    subsidiaries is subject to currency fluctuations. We do not
    expect any such currency risk to be material.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT

Management’s
    Report on Financial Information and Procedures

The accompanying financial statements of Quanta Services, Inc.
    and its subsidiaries were prepared by management. These
    financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States, applying
    certain estimates and judgments as required.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or
    detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
    well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
    absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives
    will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the
    fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
    controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further,
    because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
    evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
    misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all
    control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
    company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
    the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
    and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or
    mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual
    acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
    management override of the controls. The design of any system of
    controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the
    likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
    any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
    potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in
    the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control
    over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal
    control over financial reporting includes those policies and
    procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
    that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
    (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based upon the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2007 to provide reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation of financial statements for external reporting
    purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal
    control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
    assurances and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

The effectiveness of Quanta Services, Inc.’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007
    has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
    which appears herein.



Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007 excluded InfraSource, which was acquired
    on August 30, 2007. Such exclusion was in accordance with
    SEC guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business
    may be omitted in management’s report on internal control
    over financial reporting, provided the acquisition took place
    within twelve months of management’s evaluation.
    Collectively, InfraSource comprised 47% of our consolidated
    assets at December 31, 2007 and 13% of our consolidated
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our
    disclosure controls and procedures were not materially impacted
    by the acquisition.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Quanta Services,
    Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, of cash flows
    and of stockholders’ equity, present fairly, in all
    material respects, the financial position of Quanta Services,
    Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
    in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
    on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements, effective January 1, 2007, the
    Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes

.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded InfraSource
    Services, Inc. from its assessment of internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 because
    InfraSource Services, Inc. was acquired by the Company in a
    purchase business combination during 2007. We have also excluded
    InfraSource Services, Inc. from our audit of internal control
    over financial reporting. InfraSource Services, Inc. and its
    related subsidiaries are wholly owned subsidiaries of the
    Company and have total assets and total revenues which represent
    47% and 13%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial
    statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31,
    2007.

    services include engineering, designing, installing, repairing
    and maintaining network infrastructure.

On August 30, 2007, Quanta acquired, through a merger
    transaction (the Merger), all of the outstanding common stock of
    InfraSource Services, Inc. (InfraSource). For accounting
    purposes, the transaction was effective as of August 31,
    2007, and results of InfraSource’s operations have been
    included in the consolidated financial statements subsequent to
    August 31, 2007. Similar to Quanta, InfraSource provided
    specialized infrastructure contracting services to the electric
    power, gas and telecommunications industries primarily in the
    United States. The acquisition enhanced and expanded
    Quanta’s capabilities in its existing services and added a
    dark fiber leasing business.

On August 31, 2007, Quanta sold the operating assets
    associated with the business of Environmental Professional
    Associates, Limited (EPA), a Quanta subsidiary. Quanta has
    presented EPA’s income statement for the current and prior
    periods as a discontinued operation in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of operations.

In the course of its operations, Quanta is subject to certain
    risk factors including, but not limited to, risks related to
    significant fluctuations in quarterly results; ability to
    eliminate duplicative costs and realize efficiencies and
    synergies related to the integration of InfraSource; additional
    risks as a result of the Merger; economic downturns; project
    delays or cancellations; dependence on fixed price contracts;
    use of percentage-of-completion accounting; internal growth and
    operating strategies; competition; impact of the Energy Policy
    Act of 2005; availability of qualified employees; management of
    growth; identification, completion and integration of
    acquisitions; recoverability of goodwill; use of estimates and
    assumptions in determining financial results and backlog;
    lawsuits and indemnity claims related to projects; being
    self-insured against potential liabilities or for claims that
    Quanta’s insurance carriers fail to pay; occupational
    health and safety matters; changes in, or interpretations of,
    existing federal, state, local or international regulations;
    capital expenditures in dark fiber leasing; replacing canceled
    or completed contracts; collectibility of receivables; ability
    to provide surety bonds; dependence on key personnel; unionized
    workforce; the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
    potential exposure to environmental liabilities; operations in
    international markets; the pursuit of work in the government
    arena; rapid technological and structural changes in the
    industries Quanta serves; access to capital; convertibility of
    Quanta’s convertible subordinated notes; and provisions in
    our corporate governing documents that could make an acquisition
    of Quanta more difficult.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Quanta include the
    accounts of Quanta and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
    significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
    eliminated in consolidation. Unless the context requires
    otherwise, references to Quanta include Quanta and its
    consolidated subsidiaries.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made in prior years’
    financial statements to conform to classifications used in the
    current year.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Use of
    Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management in
    determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist
    as of the date the financial statements are published and the
    reported amount of revenues and expenses recognized during the
    periods presented. Quanta reviews all significant estimates
    affecting its consolidated financial statements on a recurring
    basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior
    to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on
    Quanta’s beliefs and assumptions derived from information
    available at the time such judgments and estimates are made.
    Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are
    inherent in the preparation of financial statements. Estimates
    are primarily used in Quanta’s assessment of the allowance
    for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of
    property and equipment, fair value assumptions in analyzing
    goodwill, other intangibles and long-lived asset impairments,
    self-insured claims liabilities, revenue recognition under

percentage-of-completion

accounting, share-based compensation, provision for income taxes
    and purchase price allocations.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Quanta considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
    original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Short-Term
    Investments

Quanta held no short-term investments as of December 31,
    2006 or 2007; however, during 2006 and the first quarter of
    2007, Quanta invested from time to time in variable rate demand
    notes (VRDNs), which were classified as short-term investments
    available for sale. The income from VRDNs is tax-exempt to
    Quanta.

Current
    and Long-Term Accounts and Notes Receivable and Allowance for
    Doubtful Accounts

Quanta provides an allowance for doubtful accounts when
    collection of an account or note receivable is considered
    doubtful, and receivables are written off against the allowance
    when deemed uncollectible. Inherent in the assessment of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and
    estimates including, among others, the customer’s access to
    capital, the customer’s willingness or ability to pay,
    general economic conditions and the ongoing relationship with
    the customer. Under certain circumstances such as foreclosures
    or negotiated settlements, Quanta may take title to the
    underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables.
    Material changes in Quanta’s customers’ revenues or
    cash flows could affect its ability to collect amounts due from
    them. As of December 31, 2007, Quanta had total allowances
    for doubtful accounts of approximately $47.6 million.
    Should customers experience financial difficulties or file for
    bankruptcy, or should anticipated recoveries relating to
    receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations
    fail to materialize, Quanta could experience reduced cash flows
    and losses in excess of current allowances provided.

Included in accounts and notes receivable are amounts due from a
    customer relating to the construction of independent power
    plants. During 2006, the underlying assets which had secured
    these notes receivable were sold pursuant to liquidation
    proceedings and the net proceeds are being held by a trustee.
    Quanta recorded allowances for a significant portion of these
    notes receivable in prior periods. The final collection of
    amounts owed Quanta are subject to further legal proceedings,
    although after December 31, 2007 the parties reached a
    settlement agreement that, if finalized as expected, will result
    in the collection of the net receivable amount.

The balances billed but not paid by customers pursuant to
    retainage provisions in certain contracts will be due upon
    completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer.
    Based on Quanta’s experience with similar contracts in
    recent years, the majority of the retention balances at each
    balance sheet date will be



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

collected within the subsequent fiscal year. Current retainage
    balances as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 were
    approximately $39.0 million and $60.2 million and are
    included in accounts receivable. Also included in accounts and
    notes receivable as of December 31, 2007 are
    $2.1 million in retainage balances with settlement dates
    beyond the next twelve months.

Within accounts receivable, Quanta recognizes unbilled
    receivables in circumstances such as when: revenues have been
    recorded but the amount cannot be billed under the terms of the
    contract until a later date; costs have been incurred but are
    yet to be billed under cost-reimbursement type contracts; or
    amounts that arise from routine lags in billing (for example,
    for work completed one month but not billed until the next
    month). These balances exclude revenues accrued for work
    performed under fixed-price contracts as these amounts are
    recorded as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings
    on uncompleted contracts. At December 31, 2006 and 2007,
    the balances of unbilled receivables included in accounts
    receivable were approximately $92.9 million and
    $132.3 million.

Inventories

Inventories consist of parts and supplies held for use in the
    ordinary course of business and are valued by Quanta at the
    lower of cost or market primarily using the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is
    computed using the straight-line method, net of estimated
    salvage values, over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
    Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the
    lesser of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of
    the asset. Depreciation and amortization expense related to
    property and equipment was approximately $55.0 million,
    $49.4 million and $55.9 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
    when incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments,
    which extend the useful lives of existing equipment, are
    capitalized and depreciated over the adjusted remaining useful
    life of the assets. Upon retirement or disposition of property
    and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are
    removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is
    reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 144, “Accounting for Impairment or Disposal
    of Long-Lived Assets” whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
    realizable. If an evaluation is required, fair value would be
    determined by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows
    associated with the asset and comparing it to the asset’s
    carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is
    necessary. The effect of any impairment would be to expense the
    difference between the fair value of such asset and its carrying
    value.

Capitalized
    Software

In accordance with Statement of Position (“SOP”)

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use”, we capitalize costs associated
    with internally developed

and/or

purchased software systems for new products and enhancements to
    existing products that have reached the application development
    stage and meet recoverability tests. Capitalized costs included
    external direct costs of materials and services utilized in
    developing or obtaining internal-use software, payroll and
    payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly
    associated with and devote time to the internal-use software
    project and interest costs incurred, if material, while
    developing internal-use software. Capitalization of such costs
    begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases
    no later than the point at which the project is substantially
    complete and ready for its intended purpose. Those capitalized
    costs are amortized on a



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

straight-line basis over the economic useful life of the asset,
    beginning when the asset is ready for its intended use.
    Capitalized costs are included in property and equipment on the
    consolidated balance sheets.

Other
    Assets, Net

Other assets, net consist primarily of debt issuance costs,
    non-current inventory, refundable security deposits for leased
    properties, insurance claims in excess of deductibles that are
    due from Quanta’s insurers.

Debt
    Issuance Costs

As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, capitalized debt issuance
    costs related to Quanta’s credit facility and convertible
    subordinated notes were included in other assets, net and are
    being amortized into interest expense straight-line over the
    terms of the respective agreements giving rise to the debt
    issuance costs which we believe approximated the effective tax
    rate method. As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, capitalized
    debt issuance costs were $14.9 million and
    $15.8 million with accumulated amortization of
    $6.6 million and $9.3 million. For the years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, amortization expense was
    $3.6 million, $3.2 million and $2.7 million,
    respectively.

Quanta incurred $4.0 million in debt issuance costs in the
    second quarter of 2006 related to its issuance of its 3.75%
    convertible subordinated notes. These costs were capitalized and
    are being amortized over seven years until April 30, 2013,
    the date of the note holders’ first put option as discussed
    in Note 8. During the second quarter of 2006, Quanta also
    capitalized $2.0 million in connection with the amendment
    and restatement of its credit facility. Upon the amendment and
    restatement of Quanta’s credit facility in 2006, the
    obligations under the prior facility were terminated and related
    unamortized debt issuance costs in the amount of approximately
    $2.6 million were expensed in 2006 and included in interest
    expense as discussed in Note 8. In addition, during the
    second quarter of 2006, Quanta repurchased a portion of its 4.0%
    convertible subordinated notes, and as a result, Quanta expensed
    $0.7 million in unamortized debt issuance costs as interest
    expense as discussed in Note 8. In the third quarter of
    2007, Quanta incurred $0.9 million in costs associated with
    certain amendments to the credit facility. These costs were
    capitalized and, along with costs incurred in connection with
    the amendment and restatement of the credit facility in the
    second quarter of 2006, are being amortized until
    September 19, 2012, the amended maturity date.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangibles

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets,” goodwill is subject to an annual
    assessment for impairment using a two-step fair value-based test
    with the first step performed annually at year-end, or more
    frequently if events or circumstances exist that indicate that
    goodwill may be impaired. The first step involves comparing the
    fair value of each of Quanta’s reporting unit with its
    carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is determined
    using a combination of the discounted cash flow, market multiple
    and market capitalization valuation approaches. Significant
    estimates used in the above methodologies include estimates of
    future cash flows, future short-term and long-term growth rates,
    weighted average cost of capital and estimates of market
    multiples for each of the reportable units. If the carrying
    amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second
    step is performed. The second step compares the carrying amount
    of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the fair value of the
    goodwill. If the fair value of goodwill is less than the
    carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded as a
    reduction to goodwill with a corresponding charge that
    represents an operating expense. SFAS No. 142 does not
    allow increases in the carrying value of reporting units that
    may result from Quanta’s impairment test, therefore Quanta
    may record goodwill impairments in the future, even when the
    aggregate fair value of Quanta’s reporting units and Quanta
    as a whole may increase.

Quanta’s management follows the guidance outlined in
    SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations” to
    identify the existence of identifiable intangible assets.
    Quanta’s intangible assets include customer relationships,
    backlog, non-compete agreements and patented rights. The value
    of customer relationships is estimated



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

using the

value-in-use

concept utilizing the income approach, specifically the excess
    earnings method. The excess earnings analysis consists of
    discounting to present value the projected cash flows
    attributable to the customer relationships, with consideration
    given to customer contract renewals, the importance or lack
    thereof of existing customer relationships to Quanta’s
    business plan, income taxes and required rates of return. Quanta
    values backlog based upon the contractual nature of the backlog
    within each service line, using the income approach to discount
    back to present value the cash flows attributable to the backlog.

Quanta amortizes intangible assets based upon the estimated
    consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset or
    on a straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits
    consumption cannot be reliably estimated. Intangible assets
    subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment in
    accordance with SFAS No. 144 and are tested for
    recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An
    impairment loss must be recognized if the carrying amount of an
    intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount
    exceeds its fair value.

Revenue
    Recognition

Quanta designs, installs and maintains networks for the electric
    power, gas, telecommunications and cable television industries,
    as well as provides various ancillary services to commercial,
    industrial and governmental entities. These services may be
    provided pursuant to master service agreements, repair and
    maintenance contracts and fixed price and non-fixed price
    installation contracts. Pricing under these contracts may be
    competitive unit price, cost-plus/hourly (or time and materials
    basis) or fixed price (or lump sum basis), and the final terms
    and prices of these contracts are frequently negotiated with the
    customer. Under unit-based contracts, the utilization of an
    output-based measurement is appropriate for revenue recognition.
    Under these contracts, Quanta recognizes revenue when units are
    completed based on pricing established between Quanta and the
    customer for each unit of delivery, which best reflects the
    pattern in which the obligation to the customer is fulfilled.
    Under cost-plus/hourly and time and materials type contracts,
    Quanta recognizes revenue on an input-basis, as labor hours are
    incurred and services are performed.

Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to
    total estimated costs for each contract. These contracts provide
    for a fixed amount of revenues for the entire project. Such
    contracts provide that the customer accept completion of
    progress to date and compensate us for services rendered,
    measured in terms of units installed, hours expended or some
    other measure of progress. Contract costs include all direct
    material, labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs
    related to contract performance, such as indirect labor,
    supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Much of the
    materials associated with Quanta’s work are owner-furnished
    and are therefore not included in contract revenues and costs.
    The cost estimation process is based on the professional
    knowledge and experience of Quanta’s engineers, project
    managers and financial professionals. Changes in job
    performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are
    factors that influence management’s assessment of the total
    estimated costs to complete those contracts and therefore,
    Quanta’s profit recognition. Changes in these factors may
    result in revisions to costs and income, and their effects are
    recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.
    Provisions for the total estimated losses on uncompleted
    contracts are made in the period in which such losses are
    determined.

Quanta may incur costs subject to change orders, whether
    approved or unapproved by the customer,

and/or

claims related to certain contracts. Quanta determines whether
    there is a probability that the costs will be recovered based
    upon evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific
    discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer or
    verbal approvals. Quanta treats items as a cost of contract
    performance in the period incurred if it is not probable that
    the costs will be recovered, or will recognize revenue if it is
    probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be
    reliably estimated.

The current asset “Costs and estimated earnings in excess
    of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents revenues
    recognized in excess of amounts billed for fixed price
    contracts. The current liability



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

“Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on
    uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of
    revenues recognized for fixed price contracts.

As a result of the Merger, Quanta has fiber-optic facility
    licensing agreements with various customers, as described below.
    Revenues earned pursuant to these fiber-optic facility licensing
    agreements, including any initial fees or advanced billings, are
    recognized ratably over the expected length of the agreements,
    including probable renewal periods. As of December 31,
    2007, advanced billings on these licensing agreements were
    $23.2 million and are recognized as deferred revenue with
    $15.6 million considered to be long-term and included in
    other non-current liabilities.

Fiber-Optic
    Rentals

The dark fiber business acquired as part of the Merger
    constructs and leases fiber-optic telecommunications facilities
    to customers pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with
    lease terms from five to twenty-five years, including certain
    renewal options. Under those agreements, customers lease a
    portion of the capacity of a fiber-optic facility, with the
    facility owned and maintained by Quanta. Minimum future rental
    revenue related to fiber-optic facility licensing agreements
    expected to be received by Quanta as of December 31, 2007
    are as follows (in thousands):

Income
    Taxes

Quanta follows the liability method of accounting for income
    taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under this method,
    deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are
    measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected
    to be in effect when the underlying assets or liabilities are
    recovered or settled.

Quanta regularly evaluates valuation allowances established for
    deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain.
    The estimation of required valuation allowances includes
    estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of
    deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
    taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
    differences become deductible. Quanta considers projected future
    taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
    assessment. If actual future taxable income differs from these
    estimates, Quanta may not realize deferred tax assets to the
    extent estimated.

On January 1, 2007, Quanta adopted Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (FIN No. 48). FIN No. 48 prescribes a
    comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure,
    present and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax
    positions taken or to be taken on a tax return. As a result of
    the implementation of FIN No. 48, Quanta recognized a
    $1.5 million decrease in the reserve for uncertain tax



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

positions, which was accounted for as an adjustment to the
    accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2007. Including the
    effect of the $1.5 million decrease, the total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption of
    FIN No. 48 was $72.5 million. Of this total,
    $60.6 million, which is net of the federal benefit of state
    taxes, represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that,
    if recognized, would favorably impact the effective income tax
    rate in future periods. Also, as of January 1, 2007, Quanta
    had accrued $14.0 million of interest and penalties
    relating to unrecognized tax benefits. Quanta’s continuing
    practice is to recognize within the provision for income taxes
    any interest

and/or

penalties related to income tax matters.

The income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and are often
    ambiguous. As such, Quanta is required to make many subjective
    assumptions and judgments regarding its tax positions that could
    materially affect amounts recognized in its future consolidated
    balance sheets and statements of income.

Collective
    Bargaining Agreements

Certain of Quanta’s subsidiaries are party to collective
    bargaining agreements with unions representing certain of their
    employees. The agreements require such subsidiaries to pay
    specified wages and provide certain benefits to their union
    employees. These agreements expire at various times and have
    typically been renegotiated and renewed on terms that are
    similar to the ones contained in the expiring agreements.

Under certain collective bargaining agreements, the applicable
    Quanta subsidiary is required to make contributions to
    multi-employer pension plans. Were the subsidiary to cease
    participation in one or more plans, a liability could
    potentially be assessed related to any underfunding of these
    plans. The amount of any such assessment, were such an
    assessment to be made in the future, is not subject to
    reasonable estimation.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate
    fair value due to the short-term nature of those instruments.
    The fair value of Quanta’s convertible subordinated notes
    is estimated based on quoted secondary market prices for these
    notes as of year-end. At December 31, 2006, the fair value
    of the $33.3 million aggregate principal amount outstanding
    of Quanta’s 4.0% convertible subordinated notes,
    $33.3 million was approximately $32.8 million. The
    outstanding principal balance of $33.3 million of these
    notes plus accrued interest was repaid on July 2, 2007. At
    December 31, 2006 and 2007, the fair value of the
    $270.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of
    Quanta’s 4.5% convertible subordinated notes was
    approximately $496.1 million and $640.2 million. At
    December 31, 2006 and 2007, the fair value of the
    $143.8 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of
    Quanta’s 3.75% convertible subordinated notes was
    approximately $163.3 million and $185.4 million.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Prior to January 1, 2006, Quanta accounted for its
    stock-based compensation awards under APB Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” Under this
    accounting method, no compensation expense was recognized in the
    consolidated statements of operations if no intrinsic value of
    the stock-based compensation award existed at the date of grant.
    SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Based
    Compensation,” which encouraged companies to account for
    stock-based compensation awards based on the fair value of the
    awards at the date they were granted, required disclosure as to
    what net income and earnings per share would have been had
    SFAS No. 123 been followed. Had compensation expense
    for transactions under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended
    and restated March 13, 2003) (the 2001 Plan) and the 1999
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which was terminated in 2005, been
    determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, Quanta’s

Effective January 1, 2006, Quanta adopted
    SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
    Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R)), using the modified
    prospective method of adoption, which requires recognition of
    compensation expense for all stock-based compensation beginning
    on the effective date. Under this method of accounting,
    compensation cost for stock-based compensation awards is based
    on the fair value of the awards granted, net of estimated
    forfeitures, at the date of grant. Quanta values share-based
    awards using the Black-Sholes option pricing model. Forfeitures
    are estimated using historical activity. The resulting
    compensation costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over
    the service period of each award as discussed in Note 11.
    In accordance with the modified prospective method of adoption,
    Quanta has not adjusted consolidated financial statements for
    prior periods.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), Quanta
    presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the
    exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in our
    consolidated statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R)
    requires the cash flows resulting from the tax deductions in
    excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options
    (excess tax benefit) to be classified as financing cash flows.

Functional
    Currency and Translation of Financial Statements

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the majority
    of Quanta’s operations. However, Quanta has foreign
    operating subsidiaries in Canada, for which Quanta considers the
    Canadian dollar to be the functional currency. Generally, the
    currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its
    transactions, including billings, financing, payroll and other
    expenditures would be considered the functional currency, but
    any dependency upon the parent company and the nature of the
    subsidiary’s operations must also be considered. In
    preparing the consolidated financial statements, Quanta
    translates the financial statements of the foreign operating
    subsidiaries from their functional currency into United States
    dollars. Balance sheets for foreign operations are translated
    into U.S. dollars at the month-end exchange rates, while
    statements of operations are translated at average monthly
    rates, which may result in translation gains or losses. Under
    the relevant accounting guidance, the treatment of these
    translation gains or losses is dependent upon management’s
    determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary,
    involving consideration of all relevant economic facts and
    circumstances affecting the subsidiary. If transactions are
    denominated in the entity’s functional currency, the
    translation gains and losses are included as a separate
    component of stockholders’ equity under the caption
    “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” If
    transactions are not denominated in the entity’s functional
    currency, the translation gains and losses are included within
    the statement of operations.

Comprehensive
    Income

Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a
    period except those resulting from investments by and
    distributions to stockholders. As described above, Quanta
    records other comprehensive income for the foreign currency
    translation adjustment related to its foreign operations.

Derivatives

Quanta accounts for derivative transactions in accordance with
    SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivatives and
    Hedging Activities,” as amended by SFAS Nos. 137, 138
    and 149 and as interpreted by various Derivatives Implementation
    Group Issues. Quanta does not enter into derivative transactions
    for speculative purposes; however, for accounting purposes,
    certain transactions may not meet the criteria for hedge
    accounting. Accordingly, changes in fair value related to
    transactions that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting
    must be recorded in the consolidated results of operations.

In June 2007, prior to the Merger, InfraSource entered into
    three forward contracts to hedge anticipated purchases in
    U.S. dollars by a Canadian functional currency entity. Upon
    the acquisition of InfraSource, Quanta determined these forward
    contracts were not cash flow hedges because the anticipated
    purchases would not likely occur in the time periods
    contemplated when InfraSource entered into the forward
    contracts. Accordingly, changes to the fair market value of the
    forward contracts have been recorded in earnings subsequent to
    August 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31,
    2007, a loss of approximately $0.8 million was recorded to
    other expense related to these forward contracts during the
    third and fourth quarters, approximately $0.7 million of
    which related to two of the contracts settled in September and
    November of 2007 with a combined notional amount of
    approximately $7.6 million. The only contract remaining at
    December 31, 2007 had a notional amount of
    $1.7 million and expired in January 2008. It was settled in
    January 2008 for an additional loss of approximately $37,000
    that will be included in Quanta’s income statement in the
    first quarter of 2008.

Litigation
    Costs

Quanta records reserves when it is probable that a liability has
    been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably
    estimated. Costs incurred for litigation are expensed as
    incurred.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157
    defines fair value, establishes methods used to measure fair
    value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
    periods, as it relates to financial assets and liabilities, as
    well as for any non-financial assets and liabilities that are
    carried at fair value. SFAS No. 157 also requires
    certain tabular disclosure related to results of applying
    SFAS No. 144 and SFAS No. 142. On
    November 14, 2007, the FASB provided a one year deferral
    for the implementation of SFAS No. 157 for
    non-financial assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157
    excludes from its scope SFAS No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” and its related interpretive
    accounting pronouncements that address share-based payment
    transactions. Quanta does not currently have any material
    financial assets and liabilities or any material non-financial
    assets or liabilities that are carried at fair value on a
    recurring basis, but Quanta does have non-financial assets that
    are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis including
    long term assets held and used and goodwill. Based on the
    November 14, 2007 deferral of SFAS No. 157 for
    non-financial assets and liabilities, Quanta will begin
    following the guidance of SFAS No. 157 with respect to
    its non-financial assets and liabilities that are measured at
    fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the quarter ended
    March 31, 2009. Based on the assets and liabilities on its
    balance sheet as of December 31, 2007, Quanta does not
    expect the adoption of



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on its
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115”. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to
    choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments and
    certain other items that are not currently required to be
    measured at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for
    which the fair value option has been elected are reported in
    earnings. SFAS No. 159 does not affect any existing
    accounting literature that requires certain assets and
    liabilities to be carried at fair value. SFAS No. 159
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. Based on the assets and liabilities on Quanta’s
    balance sheet as of December 31, 2007, Quanta does not
    expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have any
    material impact on its consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51.”
    SFAS No. 160 addresses the accounting and reporting
    framework for minority interests by a parent company.
    SFAS No. 160 is to be effective for fiscal years, and
    interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008. Accordingly, Quanta will adopt SFAS
    no. 160 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Quanta is
    currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 160 will
    have on its consolidated financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141(R) is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. Earlier application is prohibited. Assets and liabilities
    that arose from business combinations occurring prior to the
    adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) cannot be adjusted upon
    the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R).
    SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a
    business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed in the business combination;
    establishes the acquisition date as the measurement date to
    determine the fair value for all assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and
    other users all of the information they need to evaluate and
    understand the nature and financial effect of the business
    combination. As it relates to recognizing all (and only) the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
    combination, costs an acquirer expects but is not obligated to
    incur in the future to exit an activity of an acquiree or to
    terminate or relocate an acquiree’s employees are not
    liabilities at the acquisition date but must be expensed in
    accordance with other applicable generally accepted accounting
    principles. Additionally, during the measurement period, which
    cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date, any
    adjustments needed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed to
    reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances
    that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would
    have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of
    that date will be adjusted retrospectively. The acquirer will be
    required to expense all acquisition-related costs in the periods
    such costs are incurred other than costs to issue debt or equity
    securities in connection with the acquisition.
    SFAS No. 141(R) will have no impact on Quanta’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows at the date of adoption, but it could have a material
    impact on its consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows in the future when it is applied to
    acquisitions that occur in 2009 and beyond.

In June 2007, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF
    Issue

No. 06-11,

“Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
    Share-Based Payment Awards.”

EITF 06-11

requires that a realized income tax benefit from dividends or
    dividend equivalent units paid on unvested restricted shares and
    restricted share units be reflected as an increase in
    contributed surplus and reflected as an addition to the
    company’s excess tax benefit pool, as defined under
    SFAS No. 123(R).

EITF 06-11

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
    Accordingly, Quanta will adopt

EITF 06-11

in the first quarter of 2008. Quanta does not currently
    anticipate declaring dividends in the near future, so

EITF 06-11

is not anticipated to have any material impact on Quanta’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows in the near future.

In December 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    published Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110
    (SAB 110). SAB 110 expresses the views of the SEC
    staff regarding the use of a “simplified” method, as
    discussed in SAB No. 107 (SAB 107), in developing
    an estimate of the expected term of “plain vanilla”
    share options in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). In
    particular, the SEC staff indicated in SAB 107 that it will
    accept a company’s election to use the simplified method,
    regardless of whether the company has sufficient information to
    make more refined estimates of the expected term. However, the
    SEC staff stated in SAB 107 that it would not expect a
    company to use the simplified method for share option grants
    after December 31, 2007, but that it would accept, under
    certain circumstances, the use of the simplified method beyond
    December 31, 2007. Quanta is currently assessing the impact
    that SAB 110 will have on its consolidated financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows.

ACQUISITIONS

InfraSource
    Acquisition

On August 30, 2007, Quanta acquired through the Merger all
    of the outstanding common stock of InfraSource. In connection
    with the acquisition, Quanta issued to InfraSource’s
    stockholders 1.223 shares of Quanta common stock for each
    outstanding share of InfraSource common stock, resulting in the
    issuance of a total of 49,975,553 shares of common stock
    for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
    $1.3 billion. For purposes of purchase price accounting,
    the value of the common shares issued was determined based on
    the guidance in

EITF 99-12

“Determination of the Measurement Date for the Market Price
    of Acquirer Securities Issued in a Purchase Business
    Combination”

(EITF 99-12).

EITF 99-12 states

that the value of the common stock issued in a business
    combination should be calculated using the acquirer’s
    average common stock price a few days before and a few days
    after the acquisition announcement date, which was
    March 19, 2007. Accordingly, Quanta calculated the purchase
    price based on the average market price of Quanta’s common
    stock over the five trading days ended March 21, 2007 of
    $24.67 per share. Concurrent with the closing of the Merger,
    Quanta funded the repayment of approximately $60.5 million
    of InfraSource’s outstanding borrowings under its credit
    agreement through Quanta’s available cash and cash on hand
    at InfraSource at the time of closing.

The following summarizes the allocation of the purchase price
    and estimated transaction costs related to the InfraSource
    acquisition. This allocation is based on the significant use of
    estimates and on information that was available to management at
    the time these consolidated financial statements were prepared.
    Portions of the allocation of purchase price are preliminary.
    Accordingly, the allocation will change as management continues
    to assess available information, and the impact of such changes
    may be material. Specifically, the valuation of the operating
    unit engaged in the leasing of fiber-optic telecommunications
    facilities and the associated customer leases, as well as the
    values for intangible assets and deferred and other taxes are
    preliminary and subject to material change based on the results
    of the final evaluation.

Additionally, Quanta incurred approximately $12.1 million
    of costs related to the Merger.

Although they are subject to change based on final evaluations,
    the preliminary amounts assigned to various intangible assets at
    August 31, 2007 related to the InfraSource acquisition are
    customer relationships of $95.3 million, backlog of
    $50.5 million and non-compete agreements of
    $13.0 million. The customer relationships are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over 15 years, backlog
    is being amortized based on the estimated pattern of the
    consumption of the economic benefit over a weighted average
    period of 1.9 years and the non-compete agreements are
    being amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the
    underlying contracts over a weighted average period of
    2.5 years.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
    fair value of the acquired net assets. Quanta anticipates to
    continue to realize meaningful operational and cost synergies,
    such as enhancing the combined service offerings, expanding the
    geographic reach and resource base of the combined company,
    improving the utilization of personnel and fixed assets, the
    elimination of duplicate corporate functions, as well as
    accelerating revenue growth through enhanced cross-selling and
    marketing opportunities. Quanta believes these opportunities
    contribute to the recognition of the substantial goodwill.

The pro forma combined results of operations have been prepared
    by adjusting the historical results of Quanta to include the
    historical results of InfraSource, the reduction in interest
    expense and interest income as a result of the repayment of
    InfraSource’s outstanding indebtedness on the acquisition
    date, certain reclassifications to conform InfraSource’s
    presentation to Quanta’s accounting policies and the impact
    of the preliminary purchase price allocation discussed above.
    The pro forma results of operations do not include any cost
    savings that may result from the Merger or any estimated costs
    that have been or will be incurred by Quanta to integrate the
    businesses other than those already incurred in 2007. As noted
    above, the pro forma results of operations do not purport to be
    indicative of the actual results that would have been achieved
    by the combined company for the periods presented or that may be
    achieved by the combined company in the future. For example,
    Quanta recorded tax benefits in 2007 of $33.2 million
    primarily due to a decrease in reserves for uncertain tax
    positions. Additionally, InfraSource incurred $13.4 million
    in merger-related costs prior to the Merger that have not been
    eliminated in the 2007 pro forma results of operations above.
    Items such as these, coupled with other risk factors that could
    have affected the combined company and its operations, make it
    difficult to use the pro forma results of operations to project
    future results of operations.

Quanta completed three other acquisitions, which are discussed
    below, during the year ended December 31, 2007. The pro
    forma impact of the three other acquisitions has not been
    included due to the fact that they are immaterial to
    Quanta’s financial statements individually and in the
    aggregate.

Other
    Acquisitions

In January 2007, Quanta acquired a foundation drilling company
    for a purchase price of $32.3 million, consisting of
    $20.4 million in cash and 693,784 shares of Quanta
    common stock valued at $11.9 million at the date of
    acquisition on a discounted basis as a result of the restricted
    nature of the shares. The acquisition allows Quanta to have
    in-house capabilities to construct drilled pier foundations for
    electric transmission towers and wireless telecommunication
    towers. The estimated fair value of the tangible assets was
    $11.3 million and consisted of current assets of
    $7.3 million and property and equipment of
    $4.0 million. Net tangible assets acquired were
    $5.4 million after considering liabilities of
    $5.9 million. The excess of the purchase price over net
    tangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill in the amount
    of $20.7 million and intangible

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

assets in the amount of $6.2 million, consisting of
    customer relationships, backlog and a non-compete agreement.

In May 2007, Quanta acquired a telecommunications company for a
    purchase price (including the post-closing purchase price
    adjustment for net working capital) of $4.5 million,
    consisting of $3.0 million in cash and 54,560 shares
    of Quanta common stock valued at $1.5 million at the date
    of acquisition on a discounted basis as a result of the
    restricted nature of the shares. The acquisition allows Quanta
    to further expand its telecommunications business in the western
    United States. The estimated fair value of the tangible assets
    was $1.8 million and consisted of current assets of
    $1.5 million and property and equipment of
    $0.3 million. Net tangible assets acquired were
    $1.5 million after considering liabilities of
    $0.3 million. The excess of the purchase price over net
    tangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill in the amount
    of $1.4 million and intangible assets in the amount of
    $1.6 million, consisting of customer relationships, backlog
    and a non-compete agreement.

In October 2007, Quanta acquired a foundation drilling company
    for a purchase price (excluding a post-closing purchase price
    adjustment for net working capital estimated at
    $0.2 million) of $24.5 million, consisting of
    $15.5 million in cash and 337,108 shares of Quanta
    common stock valued at $9.0 million at the date of
    acquisition on a discounted basis as a result of the restricted
    nature of the shares. The acquisition allows Quanta to further
    expand its foundation drilling business in connection with the
    construction of electric transmission infrastructure in the
    United States. The estimated fair value of the tangible assets
    was $9.6 million and consisted of current assets of
    $4.6 million and property and equipment of
    $5.0 million. Net tangible assets acquired were
    $8.5 million after considering liabilities of
    $1.1 million. The excess of the purchase price over net
    tangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill in the amount
    of $12.7 million and intangible assets in the amount of
    $3.3 million, consisting of customer relationships, backlog
    and a non-compete agreement.

During 2006, as part of our annual test for goodwill impairment,
    goodwill of $56.8 million was written off as a non-cash
    operating expense. The goodwill impairment is associated with a
    decrease in the expected future demand for the services of one
    of our businesses, which has historically served the cable
    television industry.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, Quanta recorded
    approximately $170.0 million in other intangible assets
    associated with the four acquisitions closed during that period
    of time.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATION

On August 31, 2007, Quanta sold the operating assets
    associated with the business of Environmental Professional
    Associates, Limited (EPA), a Quanta subsidiary, for
    approximately $6.0 million in cash. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 144, Quanta has presented EPA’s income
    statement for the current and prior periods as a discontinued
    operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of
    operations. Quanta does not allocate corporate debt or interest
    expense to discontinued operations. A pre-tax gain of
    approximately $3.7 million was recorded in the year ended
    December 31, 2007 and included as income from discontinued
    operation in the consolidated income statement in such period.

PER SHARE
    INFORMATION:

Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average
    number of common shares outstanding during the period, and
    diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period
    adjusted for all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents,
    except in cases where the effect of the common stock equivalent
    would be antidilutive. The amounts used to compute the basic and
    diluted earnings per share for the years ended 2005, 2006 and
    2007 is illustrated below (in thousands):

For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, stock
    options for approximately 0.2 million, 0.2 million and
    0.1 million shares, respectively, were excluded from the
    computation of diluted earnings per share because the
    options’ exercise prices were greater than the average
    market price of Quanta’s common stock. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, 0.4 million shares of unvested
    restricted stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted
    earnings per share because the grant prices were greater than
    the average market price of Quanta’s common stock. For the
    years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, the effect of
    assuming conversion of Quanta’s convertible subordinated
    notes would be antidilutive and the underlying shares were
    therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per
    share.

Credit
    Facility

Quanta has a credit facility with various lenders that provides
    for a $475.0 million senior secured revolving credit
    facility maturing on September 19, 2012. Subject to the
    conditions specified in the credit facility, Quanta has the
    option to increase the revolving commitments under the credit
    facility by up to an additional $125.0 million from time to
    time upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing
    lenders. Borrowings under the credit facility are to be used for
    working capital, capital expenditures and other general
    corporate purposes. The entire unused portion of the credit
    facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit. The
    credit facility was entered into in June 2006 as an amendment
    and restatement of Quanta’s prior credit facility and has
    since been amended as described below.

During the third quarter of 2007, Quanta entered into two
    amendments to the credit facility. The first amendment was
    entered into in connection with the consummation of the Merger
    and was closed August 30, 2007. Among other terms, the
    first amendment amended the timing of (i) the requirement
    of Quanta and its subsidiaries to pledge certain regulated
    assets acquired in the Merger and (ii) the requirement of
    Quanta’s regulated subsidiaries acquired in the Merger to
    become guarantors under the credit facility. Additionally, the
    first amendment provided an exception to the pledge of certain
    licenses acquired in the Merger, added certain security
    interests acquired in the Merger as permitted liens, added
    certain surety bonds acquired in the Merger as permitted
    indebtedness and permitted the sale of the assets of a Quanta
    subsidiary. The second amendment, effective as of
    September 19, 2007, increased the amount of the aggregate
    revolving commitments in effect at the time from
    $300.0 million to $475.0 million and extended the
    maturity date to September 19, 2012. The second amendment
    also permitted additional types and amounts of liens and other
    encumbrances on Quanta’s assets, indebtedness that Quanta
    can incur and investments and other similar payments that Quanta
    can make. Additionally, the second amendment removed a minimum
    consolidated net worth covenant, reduced certain other
    restrictions and provided the opportunity for lower borrowing
    rates, commitment fees and letter of credit fees under the
    credit facility, which are described below. Quanta incurred
    $0.8 million in costs in the third quarter of 2007
    associated with these amendments to the credit facility. These
    costs were capitalized and, along with costs incurred in
    connection with the amendment and restatement of the credit
    facility in June 2006, are being amortized until
    September 19, 2012, the amended maturity date.

As of December 31, 2007, Quanta had approximately
    $168.6 million of letters of credit issued under the credit
    facility and no outstanding revolving loans. The remaining
    $306.4 million was available for revolving loans or issuing
    new letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the credit
    facility bear interest, at Quanta’s option, at a rate equal
    to either (a) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the credit
    facility) plus 0.875% to 1.75%, as determined by the ratio of
    Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as
    defined in the



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

credit facility), or (b) the base rate (as described below)
    plus 0.00% to 0.75%, as determined by the ratio of Quanta’s
    total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA. Letters of credit
    issued under the credit facility are subject to a letter of
    credit fee of 0.875% to 1.75%, based on the ratio of
    Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA. Quanta
    is also subject to a commitment fee of 0.15% to 0.35%, based on
    the ratio of its total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA, on
    any unused availability under the credit facility. The base rate
    equals the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined
    in the credit facility) plus


/


of 1% and (ii) the bank’s prime rate.

The credit facility contains certain covenants, including
    covenants with respect to maximum funded debt to consolidated
    EBITDA, maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA and minimum
    interest coverage, in each case as specified in the credit
    facility. For purposes of calculating the maximum funded debt to
    consolidated EBITDA ratio and the maximum senior debt to
    consolidated EBITDA ratio, Quanta’s maximum funded debt and
    maximum senior debt are reduced by all cash and cash equivalents
    (as defined in the credit facility) held by Quanta in excess of
    $25.0 million. As of December 31, 2007, Quanta was in
    compliance with all of its covenants. The credit facility limits
    certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, capital
    expenditures, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and,
    subject to certain exceptions, prohibits liens on material
    assets. The credit facility also limits the payment of dividends
    and stock repurchase programs in any fiscal year except those
    payments or other distributions payable solely in capital stock.
    The credit facility provides for customary events of default and
    carries cross-default provisions with all of Quanta’s
    existing subordinated notes, its continuing indemnity and
    security agreement with its surety and all of its other debt
    instruments exceeding $15.0 million in borrowings. If an
    event of default (as defined in the credit facility) occurs and
    is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
    forth in the credit facility, amounts outstanding under the
    credit facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared
    immediately due and payable.

The credit facility is secured by a pledge of all of the capital
    stock of Quanta’s U.S. subsidiaries, 65% of the
    capital stock of its foreign subsidiaries and substantially all
    of its assets. Quanta’s U.S. subsidiaries guarantee
    the repayment of all amounts due under the credit facility.
    Quanta’s obligations under the credit facility constitute
    designated senior indebtedness under its 3.75% and 4.5%
    convertible subordinated notes. The capital stock and assets of
    certain of Quanta’s regulated U.S. subsidiaries
    acquired in the Merger will not be pledged under the credit
    facility, and these subsidiaries will also not be included as
    guarantors under the credit facility, until regulatory approval
    to do so is obtained.

4.0% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

As of December 31, 2006, Quanta had outstanding
    $33.3 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0%
    convertible subordinated notes (4.0% Notes), which matured
    on July 1, 2007. The outstanding principal balance of the
    4.0% Notes plus accrued interest were repaid on
    July 2, 2007, the first business day after the maturity
    date.

4.5% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

At December 31, 2007, Quanta had outstanding approximately
    $270.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5%
    convertible subordinated notes due 2023 (4.5% Notes). The
    resale of the notes and the shares issuable upon conversion
    thereof was registered for the benefit of the holders in a shelf
    registration statement filed with the SEC. The 4.5% Notes
    require semi-annual interest payments on April 1 and
    October 1, until the notes mature on October 1, 2023.

The 4.5% Notes are convertible into shares of Quanta’s
    common stock based on an initial conversion rate of
    89.7989 shares of Quanta’s common stock per $1,000
    principal amount of 4.5% Notes (which is equal to an
    initial conversion price of approximately $11.14 per share),
    subject to adjustment as a result of certain events. The
    4.5% Notes are convertible by the holder (i) during
    any fiscal quarter if the last reported sale



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

price of Quanta’s common stock is greater than or equal to
    120% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the
    period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the first
    trading day of such fiscal quarter, (ii) during the five
    business day period after any five consecutive trading day
    period in which the trading price per note for each day of that
    period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported
    sale price of Quanta’s common stock and the conversion
    rate, (iii) upon Quanta calling the notes for redemption or
    (iv) upon the occurrence of specified corporate
    transactions. If the notes become convertible under any of these
    circumstances, Quanta has the option to deliver cash, shares of
    Quanta’s common stock or a combination thereof, with the
    amount of cash determined in accordance with the terms of the
    indenture under which the notes were issued. During each of the
    quarters in 2006 and 2007, the market price condition described
    in clause (i) above was satisfied, and the notes were
    convertible at the option of the holder. During 2007, $21,000 in
    aggregate principal amount of the 4.5% Notes were settled
    in cash upon conversion by the holders. The remaining notes are
    presently convertible at the option of each holder, and the
    conversion period will expire on March 31, 2008, but may
    continue or resume in future periods upon the satisfaction of
    the market price condition or other conditions.

Beginning October 8, 2008, Quanta may redeem for cash some
    or all of the 4.5% Notes at the principal amount thereof
    plus accrued and unpaid interest. The holders of the
    4.5% Notes may require Quanta to repurchase all or some of
    their notes at the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
    unpaid interest on each of October 1, 2008, October 1,
    2013 or October 1, 2018, or upon the occurrence of a
    fundamental change, as defined by the indenture under which
    Quanta issued the notes. Quanta must pay any required
    repurchases on October 1, 2008 in cash. For all other
    required repurchases, Quanta has the option to deliver cash,
    shares of its common stock or a combination thereof to satisfy
    its repurchase obligation. If Quanta were to satisfy any
    required repurchase obligation with shares of its common stock,
    the number of shares delivered will equal the dollar amount to
    be paid in common stock divided by 98.5% of the market price of
    Quanta’s common stock, as defined by the indenture. The
    right to settle for shares of common stock can be surrendered by
    Quanta. The 4.5% Notes carry cross-default provisions with
    Quanta’s other debt instruments exceeding
    $10.0 million in borrowings, which includes Quanta’s
    existing credit facility.

In October 2007, Quanta reclassified the $270.0 million
    aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 4.5% Notes
    into a current obligation as the holders may elect repayment of
    the 4.5% Notes in cash on October 1, 2008. Quanta has not
    yet determined whether it will use cash on hand, issue equity or
    incur additional debt to fund this cash obligation in the event
    the holders elect repayment.

3.75% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

At December 31, 2007, Quanta had outstanding
    $143.8 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75%
    convertible subordinated notes due 2026 (3.75% Notes). The
    resale of the notes and the shares issuable upon conversion
    thereof was registered for the benefit of the holders in a shelf
    registration statement filed with the SEC. The 3.75% Notes
    mature on April 30, 2026 and bear interest at the annual
    rate of 3.75%, payable semi-annually on April 30 and
    October 30, until maturity.

The 3.75% Notes are convertible into Quanta’s common
    stock, based on an initial conversion rate of
    44.6229 shares of Quanta’s common stock per $1,000
    principal amount of 3.75% Notes (which is equal to an
    initial conversion price of approximately $22.41 per share),
    subject to adjustment as a result of certain events. The
    3.75% Notes are convertible by the holder (i) during
    any fiscal quarter if the closing price of Quanta’s common
    stock is greater than 130% of the conversion price for at least
    20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days
    ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
    fiscal quarter, (ii) upon Quanta calling the
    3.75% Notes for redemption, (iii) upon the occurrence
    of specified distributions to holders of Quanta’s common
    stock or specified corporate transactions or (iv) at any
    time on or after March 1, 2026 until the business day
    immediately preceding the maturity date of the 3.75% Notes.
    The 3.75% Notes are not presently convertible, although
    they were convertible during the third quarter of 2007 as a
    result of the



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

satisfaction of the market price condition described in
    clause (i) above. If the 3.75% Notes become
    convertible under any of these circumstances, Quanta has the
    option to deliver cash, shares of Quanta’s common stock or
    a combination thereof, with the amount of cash determined in
    accordance with the terms of the indenture under which the notes
    were issued. The holders of the 3.75% Notes who convert
    their notes in connection with certain change in control
    transactions, as defined in the indenture, may be entitled to a
    make whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion
    rate. In the event of a change in control, in lieu of paying
    holders a make whole premium, if applicable, Quanta may elect,
    in some circumstances, to adjust the conversion rate and related
    conversion obligations so that the 3.75% Notes are
    convertible into shares of the acquiring or surviving company.

Beginning on April 30, 2010 until April 30, 2013,
    Quanta may redeem for cash all or part of the 3.75% Notes
    at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
    and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Quanta’s
    common stock is equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion
    price then in effect for the 3.75% Notes for at least 20
    trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on
    the trading day immediately prior to the date of mailing of the
    notice of redemption. In addition, Quanta may redeem for cash
    all or part of the 3.75% Notes at any time on or after
    April 30, 2010 at certain redemption prices, plus accrued
    and unpaid interest. Beginning with the six-month interest
    period commencing on April 30, 2010, and for each six-month
    interest period thereafter, Quanta will be required to pay
    contingent interest on any outstanding 3.75% Notes during
    the applicable interest period if the average trading price of
    the 3.75% Notes reaches a specified threshold. The
    contingent interest payable within any applicable interest
    period will equal an annual rate of 0.25% of the average trading
    price of the 3.75% Notes during a five trading day
    reference period.

At December 31, 2007, Quanta had state net operating loss
    carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately
    $9.7 million. These carryforwards will expire as follows:
    2008, $0.7 million; 2009, $0.4 million; 2010,
    $0.4 million; 2011, $0.3 million; 2012,
    $0.2 million and $7.7 million thereafter.



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In assessing the value of deferred tax assets, Quanta considers
    whether it was more likely than not that some or all of the
    deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate
    realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
    generation of future taxable income during the periods in which
    those temporary differences become deductible. Quanta considers
    the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected
    future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
    assessment. Based upon these considerations, Quanta provides a
    valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of certain of
    its deferred tax assets to their net expected realizable value.

Quanta has not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or
    foreign withholding taxes for undistributed earnings of its
    non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007, since Quanta
    intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely. It is not
    practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized
    deferred income tax liability.

As discussed in Note 2, Quanta adopted FIN No. 48
    on January 1, 2007. A reconciliation of the beginning and
    ending balances of unrecognized tax liabilities is as follows
    (in thousands):

Balance at January 1, 2007

Balance at December 31, 2007

$

49,338

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the
    $11.7 million in settlements relates to the completion of
    IRS audits for tax years 2000 to 2004 and the $22.7 million
    reduction is due to the lapse in certain statutes of limitations
    for tax years 2000 to 2003. Of the total $49.3 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2007,
    $34.2 million, which is net of the federal benefit of state
    taxes, represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that,
    if recognized, would favorably impact the effective income tax
    rate in future periods. Quanta believes that it is reasonably
    possible that within the next 12 months the total
    unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by an additional
    $0.5 million to $1.4 million due to the expiration of
    certain statutes of limitations.

Quanta is subject to income tax in the United States, multiple
    state jurisdictions and a few foreign jurisdictions. Quanta
    remains open to examination by the IRS for tax years 2004
    through 2006 as these statutes of limitations have not yet
    expired. Quanta does not consider any state in which it does
    business to be a major tax jurisdiction under
    FIN No. 48.

Quanta had approximately $14.6 million and
    $8.1 million for the payment of interest and penalties
    accrued at December 31, 2006 and 2007. Quanta recognizes
    interest and penalties within the income tax provision.

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY:

Stockholder
    Rights Plan

Quanta has a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which one right
    to acquire Series D Junior Preferred Stock, as described
    below, has been issued and attached to each outstanding share of
    common stock. The following description of Quanta’s
    stockholder rights plan and the certificate of designations
    setting forth the terms and conditions of the Series D
    Junior Preferred Stock are intended as summaries only and are
    qualified

in their entirety by reference to the form of stockholder rights
    plan and certificate of designations to the certificate of
    incorporation filed with the SEC.

Until a distribution date occurs, the rights can be transferred
    only with the common stock. On the occurrence of a distribution
    date, the rights will separate from the common stock and become
    exercisable as described below.

A “distribution date” will occur upon the earlier of:

•

the tenth day after a public announcement that a person or group
    of affiliated or associated persons other than Quanta and
    certain exempt persons (an “acquiring person”) has
    acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the total voting
    rights of the then outstanding shares of Quanta’s common
    stock; or

•

the tenth business day following the commencement of a tender or
    exchange offer that would result in such person or group
    becoming an acquiring person.

Following the distribution date, holders of rights will be
    entitled to purchase from Quanta one one-thousandth (1/1000th)
    of a share of Series D Junior Preferred Stock at a purchase
    price of $153.33, subject to adjustment.

In the event that any person or group becomes an acquiring
    person, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a
    right, other than rights beneficially owned by the acquiring
    person, will thereafter have the right to receive upon payment
    of the purchase price, that number of shares of common stock
    having a market value equal to the result obtained by
    (A) multiplying the then current purchase price by the
    number of one one-thousandths of a share of Series D Junior
    Preferred Stock for which the right is then exercisable, and
    dividing that product by (B) 50% of the current per share
    market price of our shares of common stock on the date of such
    occurrence. If, following the date of a public announcement that
    an acquiring person has become such, (1) Quanta is acquired
    in a merger or other business combination transaction and Quanta
    is not the surviving corporation, (2) any person
    consolidates or merges with Quanta and all or part of the common
    stock is converted or exchanged for securities, cash or property
    of any other person, or (3) 50% or more of Quanta’s
    assets or earning power is sold or transferred, then the rights
    will “flip-over.” At that time, each right will
    entitle its holder to purchase, for the purchase price, a number
    of shares of common stock of the surviving entity in any such
    merger, consolidation or other business combination or the
    purchaser in any such sale or transfer with a market value equal
    to the result obtained by (X) multiplying the then current
    purchase price by the number of one one-thousandths of a share
    of Series D Junior Preferred Stock for which the right is
    then exercisable, and dividing that product by (Y) 50% of
    the current per share market price of the shares of common stock
    of the surviving entity on the date of consummation of such
    consolidation, merger, sale or transfer.

The rights will expire on March 8, 2010, unless Quanta
    terminates them before that time. A holder of a right will not
    have any rights as a stockholder of Quanta, including the right
    to vote or to receive dividends, until a right is exercised.

Limited
    Vote Common Stock

The shares of Limited Vote Common Stock have rights similar to
    shares of common stock, except that such shares are entitled to
    elect one member of the Board of Directors and are entitled to
    one-tenth of one vote for each share held on all other matters.
    Each share of Limited Vote Common Stock will convert into common
    stock upon disposition by the holder of such shares in
    accordance with the transfer restrictions applicable to such
    shares. In 2006, 95,975 shares and in 2007,
    155,634 shares of Limited Vote Common Stock were converted
    to common stock. No shares of Limited Vote Common Stock were
    converted to common stock during the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

Treasury
    Stock

Pursuant to Quanta’s stock incentive plans described in
    Note 11 (including the stock incentive plans assumed from
    InfraSource in the Merger), employees may elect to satisfy their
    tax withholding obligations upon vesting of restricted stock by
    having Quanta make such tax payments and withhold a number of
    vested shares having a value on the date of vesting equal to
    their tax withholding obligation. As a result of such employee
    elections, Quanta withheld 350,037 shares in 2005 with a
    total market value of $2.8 million, 368,179 shares in
    2006 with a total market value of $5.1 million, and
    213,403 shares in 2007 with a total market value of
    $5.1 million for settlement of employee tax liabilities.
    These shares were accounted for as treasury stock. Under
    Delaware corporate law, treasury stock is not entitled to vote
    or to be counted for quorum purposes.

Deferred
    Compensation

Pursuant to the Quanta Plans discussed in Note 11, Quanta
    issues restricted stock at the fair market value of the common
    stock as of the date of issuance. The shares of restricted stock
    issued pursuant to the Quanta Plans are subject to forfeiture,
    restrictions on transfer and certain other conditions until they
    vest, which generally occurs over three years in equal annual
    installments. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), upon
    issuance of the restricted stock, an unamortized compensation
    expense equivalent to the market value of the shares on the date
    of grant was charged to stockholders’ equity and amortized
    over the vesting period as non-cash compensation expense,
    typically three years. If shares of restricted stock were
    canceled during a given period, any remaining unamortized
    deferred compensation expense related to the issuance and any
    non-cash compensation expense previously recognized on the
    canceled shares were reversed against additional paid-in
    capital. In connection with the adoption of SFAS 123(R),
    deferred compensation is no longer recorded and the amount
    recorded as of December 31, 2005, $6.4 million, was
    reversed against additional paid-in capital in 2006.

LONG-TERM
    INCENTIVE PLANS:

Stock
    Incentive Plan

On May 24, 2007, Quanta stockholders approved the Quanta
    Services, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan). The
    2007 Plan provides for the award of restricted common stock,
    incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. The
    2001 Plan was terminated effective May 24, 2007, and no
    further awards or grants under the 2001 Plan will occur.
    Outstanding awards and grants made under the 2001 Plan will
    however continue to be governed by its terms. The 2007 Plan and
    the 2001 Plan are referred to as the Quanta Plans. The purpose
    of the Quanta Plans is to provide directors, key employees,
    officers and certain consultants and advisors with additional
    incentives by increasing their proprietary interest in Quanta.



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In connection with the Merger, Quanta assumed InfraSource’s
    2003 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan and 2004 Omnibus Stock
    Incentive Plan, in each case as amended (the InfraSource Plans).
    Outstanding awards of InfraSource stock options were converted
    to options to acquire Quanta common stock, and outstanding
    awards of InfraSource restricted common stock were converted to
    Quanta restricted common stock, each as described in further
    detail below. The InfraSource Plans were terminated in
    connection with the Merger, and no further awards will be made
    under these plans, although the terms of these plans will govern
    outstanding awards.

The 2007 Plan, which is the only plan sponsored by Quanta
    pursuant to which future awards may be made, provides for the
    award of incentive stock options (ISOs) as defined in
    Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended (the Code), nonqualified stock options and restricted
    stock (collectively, the Awards). The aggregate number of shares
    of common stock with respect to which options or restricted
    stock may be awarded may not exceed 4,000,000 shares of
    common stock. The 2007 Plan is administered by the Compensation
    Committee of the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee
    has, subject to applicable regulation and the terms of the 2007
    Plan, the authority to grant Awards under the 2007 Plan, to
    construe and interpret the 2007 Plan and to make all other
    determinations and take any and all actions necessary or
    advisable for the administration of the 2007 Plan, provided that
    the Board, or authorized committee of the Board, may delegate to
    a committee of the Board designated as the Equity Grant
    Committee, consisting of one or more directors, the authority to
    grant limited Awards to eligible persons who are not executive
    officers or non-employee directors. Specifically, the Equity
    Grant Committee has the authority to award stock options and
    restricted stock, provided (i) the aggregate number of
    shares of common stock subject to stock options

and/or

shares of restricted stock awarded by the Equity Grant Committee
    in any calendar quarter does not exceed 100,000 shares (or
    20,000 shares in any calendar quarter with respect to any
    individual) and (ii) the aggregate value of restricted
    stock awarded by the Equity Grant Committee in any calendar
    quarter does not exceed $250,000 (or $25,000 with respect to any
    individual), in each case, determined based on the fair market
    value of the common stock on the date the restricted stock is
    awarded. In connection with the adoption of the 2007 Plan, the
    Board approved the designation of the Equity Grant Committee and
    appointed John R. Colson, Quanta’s Chairman of the Board
    and Chief Executive Officer, as sole member of the committee.

All of Quanta’s employees (including its executive officers
    and directors who are also employees), non-employee directors
    and certain consultants and advisors are eligible to receive
    awards under the 2007 Plan, but only its employees (including
    executive officers and directors who are also employees) are
    eligible to receive ISOs. Awards in the form of stock options
    are exercisable during the period specified in each stock option
    agreement and generally become exercisable in installments
    pursuant to a vesting schedule designated by the Compensation
    Committee or, if applicable, the Equity Grant Committee. No
    option will remain exercisable later than ten years after the
    date of award (or five years in the case of ISOs awarded to
    employees owning more than 10% of our voting capital stock). The
    exercise price for ISOs awarded under the 2007 Plan may be no
    less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on
    the date of award (or 110% in the case of ISOs awarded to
    employees owning more than 10% of our voting capital stock).
    Upon the exercise of new stock options, Quanta has historically
    issued shares of common stock rather than treasury shares or
    shares purchased on the open market, although the plan permits
    any of the three. Awards in the form of restricted stock are
    subject to forfeiture and other restrictions until they vest.
    Except in certain limited circumstances and with respect to
    restricted stock awards awarded by the Compensation Committee
    covering in the aggregate no more than 200,000 shares of
    common stock, any restricted stock award that vests on the basis
    of a grantee’s continuous service shall not provide for
    vesting that is any more rapid than annual pro rata vesting over
    a three year period, and any restricted stock award that vests
    upon the attainment of performance goals established by the
    Compensation Committee shall provide for a performance period of
    at least twelve months, in each case, as designated by the
    Compensation Committee or, if applicable, the Equity Grant
    Committee and as specified in each award agreement.

Stock
    Options

Beginning January 1, 2006, Quanta accounted for its stock
    options in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R); however,
    the effect of expensing the fair value of the stock options did
    not have a material impact on Quanta’s financial position
    or results or operations, as the number of unvested stock
    options remaining at the time of the adoption of
    SFAS 123(R) was not significant. No stock options have been
    granted by Quanta since November 2002. As of December 31,
    2006 and 2007, the number of options outstanding under the 2001
    Plan, all of which have vested, was not material. Options under
    the 2001 Plan exercised generated $4.1 million of cash
    proceeds and $1.6 million of associated income tax benefits
    in 2007. Options granted under the InfraSource Plans assumed in
    connection with the Merger are discussed below.

In connection with the Merger, each option to purchase shares of
    InfraSource common stock granted under the InfraSource Plans
    that was outstanding on August 30, 2007 was converted into
    an option to purchase the number of whole shares of Quanta
    common stock that was equal to the number of shares of
    InfraSource common stock subject to that option immediately
    prior to the effective time of the Merger multiplied by 1.223.
    These options were converted on the same terms and conditions as
    applied to each such option immediately prior to the Merger. The
    exercise price for each InfraSource option granted was also
    adjusted by dividing the exercise price in effect immediately
    prior to the Merger for each InfraSource option by 1.223. The
    former InfraSource options generally vest over four years and
    have a maximum term of ten years; however, some options vested
    on August 30, 2007 due to change of control provisions in
    place in certain InfraSource option or management agreements,
    and there has been and may be additional accelerated vesting if
    the employment of certain option holders is terminated within a
    certain period following the Merger.

In connection with the Merger, Quanta calculated the fair value
    of the former InfraSource stock options as of August 30,
    2007 using the Black-Scholes model. Assumptions used in this
    model were based on estimates derived from historic estimate of
    both Quanta and InfraSource. Quanta estimated expected stock
    price volatility based on the historical volatility of
    Quanta’s common stock. The risk-free interest rate
    assumption included in the calculation is based upon observed
    interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the
    InfraSource options. The dividend yield assumption is based on
    Quanta’s intent not to issue a dividend. Quanta currently
    uses the simplified method to calculate expected term.
    Forfeitures were estimated based on Quanta’s historical
    experience. These assumptions remained unchanged at
    December 31, 2007.

The aggregate intrinsic value above represents the total pre-tax
    intrinsic value, based on Quanta’s closing stock price of
    $26.24 on December 31, 2007, which would have been received
    by the option holders had all option holders exercised their
    options as of that date. Former InfraSource options exercised
    during the period from August 31, 2007 through
    December 31, 2007 had an intrinsic value of
    $8.1 million, generated $6.2 million of cash proceeds
    and generated $3.2 million of associated income tax
    benefit. The total number of shares related to

in-the-money

options exercisable on December 31, 2007 was 822,953. When
    stock options are exercised, Quanta has historically issued new
    shares to the option holders.

As of December 31, 2007, there was approximately
    $6.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
    related to unvested stock options issued under the InfraSource
    Plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted
    average period of 2.2 years. The total fair value of the
    stock options issued under the InfraSource Plans that vested
    during the period from September through December 2007 was
    $8.6 million.

The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from
    option exercises totaled approximately $0.4 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 and $4.1 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2007. These tax benefits are
    reported as cash inflows from financing activities and as
    adjustments to net income to derive cash flow from operations
    within the statement of cash flows for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2007, as required by
    SFAS No. 123(R). As discussed in Note 2 above,
    prior periods have not been adjusted in accordance with the
    modified prospective method of application.

Restricted
    Stock

Under the Quanta Plans, Quanta issues restricted common stock at
    the fair market value of the common stock as of the date of
    issuance. The shares of restricted common stock issued are
    subject to forfeiture, restrictions on transfer and certain
    other conditions until they vest, which generally occurs over
    three years in equal annual installments. During the restriction
    period, the restricted stockholders are entitled to vote and
    receive dividends on such shares.

In connection with the Merger, each share of restricted common
    stock issued under the InfraSource Plans that was outstanding on
    August 30, 2007 was converted into 1.223 restricted shares
    of Quanta common stock. The shares of restricted common stock
    issued under the InfraSource Plans remain subject to forfeiture,
    restrictions on transfer and certain other conditions of the
    awards until they vest, which generally occurs in equal annual
    installments over three or four year periods commencing on the
    first anniversary of the grant date, with certain exceptions.
    During the restriction period, the restricted stockholders are
    entitled to vote and receive dividends on such shares. The
    vesting period for some holders of restricted stock accelerated
    and the forfeiture and transfer restrictions lapsed when their
    employment was terminated.

During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007,
    Quanta granted 0.7 million, 0.7 million and
    0.4 million shares of restricted stock under the Quanta
    Plans with a weighted average grant price of $7.58, $13.98 and
    $25.72, respectively. During the years ended December 31,
    2005, 2006 and 2007, 1.1 million, 1.2 million and
    0.7 million shares vested with an approximate fair value at
    the time of vesting of $8.9 million, $16.9 million and
    $16.9 million, respectively. Vested amounts in 2007 include
    restricted shares that vested under the InfraSource Plans
    following the Merger.

As of December 31, 2007, there was approximately
    $12.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
    related to unvested restricted stock granted to both employees
    and non-employees. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted average period of 1.52 years.

Compensation expense is measured based on the fair value of the
    restricted stock and is recognized on a straight-line basis over
    the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. The
    fair value of the restricted stock is determined based on the
    number of shares granted and the closing price of Quanta’s
    common stock on the date of grant. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires estimating future forfeitures
    in determining the period expense, rather than recording
    forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. Quanta uses
    historical data to estimate the forfeiture rate. The effect of
    estimating forfeitures in determining the period expense, rather
    than recording forfeitures as they actually occurred, was not
    significant. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006
    and 2007, Quanta recorded non-cash compensation expense with
    respect to restricted stock in the amount of $5.0 million,
    $6.0 million and $7.9 million, respectively, and a
    related income tax benefit of $1.9 million,
    $2.4 million and $3.7 million, respectively.

The estimate of unrecognized compensation cost uses the expected
    forfeiture rate; however, the estimate may not necessarily
    represent the value that will ultimately be realized as
    compensation expense. As of December 31, 2005, unrecognized
    compensation expense related to unvested shares of restricted
    stock granted to employees was recorded as deferred compensation
    in stockholders’ equity. As part of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), $6.4 million of deferred
    compensation was reversed against additional paid-in capital
    during the first quarter of 2006.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plans

The 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP) was adopted by
    the Board of Directors of Quanta and was approved by the
    stockholders of Quanta in May 1999. The ESPP was terminated
    during 2005. The purpose of the ESPP was to provide an incentive
    for employees of Quanta and any Participating Company (as
    defined in the ESPP) to acquire or increase a proprietary
    interest in Quanta through the purchase of shares of
    Quanta’s common stock. The ESPP was intended to qualify as
    an “Employee Stock Purchase Plan” under
    Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended (the Code). The provisions of the ESPP were construed in
    a manner consistent with the requirements of that section of the
    Code. The ESPP was administered by a committee, appointed from
    time to time, by the Board of Directors. The ESPP was not
    subject to any of the provisions of the Employee Retirement
    Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. During 2005, Quanta
    issued 674,759 shares pursuant to the ESPP. Additionally,
    InfraSource had a 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2004 ESPP),
    which was terminated prior to the Merger. Quanta did not assume
    any liability related to the 2004 ESPP but will receive tax
    benefits as shares are sold from the 2004 ESPP.

Non-Cash
    Compensation Expense and Related Tax Benefits

The amounts of non-cash compensation expense and related tax
    benefits, as well as the amount of actual tax benefits related

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS:

Union’s
    Multi-Employer Pension Plans

Under collective bargaining agreements between certain unions
    and various Quanta subsidiaries, the subsidiaries participate
    with other companies in multi-employer pension plans. These
    plans typically cover all of the subsidiaries’ employees
    who are members of such unions. The Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension
    Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon
    employers who are contributors to a multi-employer plan in the
    event of the employer’s withdrawal from, or upon
    termination of, such plan. None of Quanta’s subsidiaries
    have any current plans to withdraw from these plans. Because no
    Quanta subsidiary is currently contemplating a withdrawal from
    any plan, it is not possible to ascertain the net assets and
    actuarial present value of the plans’ unfunded vested
    benefits allocable to any Quanta subsidiary, and the amounts, if
    any, for which any Quanta subsidiary may be contingently liable,
    if such a withdrawal from a plan were to occur in the future. In
    addition, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding
    rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007
    for multi-employer plans that are classified as
    “endangered,” “seriously endangered,” or
    “critical” status. For a plan in critical status,
    additional required contributions and benefit reductions apply;
    however, Quanta is not currently aware of any multi-employer
    plan to which any Quanta subsidiary contributes being in
    “critical” status. Contributions to all union
    multi-employer pension plans by Quanta were approximately
    $50.3 million, $53.1 million and $69.7 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007,
    respectively.

Quanta
    401(k) Plan

Quanta has a 401(k) plan pursuant to which employees who are not
    provided retirement benefits through a collective bargaining
    agreement may make contributions through a payroll deduction.
    Quanta makes matching cash contributions of 100% of each
    employee’s contribution up to 3% of that employee’s
    salary and 50% of each employee’s contribution between 3%
    and 6% of such employee’s salary, up to the maximum amount
    permitted by law. Prior to joining Quanta’s 401(k) plan,
    certain subsidiaries of Quanta provided various defined
    contribution plans to their employees. Contributions to all
    non-union defined contribution plans by Quanta were
    approximately $5.3 million, $5.6 million and
    $6.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
    2006 and 2007, respectively.

13.

RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

Certain of Quanta’s subsidiaries have entered into related
    party lease arrangements for operational facilities, typically
    with prior owners of certain acquired businesses. These lease
    agreements generally have terms of up to five years. Related
    party lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2005,
    2006 and 2007 was approximately $3.2 million,
    $2.6 million and $4.0 million, respectively.

14.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES:

Leases

Quanta leases certain land, buildings and equipment under
    non-cancelable lease agreements, including related party leases
    as discussed in Note 13. The terms of these agreements vary
    from lease to lease, including

some with renewal options and escalation clauses. The following

Rent expense related to operating leases was approximately
    $64.5 million, $78.3 million and $86.7 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007,
    respectively.

Quanta has guaranteed the residual value on certain of its
    equipment operating leases. Quanta guarantees the difference
    between this residual value and the fair market value of the
    underlying asset at the date of termination of the leases. At
    December 31, 2007, the maximum guaranteed residual value
    was approximately $145.2 million. Quanta believes that no
    significant payments will be made as a result of the difference
    between the fair market value of the leased equipment and the
    guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no assurance
    that significant payments will not be required in the future.

Committed
    Capital Expenditures

Quanta has committed various amounts of capital for expansion of
    its dark fiber network. Quanta does not commit capital to new
    network expansions until it has a committed lease arrangement in
    place with at least one customer. The amounts of committed
    capital expenditures are estimates of costs required to build
    the networks under contract. The actual capital expenditures
    related to building the networks could vary materially from
    these estimates. Quanta estimates that these expenditures to be
    approximately $79.5 million, $48.4 million and
    $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2008 and 2009.

Litigation

InfraSource, certain of its officers and directors and various
    other parties, including David R. Helwig, the former chief
    executive officer of InfraSource who became a director of Quanta
    after completion of the Merger, are defendants in a lawsuit
    seeking unspecified damages filed in the State District Court in
    Harris County, Texas on September 21, 2005. The plaintiffs
    allege that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties and
    committed constructive fraud by failing to maximize shareholder
    value in connection with certain acquisitions by InfraSource
    Incorporated that closed in 1999 and 2000 and the acquisition of
    InfraSource Incorporated by InfraSource in 2003 and committed
    other acts of misconduct following the filing of the petition.
    The parties settled this lawsuit in January 2008, and agreed to
    a dismissal of all material claims, although the dismissal has
    not yet been finalized by the court. At December 31, 2007,
    Quanta has accrued a reserve for the settlement amount an amount.

Quanta is also from time to time party to various lawsuits,
    claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary
    course of business. These actions typically seek, among other
    things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of
    contract

and/or

property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
    losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all
    such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, Quanta records reserves
    when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
    amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Quanta does not
    believe that any of these proceedings, separately or in the
    aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse effect
    on Quanta’s financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that may potentially subject Quanta to
    concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and
    cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Quanta maintains
    substantially all of its cash investments with what it believes
    to be high credit quality financial institutions. Quanta grants
    credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral,
    to its customers, which include electric power and gas
    companies, telecommunications and cable television system
    operators, governmental entities, general contractors, and
    builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial
    properties located primarily in the United States. Consequently,
    Quanta is subject to potential credit risk related to changes in
    business and economic factors throughout the United States.
    However, Quanta generally has certain statutory lien rights with
    respect to services provided. Under certain circumstances such
    as foreclosures or negotiated settlements, Quanta may take title
    to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of
    receivables. Some of Quanta’s customers have experienced
    significant financial difficulties. These economic conditions
    expose Quanta to increased risk related to collectibility of
    receivables for services Quanta has performed. No customer
    accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable as of
    December 31, 2007 or revenues for the years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007.

Self-Insurance

Quanta is insured for employer’s liability and general
    liability claims, subject to a deductible of $1.0 million
    per occurrence, and for auto liability subject to a deductible
    of $3.0 million per occurrence. Quanta is also insured for
    workers’ compensation claims, subject to a deductible of
    $2.0 million per occurrence. Additionally, Quanta is
    subject to an annual cumulative aggregate liability of up to
    $1.0 million on workers’ compensation claims in excess
    of $2.0 million per occurrence. Quanta also has an employee
    health care benefits plan for employees not subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, which was subject to a
    deductible of $250,000 per claimant per year until
    December 31, 2007. The deductible for employee health care
    benefits was increased to $350,000 per claimant per year
    beginning January 1, 2008.

Effective upon the Merger, InfraSource became insured under
    Quanta’s property and casualty insurance program,
    worker’s compensation, auto, general liability, employee
    benefits, etc. Previously, InfraSource was insured for
    workers’ compensation, general liability and
    employer’s liability, each subject to a deductible of
    $0.75 million per occurrence. InfraSource was also insured
    for auto liability, subject to a deductible of $0.5 million
    per occurrence. InfraSource continued to operate its own health
    plan for employees not subject to collective bargaining
    agreements through December 31, 2007, which was subject to
    a deductible of $150,000 per claimant per year.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported
    and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
    assistance from third-party actuaries. However, insurance
    liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
    factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination
    of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of
    incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety
    program. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical
    trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate. As
    of December 31, 2006 and 2007, the gross amount accrued for
    self-insurance claims totaled $117.2 million and
    $152.0 million, with $73.4 million and
    $110.1 million considered to be long-term and included in
    other non-current liabilities. Related insurance
    recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2006 and 2007
    were $10.7 million and $22.1 million, of which
    $5.0 million and $11.9 million are included in prepaid
    expenses and other current assets and $5.7 million and
    $10.2 million are included in other assets, net.

Quanta’s casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods
    from August 1, 2000 to February 28, 2003 has been
    experiencing financial distress but is currently paying valid
    claims. In the event that this insurer’s financial
    situation further deteriorates, Quanta may be required to pay
    certain obligations that otherwise would have been paid by this
    insurer. Quanta estimates that the total future claim amount
    that this insurer is currently



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

obligated to pay on its behalf for the above mentioned policy
    periods is approximately $4.5 million; however, the
    estimate of the potential range of these future claim amounts is
    between $2.1 million and $7.8 million. The actual
    amounts ultimately paid by Quanta in connection with such
    claims, if any, may vary materially from the above range and
    could be impacted by further claims development and the extent
    to which the insurer could not honor its obligations. Quanta
    continues to monitor the financial situation of this insurer and
    analyze any alternative actions that could be pursued. In any
    event, Quanta does not expect any failure by this insurer to
    honor its obligations to it, or any alternative actions that
    Quanta may pursue, to have a material adverse impact on its
    financial condition; however, the impact could be material to
    Quanta’s consolidated results of operations or cash flow in
    a given period.

Letters
    of Credit

Certain of Quanta’s vendors require letters of credit to
    ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on its
    behalf, such as to beneficiaries under its self-funded insurance
    programs. In addition, from time to time some customers require
    Quanta to post letters of credit to ensure payment to its
    subcontractors and vendors under those contracts and to
    guarantee performance under its contracts. Such letters of
    credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial
    institution. The letter of credit commits the issuer to pay
    specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the
    holder demonstrates that Quanta has failed to perform specified
    actions. If this were to occur, Quanta would be required to
    reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the
    circumstances of such a reimbursement, Quanta may also have to
    record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. Quanta does
    not believe that it is likely that any claims will be made under
    a letter of credit in the foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2007, Quanta had $168.6 million in
    letters of credit outstanding under its credit facility
    primarily to secure obligations under its casualty insurance
    program. These are irrevocable stand-by letters of credit with
    maturities expiring at various times throughout 2008. Upon
    maturity, it is expected that the majority of these letters of
    credit will be renewed for subsequent one-year periods.

Performance
    Bonds

In certain circumstances, Quanta is required to provide
    performance bonds in connection with its contractual
    commitments. Quanta has indemnified the surety for any expenses
    paid out under these performance bonds. As of December 31,
    2007, the total amount of outstanding performance bonds was
    approximately $926.3 million, and the estimated cost to
    complete these bonded projects was approximately
    $234.1 million.

Employment
    Agreements

Quanta has various employment agreements with certain executives
    and other employees, which provide for compensation and certain
    other benefits and for severance payments under certain
    circumstances. Certain employment agreements also contain
    clauses that become effective upon a change of control of
    Quanta. In addition, employment agreements between InfraSource
    and certain of its executives and employees included provisions
    that became effective upon termination of employment within a
    specified time period following the change of control of
    InfraSource. Upon the occurrence of any of the defined events in
    the various employment agreements, Quanta will pay certain
    amounts to the employee, which vary with the level of the
    employee’s responsibility.

Collective
    Bargaining Agreements

Certain of Quanta’s subsidiaries are party to various
    collective bargaining agreements with certain of their
    employees. The agreements require such subsidiaries to pay
    specified wages and provide certain benefits to their union
    employees. These agreements expire at various times and have
    typically been renegotiated and renewed on terms similar to the
    ones contained in the expiring agreements.

Indemnities

Quanta has indemnified various parties against specified
    liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in
    connection with Quanta’s previous acquisitions of certain
    companies. The indemnities under acquisition agreements usually
    are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that
    reach specified thresholds. Quanta also generally indemnifies
    its customers for the services it provides under its contracts,
    as well as other specified liabilities, which may subject Quanta
    to indemnity claims and liabilities and related litigation. As
    of December 31, 2007, Quanta is not aware of circumstances
    that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for
    material amounts in connection with these indemnity obligations.

ITEM 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

There have been no changes in or disagreements with accountants
    on accounting and financial disclosure within the parameters of
    Item 304(b) of

Regulation S-K.

ITEM 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

are certifications of Quanta’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer that are required in accordance with

Rule 13a-14

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
    Act). This “Controls and Procedures” section includes
    information concerning the controls and controls evaluation
    referred to in the certifications, and it should be read in
    conjunction with the certifications for a more complete
    understanding of the topics presented.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management has established and maintains a system of
    disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide
    reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
    by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
    Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC rules and forms. The disclosure controls and procedures are
    also designed to provide reasonable assurance that such
    information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we
    evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to

Rule 13a-15(b)

of the Exchange Act. This evaluation was carried out under the
    supervision and with the participation of our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer. Based on this evaluation, these officers have concluded
    that, as of December 31, 2007, our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance of
    achieving their objectives.

Evaluation
    of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management’s Annual Report on internal control over
    financial reporting can be found in Item 8 of this Annual
    Report under the heading “Report of Management” and is
    incorporated herein by reference. The report of
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, on the financial statements, and its opinion on
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, can also be found in Item 8 of this Annual
    Report under the heading “Report of Independent Registered
    Public Accounting Firm” and is incorporated herein by
    reference.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2007, that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

Design
    and Operation of Control Systems

Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting
    will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control
    system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
    only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control
    system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control
    system must reflect the fact that there are resource
    constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
    relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent
    limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
    can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
    or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances
    of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These
    inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
    decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because
    of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can be circumvented by
    the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
    people, or by management override of the controls. The design of
    any system of



controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the
    likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
    any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
    potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in
    the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
