PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

General

Quanta Services, Inc. (Quanta) is a leading provider of specialty contracting services, offering infrastructure solutions primarily to the
electric power and oil and gas industries in the United States, Canada and Australia and select other international markets. The services we provide include the design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of infrastructure within each of
the industries we serve, such as electric power transmission and distribution networks, substation facilities, renewable energy facilities, pipeline transmission and distribution systems and facilities, and related infrastructure.

We report our results under two reportable segments: (1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services and (2) Oil and Gas Infrastructure
Services. This structure is generally focused on broad

end-user

markets for our services. Our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were approximately $7.65 billion, of which 63%
was attributable to the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment and 37% to the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment.

We
have established a presence throughout the United States, Canada and Australia with a workforce of approximately 28,100 employees as of December 31, 2016, which enables us to quickly and reliably serve a diversified customer base. We believe
our reputation for responsiveness and performance, geographic reach, comprehensive service offering, safety leadership and financial strength have resulted in strong relationships with numerous customers, which include many of the leading companies
in the industries we serve. Our ability to deploy services to customers throughout the United States, Canada and Australia as a result of our broad geographic presence and significant scope and scale of services is particularly important to our
customers who operate networks that span multiple states or regions. We believe these same factors also position us to continue to take advantage of other international opportunities.

Representative customers include:

•    Ameren Corporation

•    ITC Holdings Corp.

•    American Electric Power Company, Inc.

•    Maurepas Pipeline, LLC

•    ATCO Electric

•    Nalcor Energy

•    CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

•    NextEra Energy, Inc.

•    Con Edison Development, Inc.

•    PG&E Corporation

•    Duke Energy Corporation

•    Puget Sound Energy, Inc.

•    Enbridge, Inc.

•    San Diego Gas & Electric Company

•    Entergy Corporation

•    Spectra Energy Corp.

•    Exelon Corporation

•    Southern California Edison Company

•    Eversource Energy

•    Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP

•    FirstEnergy Corporation

•    TransCanada Corporation

We were organized as a corporation in the state of Delaware in 1997, and since that time, we have grown
organically and through strategic acquisitions. This growth has expanded our geographic presence and scope of services and developed new capabilities to meet our customers’ evolving needs.

We believe that our business strategies, along with our competitive and financial strengths, are key elements in differentiating us from our
competition and position us to capitalize on future capital spending by our



Index to Financial Statements

customers. We offer comprehensive and diverse solutions on a broad geographic scale and have a solid base of long-standing customer relationships in each of the industries we serve. We also have
an experienced management team, both at the executive level and within our operating units, and various proprietary technologies that enhance our service offerings. Our strategies of expanding the portfolio of services we provide to our existing and
potential customer base, increasing our geographic and technological capabilities, promoting best practices and cross-selling our services to our customers, as well as continuing to maintain our financial strength, place us in the position to
capitalize on opportunities and trends in the industries we serve and to expand our operations globally to select international markets. We continue to evaluate potential acquisitions of companies with strong management teams and good reputations
and believe that our financial strength and experienced management team are attractive to potential acquisition targets.

On
August 4, 2015, we completed the sale of our fiber optic licensing operations to Crown Castle International Corp. for a purchase price of approximately $1 billion in cash, resulting in

after-tax

net
proceeds of approximately $848 million. In the third quarter of 2015, we recognized a net of tax gain of approximately $171 million. We have presented the results of operations, financial position, cash flows and disclosures of the fiber
optic licensing operations as discontinued operations for all periods in our consolidated financial statements.

Reportable Segments

The following is an overview of the types of services provided by each of our reportable segments.

Electric Power Infrastructure Services Segment

The Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment provides comprehensive network solutions to customers in the electric power industry.
Services performed by the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power transmission and distribution infrastructure and substation facilities along with
other engineering and technical services. This segment also provides emergency restoration services, including the repair of infrastructure damaged by inclement weather, the energized installation, maintenance and upgrade of electric power
infrastructure utilizing unique bare hand and hot stick methods and our proprietary robotic arm technologies, and the installation of “smart grid” technologies on electric power networks. In addition, this segment designs, installs and
maintains renewable energy generation facilities, consisting of solar, wind and certain types of natural gas generation facilities, and related switchyards and transmission infrastructure. To a lesser extent, this segment provides services such as
the construction of electric power generation facilities, the design, the installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, installation of traffic networks and cable and control systems for light rail lines and ancillary
telecommunication infrastructure services.

Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Segment

The Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment provides comprehensive network solutions to customers involved in the development and
transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline products. Services performed by the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design, installation, repair and maintenance of pipeline transmission and distribution
systems, gathering systems, production systems, storage systems and compressor and pump stations, as well as related trenching, directional boring and mechanized welding services. In addition, this segment’s services include pipeline
protection, integrity testing, rehabilitation and replacement, and fabrication of pipeline support systems and related structures and facilities. We also serve the offshore and inland water energy markets, primarily providing services to oil and gas
exploration platforms, including mechanical installation (or

“hook-ups”),

electrical and instrumentation,

pre-commissioning

and commissioning, coatings,
fabrication and marine asset repair. To a lesser extent, this segment designs, installs and maintains fueling systems, as well as water and sewer infrastructure.

Financial Information about Geographic Areas

We operate primarily in the United States; however, we derived $1.59 billion, $1.54 billion and $1.89 billion of our revenues
from foreign operations during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of our foreign revenues, approximately 75%, 85% and 82% were earned in Canada during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. In addition, we held property and equipment in the amount of $320.7 million and $317.6 million in foreign countries, primarily Canada, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Our business, financial condition and results of operations in foreign countries may be adversely impacted by monetary and fiscal policies,
currency fluctuations, regulatory requirements and other political, social and economic developments or instability. Refer to Item 1A.

Customers, Strategic Alliances and Preferred Provider Relationships

Our customers include electric power and oil and gas companies, as well as commercial, industrial and governmental entities. We have a large
and diverse customer base, including many of the leading companies in the industries we serve. Our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 32% of our consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016. Our largest customer
accounted for approximately 4% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Although we have a centralized
marketing and business development strategy, management at each of our operating units is responsible for developing and maintaining successful long-term relationships with customers. Our operating unit management teams build upon existing customer
relationships to secure additional projects and increase revenues from our current customer base. Many of these customer relationships originated decades ago and are maintained through a partnering approach with account management that includes
project evaluation and consulting, quality performance, performance measurement and direct customer contact. Additionally, operating unit management focuses on pursuing growth opportunities with prospective new customers. We encourage operating unit
management to cross-sell services of our other operating units to their customers and to coordinate with our other operating units to pursue projects, especially those that are larger and more complicated. Our business development group supports the
operating units’ activities by promoting and marketing our services for existing and prospective large national accounts, as well as projects that would require services from multiple operating units.

We are a preferred vendor for many of our customers. As a preferred vendor, we have met minimum standards for a specific category of service,
maintained a high level of performance and agreed to certain payment terms and negotiated rates. We strive to maintain preferred vendor status as we believe it provides us an advantage in the award of future work for the applicable customer.

Many of our strategic relationships with customers take the form of strategic alliance or long-term maintenance agreements. Strategic alliance
agreements generally state an intention to work together over a period of time and/or on specific types of projects, and many provide us with preferential bidding procedures. Strategic alliances and long-term maintenance agreements are typically
agreements for an initial term of approximately two to four years and may include renewal options to extend the initial term.

Backlog

Backlog is not a term recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP); however, it is a common measurement
used in our industry. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies.



Index to Financial Statements

Our backlog represents the amount of consolidated revenues that we expect to realize from future
work under construction contracts, long-term maintenance contracts and master service agreements (MSAs). These estimates include revenues from the remaining portion of firm orders not yet completed and on which work has not yet begun, as well as
revenues from change orders, renewal options, and funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent that they are reasonably expected to occur. For purposes of calculating backlog, we include 100% of estimated revenues attributable
to consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities (VIEs). The following table presents our total backlog by reportable segment as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, along with an estimate of the backlog amounts expected to be realized
within 12 months of each balance sheet date (in thousands):

Revenue estimates included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of project accelerations,
cancellations or delays due to various factors, including but not limited to commercial issues, regulatory requirements and adverse weather. These factors can also cause revenue amounts to be realized in periods and at levels different than
originally projected. Generally, our customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services under our MSAs, and most of our contracts may be terminated, typically upon 30 to 90 days’ notice, even if we are not in default
under the contract. We determine the estimated amount of backlog for work under MSAs by using recurring historical trends inherent in current MSAs, factoring in seasonal demand and projected customer needs based upon ongoing communications with the
customer. In addition, many of our MSAs are subject to renewal options. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, MSAs accounted for approximately 42% and 45% of our estimated 12 month backlog and approximately 53% and 50% of total backlog. There can
be no assurance as to our customers’ actual requirements or that our estimates are accurate.

Competition

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete with other contractors in most of the geographic markets in which we
operate, and several of our competitors are large companies that have significant financial, technical and marketing resources. In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into some of the industries in which we operate and, as a result,
any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor. A significant portion of our revenues is currently derived from unit price or fixed price agreements, and price is often an important
factor in the award of such agreements. Accordingly, we could be underbid by our competitors in an effort by them to procure such business. We believe that as demand for our services increases, customers often consider other factors in choosing a
service provider, including technical expertise and experience, financial and operational resources, nationwide presence, industry reputation and dependability, which we expect to benefit larger contractors such as us. In addition, competition may
lessen as industry resources, such as labor supplies, approach capacity. There can be no assurance, however, that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and
quality to our services, or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. We also face competition from the

in-house

service organizations of our existing or prospective customers,
including electric power, oil and gas and engineering companies, which employ personnel who perform some of the same types of services as those provided by us. Although these companies currently outsource a significant portion of these services, in
particular services relating to larger energy transmission infrastructure projects, there can be no assurance that they will continue to do so in the future or that they will not acquire additional in-house capabilities.



Index to Financial Statements

Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 28,100 employees, consisting of approximately 5,200 salaried employees, including executive
officers, professional and administrative staff, project managers and engineers, job superintendents and clerical personnel, and approximately 22,900 hourly employees, the number of which fluctuates depending upon the number and size of the projects
that are ongoing and planned at any particular time. Approximately 58% of our hourly employees at December 31, 2016 were covered by collective bargaining agreements, which require the payment of specified wages to our union employees, the
observance of certain workplace rules and the payment of certain amounts to multiemployer pension plans and employee benefit trusts rather than us sponsoring or administering the benefit programs provided on behalf of our employees. These collective
bargaining agreements have varying terms and expiration dates. The majority of the collective bargaining agreements contain provisions that prohibit work stoppages or strikes, even during specified negotiation periods relating to agreement renewals,
and provide for binding arbitration dispute resolution in the event of prolonged disagreement.

We provide health, welfare and benefit
plans for employees who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. We also have a 401(k) plan pursuant to which eligible employees who are not provided retirement benefits through a collective bargaining agreement may make contributions
through a payroll deduction. We make matching cash contributions of 100% of each employee’s contribution up to 3% of that employee’s salary and 50% of each employee’s contribution between 3% and 6% of such employee’s salary, up
to the maximum amount permitted by law.

Our industry is experiencing a shortage of journeyman linemen in certain geographic areas. In
response to the shortage and to attract qualified employees, we utilize various International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) training programs and support the joint IBEW/NECA
Apprenticeship Program which trains qualified electrical workers. Certain of our Canadian operations also support the Canadian Union Skilled Workers (CUSW)’s apprenticeship programs for training construction and maintenance electricians and
powerline technicians. We have also established apprenticeship training programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor for employees not subject to the IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program, as well as additional company-wide and project-specific
employee training and educational programs.

We believe our relationships with our employees and union representatives are good.

Materials

Our customers typically supply
most or all of the materials required for each job. However, for some of our contracts, we may procure all or part of the materials required. As we continue to expand our comprehensive engineering, procurement and construction offerings, the cost of
materials may become a proportionately larger component of our consolidated cost of services. We do not anticipate experiencing any significant difficulties in procuring such materials as we purchase such materials from a variety of sources.

Training, Quality Assurance and Safety

Performance of our services requires the use of equipment and exposure to hazardous conditions. Although we are committed to a policy of
operating safely and prudently, we have been and will continue to be subject to claims by employees, customers and third parties for property damage and personal injury. In response to these inherent hazards and as part of our commitment to employee
safety, our operating units have established safety programs, policies and procedures requiring that employees complete prescribed training and service programs prior to starting work. Additionally, we have implemented an enterprise-wide Automated
External Defibrillator (AED) program, which provides AEDs to all of our crews and training to enhance life safety response measures. Our operating units performing more sophisticated and technical jobs utilize, when applicable, training programs



Index to Financial Statements

provided by the IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program, the training programs sponsored by the four trade unions administered by the Pipe Line Contractors Association (PLCA), the apprenticeship
training programs sponsored by the CUSW or our equivalent programs. Under the IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program, all journeyman linemen are required to complete a minimum of 7,000 hours of

on-the-job

training, approximately 144 hours of classroom education and extensive testing and certification. Certain of our operating units have established apprenticeship training programs approved by
the U.S. Department of Labor that prescribe equivalent training requirements for employees who are not otherwise subject to the requirements of the IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program. Similarly, the CUSW offers apprenticeship training for
construction and maintenance electricians that requires five terms of 1,700 hours each, combining classroom and

on-the-job

training, as well as training for powerline
technicians that also involves classroom and jobsite training over a four-year period. In addition, the Laborers International Union of North America, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters and
the International Union of Operating Engineers have training programs specifically designed for developing and improving the skills of their members who work in the pipeline construction industry. Our operating units also share best practices for
training and educational programs and safety policies.

During 2016, we expanded the capabilities of our training facility to include
training for beginning linemen, lead and cable splicing and directional drilling in addition to our existing energized electric power and pipeline training. This facility helps us facilitate classroom and

on-the-job

training programs and allows us to train employees in a controlled environment without the challenges of limited structure access and utility constraints.

Regulation

Our operations are subject to
various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations including:

•

licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to contractors, electricians and engineers;

•

regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection;

•

permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects;

•

wage and hour regulations;

•

regulations relating to transportation of equipment and materials, including licensing and permitting requirements;

•

building and electrical codes; and

•

special bidding, procurement and other requirements on government projects.

We believe that
we have all the licenses required to conduct our operations and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our
operating licenses, as well as give rise to termination or cancellation rights under our contracts or disqualify us from future bidding opportunities.

Environmental Matters and Climate Change Impacts

We are committed to the protection of the environment and train our employees to perform their duties accordingly. We are subject to numerous
federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations governing our operations, including the handling, transportation and disposal of

non-hazardous

and hazardous substances and wastes, as
well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous
substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, liability can be imposed for cleanup of previously owned or operated properties or currently owned properties at which hazardous substances or wastes were discharged or
disposed of by a former owner or



Index to Financial Statements

operator, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could
also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or use property as collateral for financing. In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental
laws and regulations or be subject to a revocation of certain licenses or permits, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. Our contracts with customers may also impose liability on us for
environmental issues that arise through the performance of our services.

From time to time, we may incur costs and obligations for
correcting environmental noncompliance matters and for remediation at or relating to certain of our properties. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with our environmental obligations and that any such obligations will not have a
material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.

The potential impact of climate change on our operations is highly
uncertain. Climate change may result in, among other things, changes in rainfall patterns, storm patterns and intensity and temperature levels. As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

including in Item 1A.

Risk Factors

, our operating results are significantly influenced by weather, and significant changes in historical weather patterns could significantly impact our future operating results. For example, if climate
change results in drier weather and more accommodating temperatures over a greater period of time, we may be able to increase our productivity, which could positively impact our revenues and gross margins. Further, if climate change results in an
increase in severe weather, such as hurricanes and ice storms, we could experience a greater amount of higher-margin emergency restoration service work, which generally has a positive impact on our gross margins. Conversely, if climate change
results in a greater amount of rainfall, snow, ice or other less accommodating weather conditions, we could experience reduced productivity, which could negatively impact our revenues and gross margins. Climate change could also have a negative
impact on the demand for fossil fuels, which in turn could negatively impact demand for certain of our services.

Risk Management and Insurance

We are insured for employer’s liability, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability claims. Under these
programs, the deductible for employer’s liability is $1.0 million per occurrence, the deductible for workers’ compensation is $5.0 million per occurrence, and the deductibles for auto liability and general liability are
$10.0 million per occurrence. We are generally self-insured for all claims that do not exceed the amount of the applicable deductible. In connection with our casualty insurance programs, we are required to issue letters of credit to secure our
self-insured obligations. We also have employee health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $0.4 million per claimant per year.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate
of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of
our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate.

We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may change in future periods.
In addition, insurers may cancel our coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or we may elect not to obtain certain types or incremental levels of insurance if we believe that the cost to obtain such coverage exceeds the
additional benefits obtained. In any such event, our overall risk exposure would increase, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Seasonality and Cyclicality

Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced by weather, customer
spending patterns, bidding seasons, receipt of required regulatory approvals, permits and rights of way, project timing and schedules, and holidays. Please read the section entitled

variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. The matters described below are not the only risks and uncertainties facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to
us or not described below also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected, and we may not be able to achieve
our goals or expectations. This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

also includes statements reflecting assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as
“forward-looking statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled

Uncertainty of Forward-Looking Statements and Information

included in Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Our operating results may vary
significantly from quarter to quarter.

Our business can be highly cyclical and subject to seasonal and other variations that can
result in significant differences in operating results from quarter to quarter. For example, we typically experience lower gross and



Index to Financial Statements

operating margins during winter months due to lower demand for our services and more difficult operating conditions in the Northern hemisphere. Additionally, our quarterly results may be
materially and/or adversely affected by:

•

the timing and volume of work we perform;

•

permitting, regulatory or customer-caused delays on projects;

•

adverse weather conditions;

•

variations in the size, scope and margins of projects we perform and the mix of our customers, contracts and business during any particular quarter;

•

increases in construction and design costs;

•

fluctuations in regional, national or global economic and market conditions and demand for our services;

•

pricing pressures resulting from competition;

•

the budgetary spending patterns of customers and federal, state and local governments;

•

disruptions in our customers’ strategic plans which could occur as a result of emerging technologies;

•

the magnitude of work performed under change orders and the timing of their recognition;

•

disputes with customers relating to payment terms under our contracts and change orders, and our ability to successfully negotiate and obtain payment or reimbursement under our contracts and change orders;

•

the outcome or resolution of pending or threatened litigation, claims or other legal proceedings;

•

liabilities associated with multiemployer pension plans in which our employees participate or withdrawals therefrom;

•

significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

changes in accounting pronouncements that require us to account for items differently than historical

pronouncements have;

•

losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance;

•

payment risk associated with the financial condition of our customers, including those customers affected by the volatility of natural gas and oil prices;

•

the termination or expiration of existing agreements;

•

changes in bonding and lien requirements applicable to existing and new agreements;

•

implementation of various information systems, which could temporarily disrupt

day-to-day

operations;

•

the recognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions;

•

the timing and magnitude of costs we incur to support growth internally or through acquisitions or otherwise;

•

the timing and integration of acquisitions and the magnitude of the related acquisition and integration costs; and

•

the timing and significance of potential additional impairments of long-lived assets, equity or other investments, goodwill or other intangible assets.



Index to Financial Statements

Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results
that can be expected for any other quarter or for the entire year.

Negative economic and market conditions, including continued low
oil and natural gas prices, may adversely impact our customers’ future spending as well as payment for our services and, as a result, our operations and growth.

Stagnant or declining economic conditions have adversely impacted the demand for our services in the past and resulted in the delay, reduction
or cancellation of certain projects and may adversely affect us in the future. In addition, economic and market conditions specifically affecting any of the industries we serve could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows. A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve or a prolonged economic downturn or recession, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness
to fund capital expenditures in the future or pay for past services. Consolidation, competition, capital constraints or negative economic conditions in the electric power and oil and gas industries may also result in reduced spending by, or the loss
of, one or more of our customers.

Our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment is exposed to risks associated with the oil and gas
industry. These risks, which are not subject to our control, include the volatility and cyclical nature of natural gas and oil prices and the resulting effect on demand for the services we provide, and a slowdown in the development or discovery of
natural gas and/or oil reserves. Specifically, lower natural gas and oil prices have resulted, and could continue to result, in decreased spending by some of our customers in our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment. Despite some recovery and
stability in natural gas and oil prices since early 2016, capital spending by exploration and production companies and midstream companies has generally declined in the last few years. Any future decline in prices, or perceived risk thereof, may
place downward pressure on capital programs. As a result, our customers may reduce or delay capital spending on larger pipeline projects, gas gathering and compressor systems and related infrastructure, resulting in less demand for our services. If
the profitability of our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment were to decline, our overall financial position, results of operations and cash flows could also be adversely affected. Additionally, declines in natural gas and oil prices, and
the resulting decline in the development of resource plays and oil and natural gas production, can negatively impact our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. For example, the low price of oil has had an adverse impact on the Canadian
economy, which has impacted demand for some of our electric power services in Canada.

Further, many of our customers finance their
projects through the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. During depressed markets, our customers may be unable to access capital markets or otherwise obtain financing for budgeted capital expenditures. A reduction in cash flow or the lack
of availability of debt or equity financing for our customers could result in a reduction in our customers’ spending for our services and may also impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to grow.

A variety of issues
outside of our control, can affect the timing of and our performance on projects, which may result in additional costs to us, reductions or delays in revenues or the payment of liquidated damages.

Our business is dependent in part upon projects that can be cyclical in nature and are subject to risks of delay. The timing of or failure to
obtain contracts, delays in awards of, start dates for or completion of projects and the cancellations of projects can result in significant periodic fluctuations in our business and results of operations.

Many projects involve challenging engineering, permitting, procurement and construction phases that may occur over extended time periods,
sometimes over several years. We may encounter difficulties as a result of delays in design, engineering information or materials provided by the customer or a third party, delays or difficulties in equipment and material delivery, schedule changes,
delays due to our or our customers’ failure to



Index to Financial Statements

timely obtain permits or rights of way or meet other regulatory requirements or permitting conditions, weather-related delays and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, that can
negatively impact our ability to complete the project and in accordance with the original delivery schedule. A failure by us to properly manage and invest in our equipment fleet could also negatively impact project performance and our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Larger projects, in particular, present additional performance risks due to the larger
and more complex work involved. Furthermore, the bidding processes for larger projects can also be longer and more complex, often taking six to nine months. Regulatory and permitting delays on larger projects tend to be more challenging and cause
more uncertainty as to project timing.

In addition, we contract with third-party suppliers and subcontractors to assist us with the
completion of contracts. Any delay or failure by suppliers or by subcontractors in the completion of their portion of the project may result in delays in the overall progress of the project or may cause us to incur additional costs, or both. We also
may encounter project delays due to local opposition, which may include injunctive actions as well as public protests, to the siting of electric power, natural gas or oil transmission lines, solar or wind projects, or other facilities. Delays and
additional costs may be substantial and, in some cases, we may be required to compensate the customer for such delays. We may not be able to recover all of such costs. In certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion by a scheduled
acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels. Failure to meet any of our schedules or performance requirements could also result in additional costs or penalties, including liquidated damages, and such amounts
could exceed expected project profit. In extreme cases, the above-mentioned factors could cause project cancellations, and we may not be able to replace such projects with similar projects or at all. Such delays or cancellations may impact our
reputation or relationships with customers, adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts.

Our customers may change or delay
various elements of a project before or after its commencement, or the design, engineering information, equipment or materials that are to be provided by the customer or other parties may be preliminarily deficient or delivered later than required
by the project schedule, resulting in additional direct or indirect costs. Under these circumstances, we generally negotiate with the customer with respect to the amount of additional time required and the compensation to be paid to us. We are
subject to the risk that we may be unable to obtain, through negotiation, arbitration, litigation or otherwise, adequate amounts to compensate us for the additional work or expenses incurred by us due to the above-mentioned delays and additional
costs, including as a result of customer-requested change orders or failure by the customer to timely meet its obligations. Litigation or arbitration with respect to payment terms under contracts and change orders is generally lengthy and costly and
may adversely affect our relationship with our customers or potential customers, and it is often difficult to predict when and for how much the claims will be resolved. A failure to obtain adequate extensions or compensation for these matters could
require us to record a reduction to amounts of revenues and gross profit recognized in prior periods under the

percentage-of-completion

accounting method. Any such
adjustments could be substantial. We may also be required to invest significant working capital to fund cost overruns while the resolution of claims is pending, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

Our failure to adequately recover on contract change orders or claims brought by us against customers related to
payment terms and costs could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

We
have in the past brought, and may in the future bring, claims against our customers related to, among other things, the payment terms of our contracts and change orders relating to our contracts. These types of claims occur due to, among other
things, customer-caused delays or changes in project scope, both of which may result in additional cost, which may or may not be recovered until the claim is resolved. In some instances, these claims can be the subject of lengthy legal proceedings,
and it is difficult to accurately predict when they will be fully resolved. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.



Index to Financial Statements

Regulatory and environmental requirements affecting any of the industries we serve may lead
to less demand for our services.

Because the vast majority of our revenue is derived from a few industries, the regulatory and
environmental requirements affecting those industries have a material effect on our business, and increased regulatory and environmental requirements in those industries could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows. Customers in the industries we serve also face heightened regulatory and environmental requirements and stringent permitting processes that impact their projects, which can result in delays, reductions and cancellations of some of
their projects. These regulatory factors have resulted in decreased demand for our services in the past, and they may continue to do so in the future, potentially impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our
ability to grow.

Our business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.

Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability is limited by our ability to employ, train and retain the necessary skilled
personnel. We may not be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy. For instance, we may experience shortages of qualified journeyman linemen, who are integral to the
provision of transmission and distribution services under our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. The commencement of new, large-scale infrastructure projects or increased demand for infrastructure improvements, as well as the aging
electric utility workforce, may also further reduce the pool of skilled workers available to us. In addition, in our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment, there is limited availability of experienced supervisors and foremen that can oversee
larger diameter pipe projects. A shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel creates competitive hiring markets and may result in increased labor expenses. Additionally, if we are unable to hire employees with the requisite skills, we may also
be forced to incur significant training expenses. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues or profitability.

Our use of fixed price contracts could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We currently generate some of our revenues under fixed price contracts. We also expect to generate a greater portion of our
revenues under this type of contract in the future as larger projects, such as electric power and pipeline transmission build-outs and utility-scale solar facilities, become a more significant aspect of our business. We assume risks related to
revenue, cost and profitability on fixed-priced contracts. Actual revenues and project costs can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections due to changes in a variety of factors including:

•

unforeseen circumstances not included in our cost estimates or covered by our contract for which we cannot obtain adequate compensation, including concealed or unknown environmental or geological conditions;

•

changes in the cost of equipment, commodities, materials or labor;

•

unanticipated costs or claims due to customer-caused delays, customer failure to provide required materials or equipment, errors in engineering, specifications or designs, project modifications, or contract termination
or suspension and our inability to obtain reimbursement for such costs or recover on such claims;

•

weather conditions;

•

failure to perform and delays in performance by our project owners or their contractors or our suppliers or subcontractors;

•

delays and additional costs associated with obtaining required permits or approvals;



Index to Financial Statements

•

delays and additional costs attributable to challenges and protests of the siting or specifications of certain projects;

•

quality issues, including those requiring rework or replacement;

•

changes in laws or regulations; and

•

general economic conditions and the economic conditions affecting the industries we serve.

These factors, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts may cause actual revenues and gross profits for a project
to differ from what we originally estimated and could result in reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending upon the size of a particular project, these variations could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we may be required to pay liquidated damages under certain of our contracts if we fail to meet schedule or performance requirements, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse
impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our use of

percentage-of-completion

accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits.

As discussed in Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

—

Critical Accounting Policies

and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

, some of our revenues are
recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting, utilizing the

cost-to-cost

method. This accounting method is generally accepted for fixed price contracts and is used because management considers expended costs to be the best
available measure of progress on these contracts. The

percentage-of-completion

accounting practice we use results in the recognition of contract revenues and earnings
ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full
when losses are determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on an ongoing review of contract profitability. Further, a substantial portion of our contracts contain cost and performance
incentives. Penalties are recorded when known or finalized, which generally occurs during the latter stages of the contract. In addition, we record cost recovery claims when we believe recovery is probable and the amounts can be reasonably
estimated. Actual collection of claims could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant.

Our revenues may be exposed to potential risk if a project is terminated or canceled, if our customers encounter financial difficulties
or if we encounter disputes with our customers.

Our contracts often require us to satisfy or achieve certain milestones in order
to receive payment for the work performed, or in the case of cost-reimbursable contracts, provide support for billings in advance of receiving payment. As a result, we may incur significant costs or perform significant amounts of work prior to
receipt of payment. If any of our customers do not proceed with the completion of projects or default on their payment obligations, or if we encounter disputes with our customers with respect to the adequacy of billing support, we may face
difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred. In addition, many of our customers for large projects are project-specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the
project and may encounter financial difficulties relating to their businesses. It may be difficult to collect amounts owed to us by these customers. If we are unable to collect amounts owed to us, this would have an adverse effect on our future
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We have in the past brought, and may in the future bring, claims against our
customers related to, among other things, the payment terms of our contracts and change orders relating to our contracts. These types of



Index to Financial Statements

claims occur due to, among other things, customer-caused delays or changes in project scope, both of which may result in additional cost, which may or may not be recovered until the claim is
resolved. In some instances, these claims can be the subject of lengthy legal proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when they will be fully resolved. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a negative
impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, any such claims may harm our future relationships with our customers.

Our operating results can be negatively affected by weather conditions and the nature of our work environment.

We perform substantially all of our services outdoors. As a result, adverse weather conditions, such as extreme heat or cold, rainfall,
snowfall, wind, storms or early thaw, may affect our productivity or may temporarily prevent us from performing services. The effect of weather delays on projects that are under fixed price arrangements may be greater if we are unable to adjust the
project schedule for such delays. Furthermore, our work is performed under a variety of conditions, including but not limited to, difficult terrain, difficult site conditions and large urban centers where delivery of materials and availability of
labor may be impacted and sites which may have been exposed to harsh and hazardous conditions. A reduction in our productivity and efficiency in any given period or our inability to meet guaranteed schedules may adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth.

Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to:

•

expand the range of services we offer to customers to address their evolving infrastructure needs;

•

attract new customers;

•

increase the number of projects performed for existing customers;

•

hire and retain qualified employees;

•

expand geographically, including internationally; and

•

address the challenges presented by stringent regulatory, environmental and permitting requirements and difficult economic or market conditions that may affect us or our customers.

In addition, our customers may cancel, delay or reduce the number or size of projects available to us for a variety of reasons, including
capital constraints or inability to meet regulatory requirements. Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth are beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies for achieving internal growth will be
successful.

Our business is highly competitive, and competitive pressures can affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

The specialty contracting business is served by numerous small, owner-operated private companies, some
public companies and several large regional companies. Relatively few barriers prevent entry into some areas of our business, and as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become one of
our competitors.

In addition, some of our competitors have significant financial, technical and marketing resources. We cannot be certain
that our competitors do not have or will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance
our competitive position within the specialty contracting business or maintain our current customer base. Certain of our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures, and



Index to Financial Statements

therefore may be able to provide the required services at lower rates than us. We also face competition from

in-house

service organizations of our existing
or prospective customers. Electric power and oil and gas service providers are capable of performing, or acquiring businesses that perform, some of the same types of services we provide, and we cannot be certain that our existing or prospective
customers will continue to outsource these services in the future.

Furthermore, a substantial portion of our revenues is directly or
indirectly dependent on winning new contracts. The timing of when project awards will be made is unpredictable and often involves complex and lengthy negotiations and bidding processes. These processes can be impacted by a wide variety of factors,
including price, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, commodity prices, environmental conditions and overall market and economic conditions. The competitive environment we operate in can also affect the timing of contract awards and the
commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts. For example, based on rapidly changing competition dynamics, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, more competitive pricing in certain markets, such as the smaller scale
transmission and distribution electric power market. Our bids also may not be successful due to, among other things, a potential customer’s perception of our ability to perform the work or the technological advantages held by our competitors.
Additionally, changing competitive pressures can present difficulties in matching workforce size with available contract awards. As a result, the competitive environment we operate in could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows and could cause our results of operations and cash flows to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.

Changes in government spending and legislative actions and initiatives relating to renewable energy and electric power may adversely
affect demand for our services.

Demand for our services may not result from renewable energy initiatives. While many states
currently have mandates in place that require specified percentages of power to be generated from renewable sources, those mandates could be reduced or made optional, thereby reducing, delaying or eliminating renewable energy development.
Additionally, renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce than energy from traditional sources and may require additional power generation sources as backup. The locations of renewable energy projects are often remote and are not viable
unless new or expanded transmission infrastructure to transport the power to demand centers is economically feasible. Furthermore, funding for renewable energy initiatives is uncertain and in the past has been constrained by tight credit markets.
These factors could result in fewer renewable energy projects than anticipated and a delay in the construction of these projects and related infrastructure, which could negatively impact our business.

Other current and potential legislative or regulatory initiatives may not result in increased demand for our services. Examples include
legislation or regulations that require utilities to meet reliability standards, ease siting and

right-of-way

issues for the construction of transmission lines, and
encourage installation of new electric power transmission and renewable energy generation facilities. It is not certain whether existing legislation will create sufficient incentives for new projects, when or if proposed legislative initiatives will
be enacted or whether any potentially beneficial provisions will be included in the final legislation.

There are also a number of
legislative and regulatory proposals and global,

non-binding

agreements that address greenhouse gas emissions, which are in various phases of discussion or implementation. The outcome of these pending federal
and state proposals and possible future legislative and regulatory proposals resulting from any global agreement could negatively affect the operations of our customers through costs of compliance or restraints on projects, which could reduce their
demand for our services.

Our business is subject to operational hazards, and we are self-insured against certain potential
liabilities.

Our business is subject to significant operational hazards due to the nature of services provided by our workforce
and the conditions in which they operate. These hazards include those involving electricity, fires, natural gas explosions, mechanical failures and weather-related incidents. Our offshore operations are subject to



Index to Financial Statements

additional risks, including blowouts, collisions, vessels sinking or capsizing and damage from severe weather conditions. These hazards could cause personal injury and severe damage to property,
equipment and the environment and could lead to suspension of operations and/or legal liabilities. We also often operate in densely populated urban areas, which could increase the impact of any of these hazards or other accidents we experience. If
we are not fully insured or indemnified against such liabilities or a counterparty fails to meet its indemnification obligations to us, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Further, any such liabilities or accidents could adversely affect our safety record, which could impact our ability to bid on certain work.

We are insured for employer’s liability, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability claims, but such insurance is
subject to deductibles and limits and may be canceled or may not cover all of our losses. Under these programs, the deductible for employer’s liability is $1.0 million per occurrence, the deductible for workers’ compensation is
$5.0 million per occurrence, and the deductibles for auto liability and general liability are $10.0 million per occurrence. We are generally self-insured for all claims that do not exceed the amount of the applicable deductible. In
connection with our casualty insurance programs, we are required to issue letters of credit to secure our self-insured obligations. We also have employee health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements,
of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $0.4 million per claimant per year. Our insurance policies include various coverage requirements, including the requirement to give appropriate notice. If we fail to comply with these
requirements, our coverage could be denied.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimate of the
ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity
of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are
adequate. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs significantly above our estimates, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

During the ordinary course of our business, we may become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims, which could materially and adversely
affect our business and results of operations.

We have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a defendant in
lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers’ compensation, employment discrimination and other
employment-related damages, breach of contract, property damage, environmental liabilities, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, punitive damages, and civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, we
generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts, and, in some instances, we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for actions by our customers or other third parties.
Because our services in certain instances may be integral to the operation and performance of our customers’ infrastructure, we have been and may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems that we work on, even if our
services are not the cause of such failures, and we could be subject to civil and criminal liabilities to the extent that our services contributed to any property damage, personal injury or system failure. Insurance coverage may not be available or
may be insufficient for these lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings. The outcome of any of these lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of management’s attention from our business. Payments of
significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For details on our existing litigation and claims, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.



Index to Financial Statements

Unavailability or cancellation of third party insurance coverage would increase our overall
risk exposure as well as disrupt our operations.

We maintain insurance coverage from third party insurers as part of our overall
risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits. There can be no assurance that our insurance coverages will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all
claims and liabilities which we may be subject. Additionally, we renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore deductibles and levels of coverage may change in future periods. There can be no assurance that any of our existing
insurance coverage will be renewed upon the expiration of the coverage period or that future coverage will be affordable at the required limits. In addition, our third party insurers could fail, suddenly cancel our coverage or otherwise be unable to
provide us with adequate insurance coverage. If any of these events occur, our overall risk exposure would increase and our operations could be disrupted. For example, we have significant operations in California and other locations which have a
higher risk of wildfires. Should our insurers determine to exclude coverage for wildfires in the future, we could be exposed to significant liabilities and a potential disruption of our operations. If our risk exposure increases as a result of
adverse changes in our insurance coverage, we could be subject to increased claims and liabilities that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Many of our contracts may be canceled or suspended on short notice or may not be renewed upon completion or expiration, and we may be
unsuccessful in replacing our contracts in such events, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We could experience a decrease in our revenues, net income and liquidity if any of the following occur:

•

our customers cancel or suspend a significant number of contracts or contracts having significant value;

•

we fail to renew a significant number of our existing contracts;

•

we complete a significant number of

non-recurring

projects and cannot replace them with similar projects; or

•

we fail to reduce operating and overhead expenses consistent with any decrease in our revenues.

Many of our customers may cancel or suspend our contracts on short notice, typically 30 to 90 days, even if we are not in default under
the contract. Certain of our customers assign work to us on a

project-by-project

basis under master service agreements. Under these agreements, our customers generally
have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us. Our operations could decline significantly if the anticipated volume of work is not assigned to us, which will be more likely if customer spending decreases due to, for example,
unfavorable economic conditions. Many of our contracts, including our master service agreements, are opened to public bid at the expiration of their terms. There can be no assurance that we will be the successful bidder on our existing contracts
that are subject to

re-bid

in the future.

The nature of our business exposes us to
potential liability for warranty claims and faulty engineering, which may reduce our profitability.

Under our contracts with
customers, we typically provide warranties for the services and materials we provide, guaranteeing the work performed against, among other things, defects in workmanship. The majority of our contracts have a warranty period of 18 to 24 months,
although some are longer. As much of the work we perform is inspected by our customers for any defects in construction prior to acceptance of the project, the warranty claims that we have historically received have not been substantial.
Additionally, materials used in construction are often provided by the customer or are warranted against defects by the supplier. However, certain projects may have longer warranty periods and include facility performance warranties that may be
broader than the warranties we generally provide. In these circumstances, if warranty claims occur, we are generally required to

re-perform

the services and/or repair or replace the warranted item and any
other facilities



Index to Financial Statements

impacted thereby, at our sole expense, and we could also be responsible for other damages if we are not able to adequately satisfy our warranty obligations. In addition, we may be required under
contractual arrangements with our customers to warrant any defects or failures in materials we provide. While we generally require the materials suppliers to provide us warranties that are consistent with those we provide to our customers, if any of
these suppliers default on their warranty obligations to us, we may incur costs to repair or replace the defective materials. Costs incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

Furthermore, because our projects are often technically complex, our failure to make judgments and
recommendations in accordance with applicable professional standards, including engineering standards, could result in damages. Our business involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and
management of electric power transmission and pipeline infrastructure. While we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages, and although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to
reduce potential liabilities, a significantly adverse or catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability or other claims
against us as well as reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. These liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. In addition, customers, subcontractors or suppliers
who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. An uninsured claim, either in part or in whole, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a substantial impact on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The loss of one or a few customers could have a material adverse effect
on us.

A few customers have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenues in any one year or
over a period of several consecutive years. Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant customers, our customers may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their contracts with us at any time. The loss of business from a
significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Backlog may not be realized or may not result in profits.

Backlog is not a term recognized under US GAAP; however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. Our methodology for determining
backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies. For a discussion of how we calculate backlog for our business, please see

Backlog

in Item 1.

Business

.

Furthermore, backlog is difficult to determine with certainty. Customers often have no obligation under our contracts to assign or release
work to us, and many contracts may be terminated on short notice. Reductions in backlog due to cancellation or reduction in scope of one or more contracts or projects by a customer or for other reasons could significantly reduce the revenues and
profit we actually receive from contracts included in backlog. In the event of a project cancellation or reduction in scope, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but would not have a contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our
backlog. The backlog we obtain in connection with companies we acquire may not be as large as we believed and may not result in the revenues or profits we expected at the time of acquisition. In addition, projects that are delayed may remain in
backlog for extended periods of time. All of these uncertainties are heightened by negative economic conditions and their impact on our customers’ spending, as well as the effects of regulatory requirements and weather conditions. Consequently,
our estimates of backlog may not be accurate, and we may not be able to realize our estimated backlog.

Our financial results are
based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.

In preparing our consolidated financial statements in
conformity with US GAAP, several estimates and assumptions are used by management to report the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recognized during



Index to Financial Statements

the periods presented and to determine the contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are necessary because
certain information used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted
methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates are used primarily in our assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful
lives of assets, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill, other intangibles and long-lived asset impairments, equity and other investments, loan receivables, purchase price allocations, liabilities for self-insured and other claims and
guarantees, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, revenue recognition for construction contracts inclusive of contractual change orders and claims, share-based compensation, operating results of reportable segments, provision (benefit)
for income taxes and the calculation of uncertain tax positions. Actual results for all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows.

Our inability to successfully execute our acquisition strategy may have an adverse impact on our
growth strategy.

Our business strategy includes expanding our presence in the industries we serve through strategic acquisitions
of companies that complement or enhance our business. The number of acquisition targets that meet our criteria may be limited. We may also face competition for acquisition opportunities, and other potential acquirers may offer more favorable terms
or have greater financial resources available for potential acquisitions. This competition may further limit our acquisition opportunities and our ability to grow through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions and make them less
accretive, or possibly not accretive, to us. Failure to consummate future acquisitions could negatively affect our growth strategies. Additionally, the acquisitions we complete may involve significant cash expenditures, the incurrence or assumption
of debt or burdensome regulatory requirements, and any acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We may be unsuccessful at integrating businesses that either we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future, which may reduce the
anticipated benefit from acquired businesses.

As a part of our business strategy, we have acquired, and may seek to acquire in the
future, companies that complement or enhance our business. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquired businesses, such as the expansion of our existing operations, elimination of
redundant costs and capitalizing on cross-selling opportunities. To realize these benefits, however, we must successfully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our existing operations. Integrating our acquired companies involves a
number of special risks, including:

•

failure of acquired companies to achieve the results we expect;

•

diversion of our management’s attention from operational and other matters;

•

difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies;

•

additional financial reporting and accounting challenges associated with integrating acquired companies;

•

inability to retain key personnel of acquired companies;

•

risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities;

•

loss of business due to customer overlap, change from local or private ownership or other factors;

•

risks and liabilities arising from the prior operations of acquired companies, such as performance, operational, safety, workforce or tax issues, some of which we may not have discovered during our due diligence and may
not be covered by indemnification obligations; and

•

potential disruptions of our business.



Index to Financial Statements

We cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully complete the integration process without
substantial costs, delays, disruptions or other operational or financial problems. If we do not implement proper overall business controls, our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent operating and financial practices at the
companies we acquire. Additionally, failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of asset impairments.

When we acquire a business, we record an asset called “goodwill” equal to the excess amount we pay for the business, including
liabilities assumed, over the fair value of the tangible and other intangible assets of the business we acquire. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives cannot be amortized, but instead must be tested at least annually
for impairment, while intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives. The accounting literature provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other

non-amortized

intangible assets for impairment. Refer to Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

—

Critical Accounting Policies

for a detailed
discussion. Management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions when allocating goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of a reporting unit’s net assets and liabilities, including, among other things, an
assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, cost of capital and growth rates, which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair value is determined using a combination of
the discounted cash flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches. Absent any impairment indicators, we perform our impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter. If market capitalization declines below book value, this
may be considered an impairment indicator.

As part of our 2015 annual test for goodwill impairment, we recorded a

non-cash

impairment charge of $39.8 million related to goodwill and $12.1 million related to customer relationships, trade names and

non-compete

agreement intangible
assets. The extended low commodity price environment significantly impacted certain reporting units within our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division. Specifically, lower levels of expected activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and, to a lesser
extent, with respect to certain directional drilling operations in Australia resulted in impairments of goodwill and intangible assets. Any future impairments, including impairments of goodwill, intangible assets or investments, could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recognized.

We
also recorded asset impairments primarily related to certain international renewable energy services operations of $8.0 million in 2016 and $6.6 million in 2015. The 2016 impairment was primarily due to a pending disposition of certain
international renewable energy services operations, and the 2015 impairment was based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows for the asset group as compared to their carrying value.

In addition, we enter into various types of investment arrangements in the normal course of business, each having unique terms and conditions.
These investments may include equity interests we hold in business entities, including general or limited partnerships, contractual joint ventures or other forms of equity or profit participation. These investments may also include our participation
in different finance structures such as the extension of loans to project specific entities, the acquisition of convertible notes issued by project specific entities or other strategic financing arrangements. Our equity method investments are
carried at original cost and are included in other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheet and are adjusted for our proportionate share of the investees’ income, losses and distributions. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment by
assessing whether there has been a decline in the fair value of the investment below the carrying value and whether that decline is considered to be other than temporary. In making this determination, factors such as the ability to recover the
carrying amount of the investment and the inability of the investee to sustain future earnings capacity are evaluated in determining whether an impairment has occurred and should be recognized.



Index to Financial Statements

We extend credit to customers for purchases of our services and may enter into longer-term
deferred payment arrangements or provide other financing or investment arrangements with certain of our customers, which subjects us to potential credit or investment risk that could, if realized, adversely affect our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

We grant credit, generally without collateral, to our customers, which include electric power
utilities, oil and gas companies, governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of renewable energy facilities and commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the United States, Canada and Australia. We
may also agree to allow our customers to defer payment on projects until certain milestones have been met or until the projects are substantially completed, and customers typically withhold some portion of amounts due to us as retainage. In
addition, we may provide other forms of financing to our customers or make investments in our customers’ projects, typically in situations where we also provide services in connection with the projects. Our payment arrangements subject us to
potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors affecting our customers, including material changes in our customers’ revenues or cash flows. These changes may also reduce the value of any financing or equity
investment arrangements we have with our customers. Many of our customers have been negatively impacted by uncertain economic conditions in recent years, and some may experience financial difficulties (including bankruptcies) that could impact our
ability to collect amounts owed to us or impair the value of our investments in them.

If we are unable to collect amounts owed to us, our
cash flows would be reduced, and we could experience losses if those amounts exceeded current allowances. We would also recognize losses with respect to any investments that are impaired as a result of our customers’ financial difficulties. The
risk of loss may increase for projects where we provide services and make a financing or equity investment. Losses experienced could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The loss of key personnel could disrupt our business.

We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management, including the management at each of our operating units.
Although we typically enter into employment agreements with terms of one to three years with our executive officers and certain other key employees, we cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of
time or that key employees of our future acquisition targets will be willing to enter into such agreements. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our
business.

We may be required to contribute cash to meet our underfunded obligations in certain multiemployer pension plans.

Our collective bargaining agreements generally require us to participate with other companies in multiemployer pension plans. To
the extent those plans are underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, may subject us to substantial liabilities under those plans if we withdraw from them or
they are terminated or experience a mass withdrawal. For example, we are involved in several litigation matters associated with our withdrawal from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (the Central States Plan). The
ultimate liability associated with these matters will depend on various factors, including interpretations of the terms of the collective bargaining agreements under which the subsidiaries participated and whether exemptions from withdrawal
liability applicable to construction industry employers will be available. For additional information on the Central States Plan matters, please see

Collective Bargaining Agreements

in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

.

In addition, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 added special funding and
operational rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multiemployer plans that are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status based on multiple factors (including,
for example, the plan’s funded



Index to Financial Statements

percentage, cash flow position and whether it is projected to experience a minimum funding deficiency). Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a
funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, as applicable, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. Certain plans to which
we contribute or may contribute in the future are in “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status. The amount of additional funds, if any, that we may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future
cannot be estimated due to uncertainty of the future levels of work that require the specific use of union employees covered by these plans, as well as the future contribution levels and possible surcharges on contributions applicable to these
plans.

Our unionized workforce and related obligations could adversely affect our operations.

As of December 31, 2016, approximately 58% of our hourly employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Although the majority
of the collective bargaining agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages, certain of our unionized employees have participated in strikes and work stoppages in the past, and we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur in
the future. Strikes or work stoppages can adversely impact relationships with our customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease our revenue.

Our ability to complete future acquisitions could be adversely affected because of our union status for a variety of reasons. For instance,
our union agreements may be incompatible with the union agreements of a business we want to acquire, and some businesses may not want to become affiliated with a union-based company. Additionally, we may increase our exposure to withdrawal
liabilities for underfunded multiemployer pension plans to which an acquired company historically contributed or presently contributes.

Approximately 42% of our hourly employees are not unionized. In addition, certain of our customers require or prefer a

non-union

workforce, and they may reduce the amount of work assigned to us if our

non-union

labor crews become unionized, which could negatively affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational impacts
relating to occupational health and safety matters.

Our operations are inherently dangerous and subject to extensive laws and
regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace. While we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial resources in our occupational health and safety programs, our industry involves a high degree of
operational risk and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability exposure. Although we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions, we have suffered fatalities in the past and may suffer additional fatalities in the
future. Serious accidents, including fatalities, may subject us to substantial penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Claims for damages to persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in substantial costs
and liabilities. In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time or we were to suffer substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations, our customers could cancel our
contracts and elect to procure future services from other providers. Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the costs of projects for our clients, and raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could
result in financial loss, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Risks associated with operating in international markets could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business and
prospects.

Although our international operations are presently conducted primarily in Canada and Australia, we also perform work
in other foreign countries and expect that the number of countries in which we operate and the



Index to Financial Statements

amount of work we perform in foreign countries could increase over the next few years. Economic conditions, including those resulting from wars, civil unrest, acts of terrorism and other
conflicts or volatility in global markets, may adversely affect our customers, their demand for our services and their ability to pay for our services. In addition, our international operations include business and transactions for which we are paid
in local currency. Payments to us in currencies other than the U.S. dollar may exceed our local currency needs, leading to the accumulation of excess local currency, which, in certain instances, may be subject to temporary blocking, costly taxes or
tariffs, or other difficulties if we attempt to convert those amounts to U.S. dollars.

There are also numerous other risks inherent in
conducting business internationally, including, but not limited to, potential instability in international markets, changes in applicable regulatory requirements, foreign currency fluctuations, political, economic and social conditions in foreign
countries, expropriation or nationalization of our assets, foreign legal systems and cultural practices dissimilar from those we are familiar with, and complex U.S. and foreign tax regulations and other laws and international treaties. These
risks could restrict our ability to provide services to international customers, operate our international business profitably or fund our strategic objectives, and our overall business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
could be negatively impacted by our foreign activities.

Compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our
performance.

We are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes
(excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws, treaties and regulations and changes in existing tax laws, treaties and regulations are
continuously being enacted or proposed, and could result in a higher tax rate on our earnings, which could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities, and our tax estimates and
tax positions could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of
earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. A significant increase in our tax rate could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and liquidity.

We could be adversely affected by our failure to comply with the laws applicable to our foreign activities, including the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act and other similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and
similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions prohibit U.S.-based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to

non-U.S. officials

for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
business. We pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption, and in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our policies mandate compliance
with all applicable anti-bribery laws. Further, we require our partners, subcontractors, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf to comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws. Although we have policies and procedures designed to
ensure that we, our employees, our agents and others who work with us in foreign countries comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will protect us against liability under the FCPA or
other laws for actions taken by our agents, employees and intermediaries. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts or inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could be subject to severe
criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged
FCPA violations is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management.

On March 10, 2014, the SEC
notified us of an inquiry into certain aspects of our activities in certain foreign jurisdictions and requested that we take necessary steps to preserve and retain categories of relevant documents,



Index to Financial Statements

including those pertaining to our FCPA compliance program. The SEC did not allege any violations of law by Quanta or our employees. On October 27, 2016, the SEC notified us that it had
concluded its investigation and, based on the information received, did not intend to pursue further action in connection with this inquiry.

Our participation in joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners.

As part of our business, we have entered into joint venture arrangements and may enter into additional joint venture arrangements in the
future. The purpose of these joint ventures is typically to combine skills and resources to allow for the bidding and performance of particular projects. Success on these jointly performed projects depends in large part on whether our joint venture
partners, over whom we may have little or no control, satisfy their contractual obligations. Differences in opinions or views between us and our joint venture partners can result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material issues that
could adversely affect the business and operations of our joint ventures. Additionally, the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business.

We and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures. If a
joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from claims or lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments,
provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner’s shortfall. Further, if we are unable to adequately address our partner’s performance issues, the customer may terminate the
project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm our reputation and reduce our profit or increase our loss on a project.

We are in the process of implementing information technology (IT) solutions, which could temporarily disrupt

day-to-day

operations at certain operating units.

We
continue to implement comprehensive IT solutions that we believe will allow for the interface between functions such as accounting and finance, human resources, operations, and fleet management. Continued development and implementation of the IT
solutions will require substantial financial and personnel resources. While the IT solutions are intended to improve and enhance our information systems, implementation of new information systems at each operating unit exposes us to the risks of

start-up

of the new system and integration of that system with our existing systems and processes, including possible disruption of our financial reporting. There is no guarantee that we will realize economic or
other intended benefits from continued development and implementation of the IT solutions. Additionally, the IT solutions may not be developed or implemented as timely or as accurately as planned. Failure to properly implement the IT solutions could
result in substantial disruptions to our business, including coordinating and processing our normal business activities, testing and recording of certain data necessary to provide oversight over our disclosure controls and procedures and effective
internal controls over our financial reporting, and other unforeseen problems.

Our failure to adequately protect critical data,
sensitive information and technology systems could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or result in harm to our reputation.

We use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We rely heavily on computer, information, and communications
technology and related systems to manage our operations and other business processes and to protect sensitive company information. Furthermore, in connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable and other sensitive
information of our customers, stockholders and employees, all of which expect that we will adequately protect such information.

Cyber-attacks and physical security risks, such as storms or other natural phenomena, IT solution failures, network disruptions, theft and
other breaches of data security, could disrupt our operations by causing, among



Index to Financial Statements

other things, delays in the processing of transactions or the reporting of financial results or the unintentional disclosure of company information (including confidential or proprietary
information). Cyber-attacks or acts of terrorism against us, our customers and/or our vendors or other breaches of our data security could also cause service disruption or loss of control of our customers’ energy infrastructure systems, which
could subject us to significant liabilities and cause damage to our reputation. Additionally, a significant theft, loss, misappropriation, or inadvertent release of customer, stockholder or employee data by cyber-attack or otherwise could adversely
impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation.

While management has taken steps to address these
concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that the above events will not occur, and such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

Our dependence on suppliers, subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could expose us to risk of loss in our
operations.

On certain projects, we rely on suppliers to obtain the necessary materials and subcontractors to perform portions of
our services. We also rely on equipment manufacturers to provide us with the equipment required to conduct our operations. Although we are not dependent on any single supplier, subcontractor or equipment manufacturer, any substantial limitation on
the availability of required suppliers, subcontractors or equipment manufacturers could negatively impact our operations. The risk of a lack of available suppliers, subcontractors or equipment manufacturers may be heightened as a result of market
and economic conditions. To the extent we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials, our operations could be negatively impacted. Additionally, successful completion of our contracts may depend on whether our subcontractors
successfully fulfill their contractual obligations. If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties, or if our subcontractors fail to meet the expected completion dates or quality
standards, we may be required to incur additional costs or provide additional services in order to make up such shortfall.

An
increase in the prices of certain materials used in our business could adversely affect our business.

For certain contracts, we
are exposed to market risk of increases in certain commodity prices of materials, such as copper and steel, which are used as components of supplies or materials utilized in all of our operations. We are also exposed to increases in energy prices,
particularly as they relate to gasoline prices for our rolling-stock fleet of approximately forty thousand units. While we believe we can increase our prices to adjust for some price increases in commodities, there can be no assurance that price
increases of commodities, if they were to occur, would be recoverable. Additionally, some of our fixed price contracts do not allow us to adjust our prices and, as a result, increases in material or fuel costs could reduce our profitability with
respect to such projects.

We may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth and operations.

If we cannot secure future funds or financing on acceptable terms, we may be unable to support our future operations or growth
strategy. We use cash for acquisitions and other investments, both of which are elements of our growth strategy, and the timing and size of our acquisition or investment efforts cannot be readily predicted. Acquisitions and investments funded by
cash on hand, cash from operations and cash from our current credit facility limit our financial flexibility and may increase our need to seek capital through additional debt or equity financings. We also rely on financing companies to fund the
leasing of certain of our trucks and trailers, support vehicles and specialty construction equipment. Credit market conditions may cause certain of these financing companies to restrict or withhold access to capital for us to fund the leasing of
additional equipment. Although we are not dependent on any single equipment lessor, a widespread lack of available capital to fund the leasing of equipment could negatively impact our future operations.

Our credit agreement contains significant restrictions, including financial covenants and other restrictions on our ability to borrow amounts
under the agreement and limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or



Index to Financial Statements

conduct certain types of preferred equity financings. Our ability to increase the current commitments under our credit facility is also dependent upon additional commitments from our lenders.
Furthermore, if we are permitted under our credit facility to seek additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain they will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, as banks are often restrictive in their lending practices, and
additional debt financing may include covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we are unable to borrow under our current credit agreement or secure other financing or if our lenders become unable or unwilling to
fund their commitments to us, we may not be able to access the capital needed to fund our growth and operations. For additional information on the terms of our credit facility, please read Item 7.

Credit Facility.

Additionally, the market price of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control,
which will impact our ability to use equity to obtain funds. A variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including overall market conditions or volatility, a shortfall in our operating results from
those anticipated, negative results or other unfavorable information relating to our market peers or the other risks described in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our financial results as we expand into international markets.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, we derived $1.59 billion, or 20.8%, of our consolidated revenues from foreign
operations, the substantial majority of which was earned in Canada and Australia. The functional currencies for our foreign operations are typically the currency of the country in which the foreign operating unit is located. Accordingly, our
financial performance is subject to fluctuation due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. As the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, our translation of foreign currency denominated revenues or
expenses will result in lower U.S. dollar denominated revenues and expenses. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses will result in increased U.S.
dollar denominated revenues and expenses. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2016, foreign revenues decreased by approximately $41 million in comparison with the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of less favorable
foreign currency exchange rates due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Canadian dollar. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2015, foreign revenues decreased by approximately $227 million in comparison with the year ended
December 31, 2014 as a result of less favorable foreign currency exchange rates due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Canadian and Australian dollars.

We intend to expand the volume of services that we provide internationally. As a result, our reported financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows may be further exposed to the effects that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations and the remeasurement of transactions which are not
denominated in the reporting units’ functional currencies.

Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk,
which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.

Borrowings under our credit facility and certain other
borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net
income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Our weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 2.1%. The annual effect on our
pretax earnings of a hypothetical 50 basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates would be approximately $1.8 million based on our December 31, 2016 balance of variable rate debt.



Index to Financial Statements

Our business growth could outpace the capability of our decentralized management
infrastructure.

We cannot be certain that our management infrastructure will be adequate to support our operations as they
expand. For example, the ability to internally communicate, coordinate and execute business strategies, plans and tactics may be negatively impacted by our increasing size and complexity. A decentralized structure places significant control and
decision-making powers in the hands of our operating unit management. This contributes to the risk that we may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting key business matters than we would in a more centralized environment.
The lack of timely access to information may impact the quality of decision making by management. Our decentralized organization creates the possibility that our operating subsidiaries assume excessive risk without appropriate guidance from our
centralized legal, accounting, tax, treasury and insurance functions as to the potential overall impact. Future growth could also impose significant additional responsibilities on members of our senior management, including the need to recruit and
integrate new senior level managers and executives. We cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit and retain such additional managers and executives. To the extent that we are unable to manage our growth effectively, or are unable to attract
and retain additional qualified management, we may not be able to expand our operations or execute our business plan.

We may be
unable to compete for or work on certain projects if we are not able to obtain surety bonds, letters of credit or bank guarantees.

A portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other financial assurances.
Current or future market conditions, including losses incurred in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate bankruptcies, as well as changes in our sureties’ assessment of our operating and financial risk, could cause our
surety providers and lenders to decline to issue or renew, or substantially reduce the amount of, bid or performance bonds for our work and could increase our costs associated with collateral. These actions could be taken on short notice. If our
surety providers or lenders were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding, letters of credit or guarantees, our alternatives would include seeking capacity from other sureties and lenders or finding more business that does not require bonds or
that allows for other forms of collateral for project performance, such as cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all, which could affect our ability to bid for or work on future projects
requiring financial assurances.

We have also granted security interests in certain assets to collateralize our obligations to our
sureties and lenders. Furthermore, under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a

project-by-project

basis and can decline to issue
bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing bonds. If we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or other reasons, we
may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects that require bonding.

Our failure to comply with environmental laws could
result in significant liabilities.

Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including those
dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products, PCBs, fuel storage and air quality. We perform work in many different types of underground environments. If the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate, or if objects are present
in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps, our underground work could strike objects in the soil, some of which may contain pollutants. These objects may also rupture, resulting in the discharge of pollutants. In such
circumstances, we may be liable for fines and damages, and we may be unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect information. We perform work in and around environmentally sensitive areas such as rivers, lakes and
wetlands. In addition, we perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies. Due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies, it is possible that such directional drilling may
cause a surface fracture, resulting in the release of subsurface materials. These subsurface materials may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law, potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines. We also own and lease
several facilities



Index to Financial Statements

at which we store our equipment. Some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks that are above or below ground. If these tanks were to leak, we could be responsible for the cost of
remediation as well as potential fines.

In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the
discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new

clean-up

requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that
could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In certain instances, we have obtained indemnification or covenants from third parties (including predecessors or lessors) for such

clean-up

and other obligations and liabilities. However, such third-party indemnities or covenants may not cover all of our costs and the indemnitors may not pay amounts owed to us, and such unanticipated
obligations or liabilities, or future obligations and liabilities, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify or be
indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities relating to any acquired business.

There are also other legislative and
regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions. These proposals, if enacted, could result in potential new regulations, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, or other regulatory actions. Any of these actions could result
in increased costs associated with our operations and impact the prices we charge our customers. For example, if new regulations are adopted regulating greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources such as cars and trucks, we could experience a
significant increase in environmental compliance costs in light of our large rolling-stock fleet. In addition, if our operations are perceived to result in high greenhouse gas emissions, our reputation could suffer.

We may not be successful in meeting certain regulatory requirements applicable to us and our subsidiaries.

As a public company, we are subject to the corporate governance and financial reporting requirements of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
including requirements for management to report on our internal controls over financial reporting and for our independent registered public accounting firm to express an opinion on the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. During 2016, we continued actions to ensure our ability to comply with these requirements. As of December 31, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was effective; however, there can be no assurance that our internal
control over financial reporting will be effective in future years. Failure to maintain effective internal controls or to identify significant internal control deficiencies in acquired companies (both prior acquisitions and future acquisitions)
could result in a decrease in the market value of our publicly traded securities, a reduced ability to obtain debt and equity financing, a loss of customers, or penalties and additional expenditures to meet the requirements.

Additionally, one of our subsidiaries has registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended (the Advisers Act). The Advisers Act and the rules promulgated thereunder impose substantive and material restrictions and requirements on the operations of our subsidiary, including certain fiduciary duties that apply to its relationships
with its advisory clients. The SEC has broad administrative powers to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from fines and censures to termination of an adviser’s registration. Our subsidiary is
also subject to periodic SEC examinations and other requirements, including, among other things, maintaining an effective compliance program, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements and complying with anti-fraud
prohibitions. The failure of our subsidiary to comply with the requirements of the Advisers Act could result in fines, suspensions of individual employees or other sanctions against our subsidiary that could have a material adverse effect on us.
Even if an investigation or proceeding does not result in a fine or sanction or if a fine or sanction imposed against our subsidiary or its employees were small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to an investigation, proceeding or
imposition of these fines or sanctions could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on us.

If we are unable to
enforce our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights become obsolete, our competitive position could be adversely impacted.

We utilize a variety of intellectual property rights while performing our services. We view our portfolio of proprietary energized services
tools and techniques and other process and design technologies as our competitive



Index to Financial Statements

strengths, which we believe differentiate our service offerings. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be
invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We also license certain
technologies from third parties, and there is a risk that our relationships with licensors may terminate or expire or may be interrupted or harmed. If we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, or if intellectual
property challenges or infringement proceedings succeed against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced. In addition, if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete, we may not be able to
differentiate our service offerings, and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers. As a result, our business and revenues could be materially and adversely affected.

We may incur additional healthcare costs arising from federal healthcare reform legislation.

In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively ACA)
were signed into law in the United States. The status of the ACA and any repeal or replacement thereof, is currently uncertain. Changes to laws governing health insurance could have a substantial impact on our financial results. We continue to
monitor developments under ACA, including any potential repeal or replacement thereof, and assess the extent to which any such change could result in long-term material cost increases for us.

Opportunities within the government arena could subject us to increased governmental regulation and costs.

Most government contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process, which can often be more time consuming than the bidding
process for

non-governmental

projects. Additionally, involvement with government contracts could require a significant amount of costs to be incurred before any revenues are realized from these contracts. As a
government contractor, we are also subject to a number of procurement rules and other public sector regulations, any deemed violation of which could lead to fines or penalties or a loss of business. Government agencies routinely audit and
investigate government contractors. Government agencies may review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. If a government agency determines that costs were
improperly allocated to specific contracts, such costs will not be reimbursed or a refund of previously reimbursed costs may be required. If a government agency alleges or proves improper activity, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and
serious reputational harm could result. Many government contracts must be appropriated each year. If appropriations are not made in subsequent years, we would not realize all of the potential revenues from any awarded contracts.

Our sale or issuance of additional common stock or other equity-related securities could dilute each stockholder’s ownership
interest or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

We grow our business organically as well as through
acquisitions. We often fund all or a portion of the consideration paid in connection with our acquisitions with the issuance of additional equity securities, including shares of our common stock and securities that are convertible into shares of our
common stock.

We may issue additional equity securities in the future, including in connection with future acquisitions or other
issuances of our common stock or convertible securities or otherwise. Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that we may issue up to 600,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 144,710,773 shares were outstanding as of December 31,
2016. Additionally, former owners of certain acquired companies own exchangeable shares, 6,515,453 of which were outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and included in the calculation of basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding. These
shares are exchangeable for shares of Quanta common stock on a

one-for-one

basis. Any additional issuances of common stock or exchangeable shares could have the effect
of diluting our earnings per share and our existing stockholders’ individual ownership percentages and could lead to volatility in the market price of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect that future issuances of our common stock or
other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock.



Index to Financial Statements

Certain provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an acquisition of our
company more difficult.

The following provisions of our charter documents, as currently in effect, and Delaware law could
discourage potential proposals to acquire us, delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock:

•

our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue “blank check” preferred stock and to adopt amendments to our bylaws;

•

our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings;

•

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to act by written consent; and

•

we are subject to provisions of Delaware law which restrict us from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the date
such stockholder became classified as an interested stockholder.

Facilities

We lease our corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas and maintain other facilities throughout North America and in various foreign
locations where we conduct business. Our facilities are used for offices, equipment yards, warehouses, storage and vehicle shops. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 54 of our facilities and leased the remainder. We believe that our existing
facilities are sufficient for our current needs.

Equipment

We operate a fleet of owned and leased trucks and trailers, support vehicles and specialty construction equipment, such as backhoes,
excavators, trenchers, generators, boring machines, cranes, robotic arms, wire pullers, tensioners, marine vessels and helicopters. Our owned equipment and the leasehold interests in our leased equipment are encumbered by a security interest granted
under our credit agreement. As of December 31, 2016, the total size of the rolling-stock fleet was approximately forty thousand units. Most of our fleet is serviced by our own mechanics who work at various maintenance sites and facilities. We
believe that our equipment is generally well maintained and adequate for our present operations.

Legal Pr

employment-related damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record a reserve when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and
the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we disclose matters for which management believes a material loss is at least reasonably possible. See

Unregistered Sales of Securities During the Fourth Quarter of 2016

During the three months ended December 31, 2016, we issued 104,942 shares of our common stock to certain former owners of an acquired
company in exchange, on a

one-for-one

basis, for exchangeable shares in a Canadian subsidiary of Quanta that were held by certain former owners. Additionally, subsequent
to December 31, 2016, we issued 420,904 shares of our common stock to certain former owners of an acquired company in exchange, on a

one-for-one

basis, for
exchangeable shares in a Canadian subsidiary of Quanta that were held by certain former owners. Each of the former owners originally received the exchangeable shares as partial consideration for the sale of the acquired company.

The shares of common stock issued in the above transactions were issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by
Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the shares were issued to the owners of businesses acquired in a privately negotiated transactions not involving any public offering or solicitation.

On August 5, 2015, we issued a press release announcing that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to purchase, from time to time through February 28, 2017, up to
$1.25 billion of our outstanding common stock. Repurchases under the program can be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions, including pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase arrangement, issuer repurchase plan or
otherwise, at our discretion, based on market and business conditions, applicable contractual and legal requirements and other factors. This program does not obligate us to acquire any specific amount of common stock and may be modified or
terminated by our board of directors at any time at its sole discretion and without notice. As of December 31, 2016, we had repurchased an aggregate $1.20 billion in Quanta common stock under this program. As discussed in

Accordingly, we currently do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the immediate future. The declaration, payment and amount of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors after
taking into account various factors. These factors include our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows from operations, current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans, the income tax laws then in effect and the
requirements of Delaware law. In addition, as discussed in

under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.

The following graph compares, for the period from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2016, the cumulative stockholder return on our
common stock with the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor’s



Index to Financial Statements

500 Index (the S&P 500 Index) and two peer groups selected by our management that include public companies within our industries. The companies in each peer group were selected to represent a
broad group of publicly held corporations with operations similar to ours. The current peer group (the 2016 Peer Group) includes AECOM Technology Corporation, Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., EMCOR Group Inc., Fluor Corporation, Jacobs
Engineering Group Inc., KBR, Inc., MasTec, Inc., MYR Group Inc. and Primoris Services Corporation. The peer group used in the prior year (the 2015 Peer Group) included each of the foregoing companies as well as Willbros Group, Inc. We determined not
to include Willbros Group, Inc. in the 2016 Peer Group due to dissimilarities with respect to its trading liquidity and operational performance history.

The graph below assumes an investment of $100 (with reinvestment of all dividends) in our common stock, the S&P 500 Index, the 2016 Peer
Group and the 2015 Peer Group on December 31, 2011 and tracks their relative performance through December 31, 2016. The returns of each company in the Peer Group are weighted based on the market capitalization of that company at the
beginning of the measurement period. The stock price performance reflected in the following graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

In 2016 and 2015, we recorded total asset impairment charges of $8.0 million ($7.1 million net of tax)
and $58.5 million ($44.6 million net of tax). The charges recorded in 2016 primarily relate to a pending disposition of certain international renewable energy services operations. The charges recorded in 2015 related to goodwill,
intangible assets and property and equipment, including a $39.8 million goodwill impairment and a $12.1 million



Index to Financial Statements

impairment to customer relationships, trade names and

non-compete

agreement intangible assets. These charges were primarily attributable to lower levels of
expected activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and, to a lesser extent, due to the extended low commodity price environment with respect to certain directional drilling operations in Australia. In 2015, we also recorded a $6.6 million impairment
to property and equipment associated with the same international renewable energy services operations.

(b)

The effective tax rate was lower in 2016 primarily due to $20.5 million in tax benefits from decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions, which resulted from the expiration of federal and state statute of
limitations periods. The effective tax rate in 2015 was higher primarily due to a lower proportion of income before taxes from international jurisdictions. Additionally, certain asset impairments recorded in 2015 were not tax deductible, and a
change in the Alberta provincial statutory income tax resulted in additional taxes of $5.0 million. In addition, the effective tax rates in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were impacted by $8.1 million, $9.9 million and $7.8 million in tax
benefits primarily due to decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of federal and state statute of limitations periods.

(c)

In 2014, selling, general and administrative expenses included a $102.5 million charge to provision for long-term contract receivable associated with an electric power infrastructure services project and a
$38.8 million expense resulting from an arbitration decision associated with a contract dispute on a directional drilling project.

In 2013, we recorded a

ITEM 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical
consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are based upon our current expectations and are subject to
uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to inaccurate assumptions and known or unknown risks and uncertainties, including those identified in Uncertainty of Forward-Looking
Statements and Information below and in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Introduction

We are a leading provider of specialty contracting services, offering infrastructure solutions primarily to the electric power and oil and gas
industries in the United States, Canada and Australia and select other international markets. The services we provide include the design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of infrastructure within each of the industries we serve, such as
electric power transmission and distribution networks, substation facilities, renewable energy facilities, and pipeline transmission and distribution systems and facilities.

We report our results under two reportable segments: (1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services and (2) Oil and Gas Infrastructure
Services. This structure is generally focused on broad

end-user

markets for our services. Our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were approximately $7.65 billion, of which 63%
was attributable to the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment and 37% to the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment.

Our
customers include many of the leading companies in the industries we serve. We have developed strong strategic alliances with numerous customers and strive to develop and maintain our status as a preferred vendor to our customers. We enter into
various types of contracts, including competitive unit price, hourly rate, cost-plus (or time and materials basis), and fixed price (or lump sum basis), the final terms and prices of which are frequently negotiated with the customer. Although the
terms of our contracts vary considerably, most are made on either a unit price or fixed price basis in which we agree to do the work for a price per unit of work performed (unit price) or for a fixed amount for the entire project (fixed price). We
complete a substantial majority of our fixed price projects, other than certain large transmission projects, within one year, while we frequently provide maintenance and repair work under open-ended unit price or cost-plus master service agreements
that are renewable periodically.

We recognize revenue on our unit price and cost-plus contracts as units are completed or services are
performed. For our fixed price contracts, we record revenues as work on the contract progresses on a

percentage-of-completion

basis. Under this method, revenue is
recognized based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract. Fixed price contracts generally include retainage provisions under which a percentage of the contract price is
withheld until the project is complete and has been accepted by our customer.

For internal management purposes, we are organized into two
internal divisions, namely, the Electric Power Infrastructure Services Division and the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division. These internal divisions are closely aligned with the reportable segments described above based on the predominant
type of work provided by the operating units within each division.

Reportable segment information, including revenues and operating
income by type of work, is gathered from each operating unit for the purpose of evaluating segment performance in support of our market strategies. These classifications of our operating unit revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes
can at times require judgment on the part of management. Our operating units may perform joint infrastructure service



Index to Financial Statements

projects for customers in multiple industries, deliver multiple types of infrastructure services under a single customer contract or provide services across industries. For example, we perform
joint trenching projects to install distribution lines for electric power and natural gas customers. Our integrated operations and common administrative support at each of our operating units requires that certain allocations, including allocations
of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs, indirect operating expenses including depreciation, and general and administrative costs, be made to determine operating segment profitability. Corporate costs, such as payroll and benefits,
employee travel expenses, facility costs, professional fees, acquisition costs and amortization related to intangible assets are not allocated.

The Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment provides comprehensive network solutions to customers in the electric power industry.
Services performed by the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power transmission and distribution infrastructure and substation facilities along with
other engineering and technical services. This segment also provides emergency restoration services, including the repair of infrastructure damaged by inclement weather, the energized installation, maintenance and upgrade of electric power
infrastructure utilizing unique bare hand and hot stick methods and our proprietary robotic arm technologies, and the installation of “smart grid” technologies on electric power networks. In addition, this segment designs, installs and
maintains renewable energy generation facilities, consisting of solar, wind and certain types of natural gas generation facilities, and related switchyards and transmission infrastructure. To a lesser extent, this segment provides services such as
the construction of electric power generation facilities, the design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, the installation of traffic networks and cable and control systems for light rail lines and ancillary
telecommunication infrastructure services.

The Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment provides comprehensive network solutions to
customers involved in the development and transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline products. Services performed by the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design, installation, repair and maintenance of
pipeline transmission and distribution systems, gathering systems, production systems, storage systems and compressor and pump stations, as well as related trenching, directional boring and mechanized welding services. In addition, this
segment’s services include pipeline protection, integrity testing, rehabilitation and replacement, and fabrication of pipeline support systems and related structures and facilities. We also serve the offshore and inland water energy markets,
primarily providing services to oil and gas exploration platforms, including mechanical installation (or

“hook-ups”),

electrical and instrumentation,

pre-commissioning

and commissioning, coatings, fabrication and marine asset repair. To a lesser extent, this segment designs, installs and maintains fueling systems, as well as water and sewer infrastructure.

Recent Investments, Acquisitions and Divestitures

During 2016, we completed five acquisitions. The results of four of the acquired companies are generally included in our Electric Power
Infrastructure Services segment. These companies included an electrical infrastructure services company located in Australia, a utility contracting company located in Canada, a full service medium- and high-voltage powerline contracting company
located in the United States and a telecommunications company located in Canada. We also acquired a pipeline service contractor located in the United States, the results of which are generally included in our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services
segment. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $75.9 million paid or payable in cash, subject to certain adjustments, 70,840 shares of Quanta common stock valued at approximately $1.5 million as of
the settlement date of the applicable acquisition, and contingent consideration payments of up to $39.5 million, which will be paid if certain financial targets are achieved. Based on the estimated fair value of this contingent consideration,
we have recorded an $18.7 million liability. As these transactions were effective during 2016, the results have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective dates of acquisition. These acquisitions should
enable us to further enhance our service offerings in the United States, Canada and Australia.



Index to Financial Statements

During 2015, we acquired 11 companies. The results of eight of the acquired companies are
generally included in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. These companies include a foundation services company located in the United States, an electrical contracting company located in the United States, an electrical engineering
company located in Australia, a powerline construction company located in the United States, an engineering company located in Canada, an engineering, procurement and construction services company based in the United States, an underground
construction contracting company located in Canada and a supplier and material procurement specialist for the power and utility industry in Canada. The results of the remaining three acquired companies are generally included in our Oil and Gas
Infrastructure Services segment. These companies include a company that services above-ground storage tanks in the United States, an underground utility distribution contractor that provides services to gas and electric utilities in Canada, and a
company that specializes in the engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning of compression and surface facilities for the high pressure gas industry in Australia. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions consisted of
approximately $110.6 million paid or payable in cash, subject to net working capital adjustments, 461,037 shares of Quanta common stock valued at approximately $10.1 million as of the settlement dates of the applicable acquisitions, and
$1.0 million in contingent consideration. As these transactions were effective during 2015, the results have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective dates of acquisition. These acquisitions should
enable us to further enhance our electric power and oil and gas infrastructure service offerings in the United States, Canada and Australia.

On April 29, 2015, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Crown Castle International Corp. pursuant to which we agreed to sell
our fiber optic licensing operations. The purchase agreement contained customary representations and warranties, covenants and indemnities. On August 4, 2015, we completed the sale for a purchase price of approximately $1 billion in cash,
resulting in

after-tax

net proceeds of approximately $848 million. In the third quarter of 2015, we recognized a net of tax gain of approximately $171 million. We have presented the results of
operations, financial position, cash flows and disclosures of the fiber optic licensing operations as discontinued operations for all periods in our consolidated financial statements.

During 2014, we completed nine acquisitions, which enabled us to further enhance our electric power and oil and gas infrastructure service
offerings in the United States and Canada and expand our capabilities in Australia to include electric power infrastructure service offerings. These acquisitions included four electric power infrastructure services companies located in Canada; two
oil and gas infrastructure services businesses located in Canada; an electric power infrastructure services company located in Australia; a U.S.-based general engineering and construction company specializing in hydrant fueling, waterfront and
utility construction for the U.S. Department of Defense the results of which are generally included in our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment; and a geotechnical and geological engineering services company based in the United States the
results of which are generally included in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions was approximately $279.5 million in cash, 686,382 shares of Quanta common stock and 3,825,971
exchangeable shares of Canadian subsidiaries of Quanta that are exchangeable on a

one-for-one

basis for Quanta common stock. The exchangeable shares provide holders with
rights equivalent to Quanta common stockholders with respect to dividends and other economic rights. In addition, we issued one share of Series G preferred stock associated with 899,858 of the exchangeable shares, which generally votes on the same
matters as Quanta common stock and is entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of such exchangeable shares outstanding at that time. Exchangeable shares not associated with preferred stock do not have voting rights. The aggregate value of
the securities issued on the settlement dates of the acquisitions totaled approximately $134.5 million. As these transactions were effective during 2014, the results of each acquired company have been included in our consolidated financial
statements beginning on the respective dates of acquisition.

Seasonality; Fluctuations of Results; Economic Conditions

Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced by weather, customer
spending patterns, bidding seasons, receipt of required regulatory approvals,



Index to Financial Statements

permits and rights of way, project timing and schedules, and holidays. Typically, our revenues are lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or wet conditions can cause delays
on projects. In addition, many of our customers develop their capital budgets for the coming year during the first quarter and do not begin infrastructure projects in a meaningful way until their capital budgets are finalized. Second quarter
revenues are typically higher than those in the first quarter, as some projects begin, but continued cold and wet weather can often impact second quarter productivity. Third quarter revenues are typically the highest of the year, as a greater number
of projects are underway, and weather is more accommodating. Generally, revenues during the fourth quarter of the year are lower than the third quarter but higher than the second quarter. Many projects are completed in the fourth quarter, and
revenues are often impacted positively by customers seeking to spend their capital budgets before the end of the year; however, the holiday season and inclement weather can sometimes cause delays, reducing revenues and increasing costs. Any quarter
may be positively or negatively affected by atypical weather patterns in any of the areas we serve, such as severe weather, excessive rainfall or unusual winter weather, making it difficult to predict these variations and their effect on particular
projects quarter to quarter. The timing of project awards and unanticipated changes in project schedules as a result of delays or accelerations can also create variations in the level of operating activity from quarter to quarter.

These seasonal impacts are typical for our U.S. operations, but as our foreign operations continue to grow, we may see a lessening of this
pattern impacting our quarterly revenues. For example, revenues in Canada are often higher in the first quarter as projects are accelerated so that work can be completed prior to the break up, or seasonal thaw, as productivity is adversely affected
by wet ground conditions during the warmer spring and summer months. Also, although revenues from Australia and other international operations have not been significant relative to our overall revenues to date, their seasonal patterns may differ
from those in North America and may impact our seasonality more in the future.

Additionally, our industry can be highly cyclical. Our
volume of business may be adversely affected by declines or delays in new projects due to cyclicality, which may vary by geographic region, including the United States, Canada and Australia. Project schedules, particularly in connection with larger,
longer-term projects, can also create fluctuations in the services provided, which may adversely affect us in a given period. For example, in connection with larger, more complicated projects, the timing of obtaining permits and other approvals may
be delayed, and we may need to maintain a portion of our workforce and equipment in an underutilized capacity to ensure we are strategically positioned to deliver on such projects when they move forward. Examples of other items that may cause our
results or demand for our services to fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter include: the financial condition of our customers and their access to capital; margins of projects performed during any particular period; regional, national and
global economic and market conditions; our customers capital spending, including on larger pipeline and electrical infrastructure projects; natural gas and oil prices; the timing of acquisitions, the timing and magnitude of acquisition and
integration costs associated with acquisitions; dispositions; equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates; impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets or investments; effective tax rates; and interest rates.
Accordingly, our operating results in any particular period may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other period. You should read

Outlook

and

Understanding Margins

for additional discussion of trends and
challenges that may affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Understanding Margins

Our gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues, and our operating margin is operating income expressed as a percentage
of revenues. Cost of services, which is subtracted from revenues to obtain gross profit, consists primarily of salaries, wages and benefits to employees, depreciation, fuel and other equipment expenses, equipment rentals, subcontracted services,
insurance, facilities expenses, materials and parts and supplies. Selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets are then subtracted from gross profit to obtain operating income. Various
factors — some controllable, some not — can impact our margins on a quarterly or annual basis.



Index to Financial Statements

Seasonal and geographical.

As discussed previously, seasonal patterns can have a
significant impact on margins. Generally, business is slower in the winter months versus the warmer months of the year, resulting in lower productivity and consequently reducing our ability to cover fixed costs. This can be offset somewhat by
increased demand for electrical service and repair work resulting from severe weather. Additionally, project schedules, including when projects begin and when they are completed, may impact margins. The mix of business conducted in the areas we
serve will also affect margins, as some of the areas we serve offer the opportunity for higher margins than others due to the geographic characteristics associated with the physical location where the work is being performed. Such characteristics
include whether the project is performed in an urban versus a rural setting or in a mountainous area or in open terrain. Site conditions, including unforeseen underground conditions, can also impact margins.

Weather.

Adverse or favorable weather conditions can impact gross margins in a given period. For example, snowfall or rainfall in the
areas in which we operate may negatively impact our revenues and margins due to reduced productivity, as projects may be delayed or temporarily placed on hold until weather conditions improve. Conversely, in periods when weather remains dry and
temperatures are accommodating, more work can be done, sometimes with less cost, which would have a favorable impact on margins. In some cases, severe weather, such as hurricanes and ice storms, can provide us with higher margin emergency
restoration service work, which generally has a positive impact on margins.

Revenue mix.

The mix of revenues derived from the
industries we serve and the types of services we provide within an industry will impact margins, as certain industries and services provide higher margin opportunities. Additionally, changes in our customers’ spending patterns in each of the
industries we serve can cause an imbalance in supply and demand and, therefore, affect margins and mix of revenues by industry served.

Service and maintenance versus installation.

Installation work is often performed on a fixed price basis, while maintenance work is
often performed under

pre-established

or negotiated prices or cost-plus pricing arrangements. Margins for installation work may vary from project to project, and may be higher than maintenance work, as work
obtained on a fixed price basis has higher risk than other types of pricing arrangements. We typically derive approximately 30% of our annual revenues from maintenance work, but a higher portion of installation work in any given period may affect
our gross margins for that period.

Subcontract work.

Work that is subcontracted to other service providers generally yields lower
margins. An increase in subcontract work in a given period may contribute to a decrease in margins. We typically subcontract approximately 20% to 25% of our work to other service providers.

Materials versus labor.

Typically, our customers are responsible for supplying their own materials on projects; however, for some of
our contracts, we may agree to procure all or part of the required materials. Margins may be lower on projects where we furnish a significant amount of materials, as our

mark-up

on materials is generally lower
than on our labor costs. In a given period, an increase in the percentage of work with higher materials procurement requirements may decrease our overall margins.

Size, scope and complexity of projects.

We may experience a decrease or fluctuations in margins when larger, more complex electric
transmission and pipeline projects across the industries we serve experience significant delays. Larger projects with higher voltage capacities, larger diameter throughput capacities, increased construction or design complexities, more difficult
terrain requirements or longer distance requirements typically yield opportunities for higher margins as we assume a greater degree of performance risk and allow for a higher degree of utilization of our resources for longer construction timeframes.
Conversely, smaller or less complex electric transmission and pipeline projects typically provide lower margin opportunities as there are a greater number of competitors capable of performing in this market, and competitors at times may more
aggressively pursue available volumes of work to absorb fixed costs. A greater mix of smaller scale or less complex electric transmission and pipeline work also could negatively impact margins due to the inefficiency of transitioning between a
greater number of smaller projects versus continuous production on fewer larger projects.



Index to Financial Statements

Our margins may be further impacted by delays in the timing of larger projects or temporary decreases in capital spending by our customers, as we may choose to maintain a portion of our workforce
and equipment in an underutilized capacity to ensure we are strategically positioned to deliver on larger, more complicated electric transmission or pipeline projects when they move forward.

Depreciation.

We include depreciation in cost of services. This is common practice in our industry, but it can make comparability of
our margins to those of other companies difficult. This must be taken into consideration when comparing us to other companies.

Insurance.

As discussed in

Liquidity and Capital Resources

—

Self-Insurance

, we are
insured for employer’s liability, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability claims. We also have employee health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements. Margins could be
impacted by fluctuations in insurance accruals as additional claims arise and as circumstances and conditions of existing claims change.

Performance risk.

Margins may fluctuate because of the volume of work and the impacts of pricing and job productivity, which can be
affected both favorably and negatively by, among other things, weather, geography, customer decisions and crew productivity. For example, when comparing a service contract between a current quarter and the comparable prior year’s quarter,
factors affecting the gross margins associated with the revenues generated by the contract may include pricing under the contract, the volume of work performed under the contract, the mix of the type of work specifically being performed and the
productivity of the crews performing the work. Productivity can be influenced by many factors, including where the work is performed (

e.g.,

rural versus urban area or mountainous or rocky area versus open terrain), whether the work is on an
open or encumbered right of way, the impact of inclement weather, the effects of environmental restrictions or regulatory delays, or the performance of third parties on a project. These types of factors are not practicable to quantify through
accounting data, but each of these items may individually or in the aggregate have a direct impact on the gross margin of a specific project.

Foreign currency risk.

Our financial performance is reported on a U.S. dollar-denominated basis but is partially subject to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Canadian and Australian dollars, could cause material fluctuations in comparisons of our results of operations between
periods.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to management, administrative salaries and
benefits, marketing, office rent and utilities, communications, professional fees, bad debt expense, acquisition costs, gains and losses on the sale of property and equipment, letter of credit fees and maintenance, training and conversion costs
related to the implementation of an information technology solution.

Revenues.

Revenues increased $78.9 million, or 1.0%, to $7.65 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Contributing
to the increase was a $165.7 million increase in revenues from oil and gas infrastructure services, partially offset by a $86.8 million decrease in revenues from electric power infrastructure services. The increase in revenues from oil and
gas infrastructure services primarily resulted from increased capital spending by our customers associated with larger projects, certain of which moved into full construction during the second half of 2016, after experiencing regulatory and
permitting delays in the first half of 2016, as well as from increased customer spending for natural gas distribution services. Consolidated revenues were also favorably



Index to Financial Statements

impacted by approximately $125 million due to revenues generated by acquired companies, primarily in the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. The decrease in revenues from
electric power infrastructure services resulted from reduced customer spending associated with larger electric transmission projects as customers continued to face heightened regulatory and environmental requirements from state and federal agencies
and more stringent permitting processes with various regional system operators. This regulatory environment negatively impacted the timing of existing projects and delayed the development of other infrastructure projects, which resulted in decreased
demand for our services. In addition, revenues contributed by our international operations were negatively impacted by approximately $41 million due to less favorable average foreign currency translation rates in 2016 as compared to 2015,
primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar throughout 2016.

Gross profit.

Gross
profit increased $90.1 million, or 9.8%, to $1.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 12.2% for the year ended
December 31, 2015. These increases were primarily due to better utilization of certain larger transmission project resources, mainly in the second half of 2016, as compared to the utilization of similar resources during 2015. Also contributing
to these increases was improved performance of ongoing larger pipeline and electric power projects, as we experienced increased productivity compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 which was negatively impacted by heavy snowfall and other
unfavorable weather conditions in certain areas of Canada and the northern United States. Also contributing to these increases was the contribution of profits from higher overall revenues during the current period. Gross profit and gross profit as a
percentage of revenues were adversely impacted during 2016 by project losses of $54.8 million related to a power plant construction project in Alaska, which are discussed further in the results of operations for the Electric Power
Infrastructure Services segment, as compared to project losses of $66.1 million during 2015 related to the same project and an electric transmission project in Canada completed in the third quarter of 2015.

Selling, general and administrative expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $60.5 million, or 10.2%, to
$653.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to $9.8 million in incremental costs associated with acquired companies, net of reduced acquisition costs; $8.9 million in higher
salaries and benefits from annual compensation increases and increased personnel; $8.6 million in higher incentive compensation costs associated with levels of profitability; $7.1 million in higher costs associated with ongoing technology
and business development initiatives. Also contributing to the increase were $6.3 million in severance costs associated with the departure of Quanta’s former president and chief executive officer and severance and restructuring costs
primarily associated with certain operations within the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment; $2.5 million in higher legal costs related to ongoing litigation, which included $6.9 million of litigation costs related to our
disposition of certain telecommunication operations; and $2.3 million contributed to a university endowment. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016
from 7.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Amortization of intangible assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
decreased $3.2 million to $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to reduced amortization expense from previously acquired intangible assets as certain of these assets became fully
amortized, partially offset by increased amortization of intangible assets associated with acquired companies.

Asset impairment
charges.

Asset impairment charges were $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded an asset impairment of
$6.6 million related to certain international renewable energy services operations. These assets were further impaired during the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the pending disposition of these operations. Additionally, during the fourth
quarter of 2015, we recorded a $39.8 million goodwill impairment and a $12.1 million impairment of other intangible assets related to certain operations within our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division, which were primarily
attributable to lower levels of expected activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and, to a lesser extent, due to the extended low commodity price environment with respect to certain directional drilling operations in Australia.



Index to Financial Statements

Interest expense.

Interest expense increased $6.9 million to $14.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to increased borrowing activity and a higher weighted average interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Provision for income taxes.

The provision for income taxes was $107.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, with an
effective tax rate of 34.9%. The provision for income taxes was $97.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, with an effective tax rate of 42.6%. The lower effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily
due to $20.5 million in tax benefits due to decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of federal and state statute of limitations periods, partially offset by the impact of a lower proportion of income
before taxes from international operations, which are generally taxed at lower statutory rates. The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $5.0 million related to an increase in the Alberta provincial
statutory income tax rate, effective as of June 1, 2015 and requiring a remeasurement of certain cumulative deferred tax assets and liabilities, which was partially offset by the realization of $4.2 million in tax benefits associated with
the realization of a previously unrecognized deferred tax asset related to our investment in a foreign operating subsidiary. The effective tax rate for 2015 did not reflect a significant decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions because the
statute of limitations periods remained open for various tax years under audit.

Other comprehensive income (loss).

Other
comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes was a gain of $23.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a loss of $171.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The gain in 2016 was due to a strengthening of
foreign currencies associated with our international operations, primarily the Canadian dollar, against the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2016 when compared to the exchange rates for those same currencies as of December 31, 2015. The loss
in 2015 was due to weaker foreign currencies associated with our international operations, primarily the Canadian dollar, against the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2015 when compared to the exchange rates for those same currencies as of
December 31, 2014.

2015 compared to 2014

Revenues.

Revenues decreased $174.8 million, or 2.3%, to $7.57 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. This
decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in electric power infrastructure services revenues of $365.4 million, or 6.9%, partially offset by an increase in oil and gas infrastructure services revenues of $190.6 million, or 7.8%.
Revenues from electric power infrastructure services were adversely impacted primarily by reduced customer spending and delays in project timing due to regulatory and permitting issues associated with larger electric transmission projects during the
year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, revenues contributed by our international operations were negatively impacted by approximately $227 million due to less favorable average foreign currency exchange rates as the U.S. dollar
strengthened against the Canadian and Australian dollars throughout 2015. Partially offsetting these decreases for the year ended December 31, 2015 was the favorable impact of approximately $375 million in revenues generated by acquired
companies, primarily in the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment.

Gross profit.

Gross profit decreased $245.1 million,
or 21.0%, to $923.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 12.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 15.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014. These decreases
were primarily due to the decrease in revenues from larger electric transmission and larger pipeline transmission projects, which typically yield higher margins, and an increase in revenues from services that typically yield lower margins. Gross
profit was also negatively impacted by approximately $73 million in aggregate losses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 on three projects due to increased costs associated with performance and site related factors that
adversely impacted production. The projects included the previously mentioned power plant project in Alaska, an electric transmission project in Canada substantially completed in the third quarter of 2015, and a directional drilling project in
Canada that was completed during the fourth quarter of 2015.



Index to Financial Statements

Selling, general and administrative expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased $112.6 million, or 16.0%, to $592.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to an aggregate $102.5 million charge to provision for long-term contract receivable recorded in
the third and fourth quarters of 2014 associated with an electric power infrastructure services project completed in 2012 and an aggregate $38.8 million expense recorded in the year ended December 31, 2014 associated with an adverse
arbitration decision regarding a contract dispute on a 2010 directional drilling project. Partially offsetting these decreases was $16.5 million in incremental general and administrative costs associated with acquired companies and
$11.0 million in higher costs associated with ongoing technology, business development initiatives and facilities expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 7.8% for the year ended
December 31, 2015 from 9.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to the impact of the charge to provision for long-term contract receivable and arbitration expense described above.

Amortization of intangible assets.

Amortization of intangible assets increased $0.6 million to $34.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to increased amortization of intangibles associated with acquired companies, partially offset by reduced amortization expense from previously acquired intangible assets as certain of
these assets became fully amortized.

Asset impairment charges.

Asset impairment charges were $58.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015 compared to none for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a $39.8 million goodwill impairment and a $12.1 million impairment related to customer relationships, trade
names and

non-compete

agreement intangible assets. The extended low commodity price environment had significantly impacted certain reporting units within our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division.
Specifically, lower levels of expected activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and, to a lesser extent, with respect to certain directional drilling operations in Australia resulted in impairments of goodwill and intangible assets. Additionally, we
recorded a property and equipment impairment of $6.6 million related to certain international renewable energy services operations during the fourth quarter of 2015.

Interest expense.

Interest expense increased $3.3 million to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to increased borrowing activity.

Provision for income taxes.

The provision
for income taxes was $97.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, with an effective tax rate of 42.6%. The provision for income taxes was $139.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, with an effective tax rate of
32.6%. The effective tax rate was higher in 2015 due to a lower proportion of income before taxes from international jurisdictions, which are generally taxed at lower statutory rates. Additionally, certain of the asset impairments recorded were not
deductible for tax purposes. A change in the Alberta provincial statutory income tax, effective as of June 1, 2015, which required a remeasurement of certain cumulative deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulted in additional taxes of
$5.0 million. These negative impacts were partially offset by the realization of $4.2 million in tax benefits associated with the realization of a previously unrecognized deferred tax asset related to our investment in a foreign operating
subsidiary. The effective tax rate in 2015 did not reflect a significant decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions because the statute of limitations periods remained open for various tax years under audit. The effective tax rate for 2014 was
impacted by an $8.1 million decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of federal and state statute of limitations periods.

Other comprehensive income (loss).

Other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes was a loss of $171.4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015 compared to a loss of $86.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. These losses were primarily due to less favorable foreign currency exchange rates related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the
Canadian and Australian dollars.

Electric Power Infrastructure Services Segment Results

Revenues for this segment decreased $86.8 million, or 1.8%, to $4.85 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease
was primarily a result of reduced customer spending associated with larger electric transmission projects as customers continued to face heightened regulatory and environmental requirements from state and federal agencies and more stringent
permitting processes with various regional system operators. This regulatory environment negatively impacted the timing of existing projects and delayed the development of other infrastructure projects, which resulted in decreased demand for our
services. Revenues also declined as a result of less favorable foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2016, which negatively impacted our international operations by approximately $23 million and were primarily
attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar. Partially offsetting these decreases were approximately $95 million in revenues from acquired companies and $29.9 million in higher emergency restoration
services revenues.

Operating income increased $33.4 million, or 9.2%, to $395.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2016. Operating income as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 8.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015. These increases were primarily due to better utilization of certain larger
transmission project resources as compared to the utilization of similar resources in 2015. Also contributing to these increases was improved performance of ongoing projects, as we experienced more favorable weather and increased productivity
compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, which was negatively impacted by heavy snowfall and other unfavorable weather conditions in certain areas of Canada and the northern United States. Operating income and operating income as a
percentage of revenues during 2016 were adversely impacted by project losses of $54.8 million related to performance issues on a power plant construction project in Alaska which compares to the 2015 impact of project losses of
$66.1 million primarily associated with the same project in Alaska and an electric transmission project in Canada that was completed in the third quarter of 2015.

The project losses related to the Alaska power plant construction project recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 were
primarily due to performance issues and a claimed force majeure event that disrupted the commissioning phase of the project during the second quarter of 2016. These issues resulted in higher than



Index to Financial Statements

expected production costs due to quality deficiencies and their impact on production sequencing. We provided the customer and its insurance providers with a notice of force majeure in order to
seek schedule relief and cost recovery from the disruptions. We are also in the process of developing potential claims for damages that may have resulted from third party engineering and other contractor performance issues; however, no revenues or
cost recovery has been reflected in the estimate of total project losses at December 31, 2016. This project had a contract value of $202 million and was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. As this project continues
through its final close out phase, it is possible that additional performance issues or other unforeseen circumstances could occur and result in the recognition of additional losses on this project; however, such amounts cannot currently be
estimated.

Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Segment Results

Revenues for this segment increased $165.7 million, or 6.3%, to $2.80 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. This
increase was primarily the result of increased capital spending by our customers on larger projects, certain of which moved into full construction during the second half of 2016, after experiencing regulatory and permitting delays in the first half
of 2016, as well as increased customer spending for natural gas distribution services. In addition, revenues were favorably impacted by the contribution of approximately $30 million in revenues from acquired companies. The revenues contributed
from our international operations were negatively impacted by approximately $18 million as a result of less favorable foreign currency exchange rates in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015,
primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar.

Operating income increased $6.6 million,
or 4.6%, to $149.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating income as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 5.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The
increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in revenues described above. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of segment revenues was primarily due to the negative impact on resource utilization due to permitting
delays on certain pipeline projects that were scheduled to begin in the first half of 2016 but did not start until the second half of 2016. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was also negatively impacted by approximately $2 million in
severance and restructuring costs recognized during 2016. Partially offsetting these items that negatively impacted operating income as a percentage of revenues was improved performance on certain larger pipeline projects that moved into full
construction during 2016.

Corporate and

Non-allocated

Costs

Certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets are not allocated to segments. Corporate and

non-allocated

costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $43.3 million to $224.4 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the
$51.9 million previously described goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded in the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by $4.6 million in higher costs related to ongoing litigation, which included
$6.9 million of litigation costs related to our disposition of certain telecommunication operations, and $4.0 million in costs associated with the departure of Quanta’s former president and chief executive officer recognized during
2016.

2015 compared to 2014

Electric Power Infrastructure Services Segment Results

Revenues for this segment decreased $365.4 million, or 6.9%, to $4.94 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. Revenues
from electric power infrastructure services were adversely impacted by reduced customer spending and delays in project timing due to regulatory and permitting issues associated with larger electric transmission projects. The revenues contributed
from our international operations were negatively



Index to Financial Statements

impacted by approximately $132 million as a result of less favorable foreign currency exchange rates in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2014, primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian and Australian dollars. Also contributing to the decrease was $23.4 million in lower emergency restoration services revenues. Partially offsetting these
decreases were the contribution of approximately $85 million in revenues generated by acquired companies and increased activity from smaller scale transmission and electric distribution projects due to increased spending by our customers.

Operating income decreased $100.7 million, or 21.7%, to $362.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income
as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014. These decreases were primarily due to a decrease in revenues from large electric transmission
projects mentioned above, which typically yield higher margins, and a corresponding increase in lower margin revenues from smaller scale transmission work. This change in revenue mix also resulted in increased inefficiencies associated with
transitioning between smaller projects that are not experienced during continuous production on larger projects, as well as certain large transmission resources being underutilized during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, operating
income and operating income as a percentage of segment revenues decreased in 2015 due to the negative impact of approximately $66.1 million in aggregate losses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 on two projects due to
increased costs associated with performance and site related factors that adversely impacted production. These projects included the power plant project in Alaska and the electric transmission project in Canada described above. Also contributing to
the decreases was the negative impact on production for various projects due to heavy snowfall and other unfavorable weather conditions in certain areas of Canada and the northern United States during the first three months of 2015 and a property
and equipment impairment of $6.6 million related to certain international renewable energy services operations recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, lower emergency restoration services revenues impacted margins since such
services typically yield higher margins. Operating income and margins during 2014 were negatively impacted by the $102.5 million charge to provision for long-term contract receivable associated with an electric power infrastructure services
project completed in 2012 described above.

Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Segment Results

Revenues for this segment increased $190.6 million, or 7.8%, to $2.64 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. Revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2015 were favorably impacted by approximately $290 million in revenues generated by acquired companies. Increased revenues from distribution and other services also impacted revenues in 2015. These increases
were partially offset by reduced demand for certain services due to lower oil prices and their impact on customer spending, fluctuations in larger project timing and regulatory delays on certain other larger diameter pipe projects that shifted work
from the second half of 2015 into 2016. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 also reflect the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which negatively impacted revenues contributed by our international operations
by approximately $95 million as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian and Australian dollars.

Operating income decreased $19.9 million, or 12.2%, to $142.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income as
a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 5.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decreases were primarily due to a decrease in transmission revenues, which typically yield higher
margins, and project losses of approximately $7 million on a directional drilling project in Canada that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues was lower
demand for services associated with certain operations as a result of lower oil prices, which negatively impacted this segment’s ability to cover fixed and overhead costs. These decreases were partially offset by the impact during the year
ended December 31, 2014 of an aggregate $38.8 million expense associated with an adverse arbitration decision regarding a contract dispute on a 2010 directional drilling project as well as an increase in the estimated withdrawal liability
associated with the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (the Central States Plan) based on an increase in the estimated range of possible liability.

Corporate and

Non-allocated

Costs

Certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets are not allocated to segments. Corporate and

non-allocated

costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $71.0 million to $267.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily due to the
$51.9 million previously described goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded in the year ended December 31, 2015, $10.9 million in higher salaries and benefits associated with cost of living increases and increased
personnel, $8.1 million in higher costs associated with ongoing technology and business development initiatives, and $3.6 million in higher consulting and professional fees. These increases were partially offset by a $6.8 million
decrease in acquisition and integration costs due to the smaller size and reduced complexity of our acquisitions closed in 2015.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Cash Requirements

Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $112.2 million and $128.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash and cash equivalents held in domestic bank accounts were approximately $19.5 million and $16.1 million, and cash and cash equivalents held in foreign bank accounts were approximately $92.7 million
and $112.7 million. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash and cash equivalents held by our investments in joint ventures, which are either consolidated or proportionately consolidated, were approximately $11.5 million and
$24.9 million, of which $10.0 million and $11.9 million related to domestic joint ventures. Cash and cash equivalents held by the joint ventures are available to support the operations of the related joint ventures, and we do not have
access to that cash for our other operations. Under the terms of the partnership agreements, we generally have no right to the joint ventures’ cash other than participating in distributions and in the event of dissolution.

We were in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement at December 31, 2016. We anticipate that our cash and cash
equivalents on hand, existing borrowing capacity under our credit facility, and our future cash flows from operations will provide sufficient funds to enable us to meet our future operating needs and our planned capital expenditures, as well as
facilitate our ability to grow in the foreseeable future.

Our industry is capital intensive, and we expect the need for substantial
capital expenditures to continue into the foreseeable future to meet the anticipated demand for our services. Capital expenditures related to continuing operations are expected to total $210 million to $225 million for 2017.

We also evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions from time to time that may require cash, as well as opportunities to make
investments in customer-sponsored projects where we anticipate performing services such as project management, engineering, procurement or construction services. These investment opportunities exist in the markets and industries we serve and may
require the use of cash in the form of debt or equity investments.

Management continues to monitor the financial markets and general
national and global economic conditions for factors that may affect our liquidity and capital resources. We consider our cash and cash equivalents investment policies to be conservative in that we maintain a diverse portfolio of what we believe to
be high-quality cash and cash equivalent investments with short-term maturities. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that any weakness in the capital markets will have a material impact on the principal amounts of our cash and cash equivalents or our
ability to rely upon our credit facility for funds. To date, we have experienced no loss of or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents or funds under our credit facility; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash
and cash equivalents or availability under our credit facility will not be impacted in the future by adverse conditions in the financial markets.

We have not provided U.S. income taxes on approximately $298.8 million of accumulated foreign earnings that we intend to permanently
reinvest outside the United States. We could be subject to additional U.S. income



Index to Financial Statements

and foreign withholding taxes if we were to repatriate cash that is indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Because of the number and variability of assumptions required, it is not
practicable to determine the amount of any additional U.S. tax liability that may result if we decide to no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings outside the United States. If our intentions or U.S. tax laws change in the future, there may
be a significant negative impact on the provision for income taxes and cash flows as a result of recording an incremental tax liability in the period such change occurs.

Sources and Uses of Cash

As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $112.2 million and working capital of $1.08 billion. We also had
$305.6 million of outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, $210.8 million of which was denominated in U.S. dollars and $94.8 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in Australian
or Canadian dollars. We also had $351.3 million of outstanding revolving loans under our credit facility, $210.0 million of which was denominated in U.S. dollars and $141.3 million of which was denominated in Canadian dollars. As of
December 31, 2016, our $1.81 billion senior secured revolving credit facility, which matures on December 18, 2020, had $1.15 billion available for revolving loans or issuing new letters of credit or bank guarantees.

Operating Activities

Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our services and operating margins but can also be influenced by working
capital needs associated with the various types of services that we provide. In particular, working capital needs may increase when we commence large volumes of work under circumstances where project costs, primarily associated with labor, equipment
and subcontractors, are required to be paid before the receivables resulting from the work performed are billed and collected. Accordingly, changes within working capital in accounts receivable, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on
uncompleted contracts, and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are normally related and are typically affected on a collective basis by changes in revenue due to both changes in the timing and volume of work
performed and variability in the timing of customer billings and payments. Additionally, working capital needs are generally higher during the summer and fall months due to increased demand for our services when favorable weather conditions exist in
many of the regions in which we operate. Conversely, working capital assets are typically converted to cash during the winter months. These seasonal trends can be offset by changes in the timing of projects which can be impacted by project delays or
accelerations and other economic factors that may affect customer spending.

Operating activities of continuing operations provided net
cash of $381.2 million during 2016 as compared to $618.2 million during 2015 and $247.7 million during 2014. This decrease was primarily due to additional working capital requirements associated with larger oil and gas infrastructure
projects that moved into full construction during the second half of 2016 and invoicing challenges and billing delays on two related electric transmission projects located in remote regions of northeastern Canada, which resulted from extensive
quality assurance documentation and administrative requirements. We continue to work collaboratively with this customer to improve the invoicing and billing processes on these projects. Operating activities of continuing operations for 2015 were
positively impacted by the receipt of a $65 million cash payment associated with the settlement of a large project receivable that was resolved in 2014, as well as the benefit from a corresponding reduction in income tax payments during early
2015 that resulted from the prior year charge to selling, general and administrative expenses of $102.5 million associated with this settlement. The increase in cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended
December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was also due to decreased working capital requirements associated with fewer larger electric transmission projects during 2015 as compared to 2014. Also impacting cash flow
from operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 was the receipt of $86.8 million related to favorable billing terms for certain projects that began in 2015. Cash flow from operating activities of
continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 was negatively impacted by weather related delays in part of North



Index to Financial Statements

America, the timing of project close-outs that affected the achievement of certain billing milestones, and a $28.3 million payment associated with an arbitration decision associated with
claims from a directional drilling project.

Days sales outstanding (DSO) as of December 31, 2016 was 74 days, as compared to 75 days
as of December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to favorable billing terms for certain projects ongoing in 2016 as compared to projects ongoing in 2015, partially offset by the impact of invoicing challenges and billing delays on the
two related large electric transmission projects in remote regions of northeastern Canada discussed above. DSO is calculated by using the sum of current accounts receivable, net of allowance (which includes retainage and unbilled balances), plus
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts less billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts, divided by average revenues per day during the quarter.

Investing Activities

During 2016, we used net cash in investing activities of continuing operations of $266.0 million as compared to $307.1 million and
$488.6 million used in investing activities of continuing operations in 2015 and 2014. Investing activities of continuing operations in 2016 included $212.6 million used for capital expenditures and $68.8 million used in connection
with acquisitions, partially offset by $22.0 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. Investing activities of continuing operations in 2015 included $210.0 million used for capital expenditures and $112.9 million
used in connection with acquisitions, partially offset by $26.2 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. Investing activities of continuing operations in 2014 included $247.2 million used for capital expenditures and
$262.2 million used in connection with acquisitions, partially offset by $14.4 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.

Financing Activities

During 2016, net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was $124.8 million as compared to net cash used by financing
activities of continuing operations of $1.22 billion and $58.3 million in 2015 and 2014. Financing activities of continuing operations during 2016 included $116.2 million of net repayments under our credit facility. Financing
activities of continuing operations in 2015 included $1.61 billion for common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase programs and $21.2 million of cash payments to

non-controlling

interests as
distributions of joint venture profits, partially offset by $413.6 million of net borrowings under our credit facility. Financing activities of continuing operations in 2014 included $93.5 million of common stock repurchases under a stock
repurchase program approved by Quanta’s board of directors during the fourth quarter of 2013 (the 2013 Repurchase Program), $30.4 million of debt repayments primarily related to debt of acquired companies that was repaid shortly after the
respective acquisition dates and $14.4 million of cash payments to

non-controlling

interests as distributions of joint venture profits, partially offset by $71.8 million of net borrowings under our
credit facility.

On August 4, 2015, we completed the sale of our fiber optic licensing operations for a purchase price of
approximately $1 billion in cash, resulting in

after-tax

net proceeds of approximately $848 million. We have presented the results of operations, financial position, cash flows and disclosures of the
fiber optic licensing operations as discontinued operations for all periods in our consolidated financial statements. A cash tax payment of approximately $134 million related to the gain was paid in the fourth quarter of 2015 and was included
in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities from discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Stock Repurchases

During
the third quarter of 2015, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to purchase, from time to time through February 28, 2017, up to $1.25 billion of our outstanding common stock



Index to Financial Statements

(the 2015 Repurchase Program). Repurchases under the 2015 Repurchase Program can be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions, including pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase
arrangement, an issuer repurchase plan or otherwise, at our discretion, based on market and business conditions, applicable contractual and legal requirements and other factors. The 2015 Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any
specific amount of common stock and may be modified or terminated by our board of directors at any time at its sole discretion and without notice. During 2015, we repurchased 19.2 million shares of our common stock at a cost of
$449.9 million in the open market under the 2015 Repurchase Program.

Also during the third quarter of 2015, we entered into an
accelerated share repurchase arrangement (the ASR) to repurchase $750.0 million of our common stock under the 2015 Repurchase Program. Under the terms of the ASR, we paid $750.0 million to JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, London
Branch (JPMorgan) and initially received 25.7 million shares of our common stock. The fair market value of these 25.7 million shares at the time of delivery was approximately $600.0 million, and the repurchased shares and the related
cost to acquire them were accounted for as an adjustment to the balance of treasury stock during the quarter ended September 30, 2015, reducing the weighted-average number of basic and diluted common shares used to calculate our earnings per
share. The $150.0 million remaining under the ASR was recorded as an adjustment to additional

paid-in

capital (APIC) during the third quarter of 2015 and was reclassified from APIC to treasury stock as a
result of the final settlement of the ASR on April 12, 2016. Upon final settlement and based on the final volume-weighted average share price during the term of the ASR, minus a discount and subject to other adjustments pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the ASR, we received 9.4 million additional shares of our common stock from JPMorgan. As of December 31, 2016, we had repurchased 54.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $1.20 billion, and
approximately $50.1 million remained available under the 2015 Repurchase Program.

During the fourth quarter of 2013, our board of
directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to purchase from time to time through December 31, 2016, up to $500.0 million of our outstanding common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we repurchased a
total of 3.0 million shares valued at $93.5 million pursuant to the 2013 Repurchase Program. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 14.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $406.5 million in the open
market and completed the 2013 Repurchase Program.

Debt Instruments

Credit Facility

On
December 18, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with various lenders that provides for a $1.81 billion senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on December 18, 2020. The entire amount available
under the facility may be used by us for revolving loans and letters of credit in U.S. dollars and certain alternative currencies. Up to $600.0 million of the facility may be used by certain of our subsidiaries for revolving loans and letters
of credit in certain alternative currencies. Up to $100.0 million of the facility may be used for swing line loans in U.S. dollars, up to $50.0 million of the facility may be used for swing line loans in Canadian dollars and up to
$30.0 million of the facility may be used for swing line loans in Australian dollars. In addition, subject to the conditions specified in the credit agreement, we have the option to increase the revolving commitments by up to
$400.0 million from time to time upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Borrowings under the credit agreement are to be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures and
other general corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $305.6 million of outstanding letters of credit
and bank guarantees, $210.8 million of which were denominated in U.S. dollars and $94.8 million of which were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in Australian or Canadian dollars. We also had
$351.3 million of outstanding revolving loans under the credit facility, $210.0 million of which were denominated in U.S. dollars and $141.3 million of which were denominated in Canadian dollars. The remaining $1.15 billion was
available for revolving loans or new letters of credit or bank guarantees.



Index to Financial Statements

Under our current credit agreement, amounts borrowed in U.S. dollars bear interest, at our
option, at a rate equal to either (i) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 1.125% to 2.125%, as determined based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as described below), or (ii) the Base Rate (as described below)
plus 0.125% to 1.125%, as determined based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Amounts borrowed as revolving loans under the credit agreement in any currency other than U.S. dollars bear interest at a rate equal to the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.125%
to 2.125%, as determined based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Standby letters of credit issued under the credit agreement are subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.125% to 2.125%, based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, and Performance
Letters of Credit (as defined in the credit agreement) issued under the credit agreement in support of certain contractual obligations are subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.675% to 1.275%, based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio. We are also
subject to a commitment fee of 0.20% to 0.40%, based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, on any unused availability under the credit agreement.

The Consolidated Leverage Ratio is the ratio of our Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA (as those terms are defined in the
credit agreement). For purposes of calculating our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Funded Indebtedness is reduced by available cash and Cash Equivalents (as defined in the credit agreement) in excess of $25.0 million. The Base Rate equals
the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 0.5%, (ii) the prime rate publicly announced by Bank of America, N.A. and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.00%.

Subject to certain exceptions, the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our wholly owned U.S.
subsidiaries and by a pledge of all of the capital stock of our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of direct foreign subsidiaries of our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries. Our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries also guarantee the
repayment of all amounts due under the credit agreement. Subject to certain conditions, all collateral will automatically be released from the liens at any time we maintain an Investment Grade Rating (defined in the credit agreement as two of the
following three conditions being met: (i) a corporate credit rating that is

BBB-

or higher by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, (ii) a corporate family rating that is Baa3 or higher by
Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. or (iii) a corporate credit rating that is

BBB-

or higher by Fitch Ratings, Inc.).

The credit agreement contains certain covenants, including a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage
Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement). The credit agreement also limits certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, indebtedness, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits liens on our
assets. The credit agreement allows cash payments for dividends and stock repurchases subject to compliance with the following requirements (after giving effect to the dividend or stock repurchase): (i) no default or event of default under the
credit agreement; (ii) continued compliance with the financial covenants in the credit agreement; and (iii) at least $100.0 million of availability under the credit agreement and/or cash and cash equivalents on hand. As of
December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the covenants in the credit agreement.

The credit agreement provides for
customary events of default and contains cross-default provisions with our underwriting, continuing indemnity and security agreement with our sureties and all of our other debt instruments exceeding $100.0 million in borrowings or availability.
If an Event of Default (as defined in the credit agreement) occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the credit agreement, the lenders may declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid interest
immediately due and payable, require that we provide cash collateral for all outstanding letter of credit obligations, terminate the commitments under the credit agreement, and foreclose on the collateral.

Prior to the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement on December 18, 2015 and after April 1, 2014, amounts borrowed bore
interest at the same rates as above, and we were subject to the same commitment fees as above. Prior to April 1, 2014, amounts borrowed in U.S. dollars bore interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (i) the Eurocurrency Rate plus
1.25%, or (ii) the Base Rate plus 0.25%, and amounts borrowed as



Index to Financial Statements

revolving loans in any currency other than U.S. dollars bore interest at a rate equal to the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.25%. Prior to April 1, 2014, standby letters of credit issued under the
credit agreement were also subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.25%. Performance Letters of Credit issued in support of certain contractual obligations were subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.75%, and we were also subject to a commitment fee
of 0.20% on any unused availability under the credit agreement.

Off-Balance

Sheet
Transactions

As is common in our industry, we have entered into certain

off-balance

sheet
arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets. Our significant

off-balance

sheet transactions include liabilities associated with

non-cancelable

operating leases, letter of credit obligations, commitments to purchase equipment, surety guarantees related to performance bonds, certain multiemployer pension plan liabilities and obligations
relating to our investments and joint venture arrangements. Certain joint venture structures involve risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets. For certain joint ventures, we have guaranteed all of the obligations of the joint venture under
a contract with the customer. Additionally, other joint venture arrangements qualify as a general partnership, for which we are jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of the joint venture. In our joint venture arrangements,
typically each joint venturer indemnifies the other party for any liabilities incurred in excess of the liabilities such other party is obligated to bear under the respective joint venture agreement. Other than as discussed in this report, we have
not engaged in any material

off-balance

sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities, and we have no material guarantees of the work or obligations of third parties.

Leases

We enter into

non-cancelable

operating leases for many of our facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities, vehicles and equipment rather
than purchasing them. We may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term, in which case we are typically liable to the lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease.

We have guaranteed the residual value of the underlying assets under certain of our equipment operating leases at the date of termination of
such leases. We have agreed to pay any difference between this residual value and the fair market value of each underlying asset as of the lease termination date. As of December 31, 2016, the maximum guaranteed residual value was approximately
$556.5 million. We believe that no significant payments will be made as a result of the difference between the fair market value of the leased equipment and the guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no assurance that future
significant payments will not be required.

Letters of Credit

Certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf, such as to
beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance programs. In addition, from time to time, certain customers require us to post letters of credit to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts and to guarantee performance
under our contracts. Such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution, typically pursuant to our credit agreement. Each letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of
credit if the holder claims that we have failed to perform specified actions. If this were to occur, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement, we may also be
required to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. We do not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2016, we had $305.6 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees to secure our casualty insurance
program and various contractual commitments. These are irrevocable

stand-by



Index to Financial Statements

letters of credit with maturities generally expiring at various times throughout 2017. Upon maturity, it is expected that the majority of the letters of credit related to the casualty insurance
program will be renewed for subsequent

one-year

periods.

Performance Bonds and Parent
Guarantees

Many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds issued
by a financial institution known as a surety. These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay
subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs. Under our underwriting, continuing indemnity and security
agreement with our sureties and with the consent of the lenders that are party to our credit agreement, we have granted security interests in certain of our assets to collateralize our obligations to the sureties. Subject to certain conditions and
consistent with terms of our credit agreement, these security interests will be automatically released if we maintain a credit rating that meets two of the following three conditions: (i) a corporate credit rating that is

BBB-

or higher by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, (ii) a corporate family rating that is Baa3 or higher by Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. or (iii) a corporate credit rating that is

BBB-

or higher by Fitch Ratings, Inc. We may be required to post letters of credit or other collateral in favor of the sureties or our customers in the future. Posting letters of credit in favor of the sureties or
our customers would reduce the borrowing availability under our credit facility. To date, we have not been required to make any reimbursements to our sureties for bond-related costs. We believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund
significant claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2016, the total amount of outstanding performance bonds was estimated to be approximately $3.4 billion. Our estimated maximum exposure as it
relates to the value of performance bonds outstanding is lowered on each bonded project as the cost to complete is reduced, and each of our commitments under the performance bonds generally extinguishes concurrently with the expiration of our
related contractual obligation. The estimated cost to complete these bonded projects was approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2016.

Additionally, from time to time, we guarantee the obligations of our wholly owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts
with customers, certain lease obligations, certain joint venture arrangements and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors’ licenses. We are not aware of any material obligations for performance or payment asserted
against us under any of these guarantees.

Assuming the principal amount outstanding at December 31, 2016 remained outstanding and the interest rate in effect at December 31, 2016 remained the same, the annual cash interest
expense with respect to the credit facility would be approximately $8.6 million, payable for the remainder of the term of the facility, which matures in December 2020.

A return of capital from unconsolidated affiliates of approximately $42.1 million is anticipated in August 2017 and is not included in these amounts. As of December 31, 2016, we had made aggregate
contributions to this unconsolidated affiliate of $13.5 million and had received $2.9 million as a return of capital.

Equipment Purchase Commitments

We have committed capital for the expansion of our vehicle fleet in order to accommodate manufacturer lead times on certain types of vehicles.
As of December 31, 2016, production orders for approximately $22.4 million had been issued with delivery dates scheduled to occur throughout 2017. Although we have committed to the purchase of these vehicles at the time of their delivery,
we intend that these orders will be assigned to third party leasing companies and made available to us under certain of our master equipment lease agreements, which will release us from our capital commitment.

Capital Commitments Related to Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

We have excluded from the Contractual Obligations table additional capital commitments associated with investments in unconsolidated affiliates
related to planned oil and gas infrastructure projects of approximately $20.2 million because we are unable to determine the exact timing of these capital commitments. We anticipate these commitments to be paid by May 31, 2022 and as
specific commitment amounts and their timing are determined, we will reflect such amounts in the Contractual Obligations table.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

During 2016, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination related to tax years 2010, 2011 and 2012; however, certain
subsidiaries remain under examination by various U.S. state, Canadian and other foreign tax authorities for multiple periods, and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could therefore increase or decrease as a result of the expiration of certain
statute of limitations periods or settlements of these examinations. We believe it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $12.3 million due to the expiration of certain statute of
limitations periods or settlements of the examinations.

Multiemployer Pension Plans

The previously presented table of estimated contractual obligations does not reflect the obligations under the multiemployer pension plans in
which our union employees participate. Some of our operating units are parties to various collective bargaining agreements that require us to provide to the employees subject to these agreements specified wages and benefits, as well as to make
contributions to multiemployer pension plans. Our multiemployer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in the collective bargaining agreements (usually on an annual basis), and contributions are made to the plans on a

“pay-as-you-go”

basis based on our union employee payrolls. The location and number of union employees that we employ at any
given time and the plans in which they may participate vary depending on the projects we have ongoing at any time and the need for union resources in connection with those projects. Therefore, we are unable to accurately predict our union employee
payroll and the amount of the resulting multiemployer pension plan contribution obligations for future periods.



Index to Financial Statements

We may also be required to make additional contributions to our multiemployer pension plans if
they become underfunded, and these additional contributions will be determined based on our union employee payrolls. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added special funding and operational rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after
2007 for multiemployer plans that are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding
improvement or rehabilitation plan, as applicable, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. A number of multiemployer plans
to which our operating units contribute or may contribute in the future are in “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status. The amount of additional funds, if any, that we may be obligated to contribute to
these plans in the future cannot be reasonably estimated and are not included in the above table due to uncertainty of the future levels of work that require the specific use of the union employees covered by these plans, as well as the future
contribution levels and possible surcharges on contributions applicable to these plans.

We may also have additional liabilities imposed
by law as a result of our participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon
employers who are contributors to a multiemployer plan if the employer withdraws from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. These liabilities include an allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits in the plan for
all plan participants, not merely the benefits payable to a contributing employer’s own retirees. Other than as noted below, we are not aware of any material amounts of withdrawal liability that have been or are expected to be incurred as a
result of a withdrawal by any of our operating units from any multiemployer defined benefit pension plans.

2011 Central States Plan
Withdrawal Liability.

In the fourth quarter of 2011, certain of our subsidiaries withdrew from the Central States Plan. This withdrawal event was the result of an amendment to a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood
of Teamsters (Teamsters) that eliminated certain employers’ obligations to contribute to the Central States Plan, which was then in critical status and significantly underfunded as to its vested benefit obligations. The amendment was negotiated
by the Pipe Line Contractors Association (PLCA) on behalf of its members, which include certain of our subsidiaries. Because certain of our other subsidiaries continued participation in the Central States Plan into 2012, the subsidiaries’
withdrawals in 2011 effected only a partial withdrawal on our behalf in 2011. We believed that the partial withdrawal was advantageous because it limited exposure to increased liability resulting from a future withdrawal event, at which point
the Central States Plan could have been further underfunded. We and other PLCA members now contribute to a different multiemployer pension plan on behalf of the affected Teamsters employees. While certain of our subsidiaries continued participation
in the Central States Plan into 2012, we believe that such subsidiaries withdrew from the Central States Plan in 2012, thereby effecting a complete withdrawal as of December 30, 2012 for all Quanta subsidiaries.

In connection with the partial withdrawal in 2011, we recorded a withdrawal liability of approximately $32.6 million in the fourth
quarter of 2011 based on estimates received from the Central States Plan. The Central States Plan subsequently asserted that the withdrawal of the PLCA members, and thus our partial withdrawal, was not effective in 2011. The PLCA and Quanta believed
at that time that a legally effective withdrawal had occurred during the fourth quarter of 2011, and this issue was litigated in the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. In September 2013, the district
court ruled in favor of the Central States Plan, and that decision was appealed by the PLCA. In July 2014, the Central States Plan provided us with a Notice and Demand claiming partial withdrawal liability in the amount of $39.6 million and
requiring Quanta to make payments on this assessment while the dispute is ongoing. In September 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled in favor of the PLCA and reversed the district court’s previous ruling, which
had been in favor of the Central States Plan. Based on the outcome of the appeal, in January 2016, the Central States Plan issued a revised Notice and Demand claiming partial withdrawal liability in the amount of $32.9 million.



Index to Financial Statements

Separately, in December 2013, the Central States Plan filed lawsuits against two of our
subsidiaries in connection with their withdrawal in 2012. In the first lawsuit, the Central States Plan alleged that the subsidiary elected to participate in the Central States Plan pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement under which it
participated. We argued that no such election was made and that any payments made to the Central States Plan were made in error. In July 2014, the parties reached an agreement to settle the lawsuit, and the court dismissed the case with prejudice.
In the second lawsuit, the Central States Plan alleged that contributions made by our subsidiary to a new industry fund created after we withdrew from the Central States Plan should have been made to the Central States Plan. This arguably would have
extended our withdrawal date for this subsidiary to at least the end of 2013. We disputed these allegations on the basis that we properly paid contributions to the new industry fund based on the terms of the collective bargaining agreement under
which we participated and asserted that we terminated our obligation to contribute to the Central States Plan by the end of 2012. The parties both moved for summary judgment, and in March 2015, the court entered judgment in our favor. The Central
States Plan filed a notice of appeal in April 2015, and in December 2015, the Central States Plan agreed to dismiss the appeal with prejudice.

The ultimate liability associated with the complete withdrawal of our subsidiaries from the Central States Plan will depend on various
factors, including interpretations of the terms of the collective bargaining agreements under which the subsidiaries participated and whether exemptions from withdrawal liability applicable to construction industry employers will be available. In
March 2014, the Central States Plan provided revised estimates indicating that the total withdrawal liability based on certain withdrawal scenarios from 2011 through 2014 could range between $40.1 million and $55.4 million, which we
believe to be the range of reasonably possible loss for this matter. Additionally, based on those estimates and allowing for the exclusion of amounts believed by management to have been improperly included in such estimates, we recorded an
adjustment to cost of services during the three months ended March 31, 2014 to increase the recognized withdrawal liability to an amount within the range communicated to us by the Central States Plan. Given the unknown nature of some of the
factors mentioned above, the final withdrawal liability cannot yet be determined with certainty. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that the amount owed upon final resolution of these matters could be materially higher than the expense we
recognized through December 31, 2016. Although we dispute the total liability owed to the Central States Plan, we continue to make monthly payments according to the terms of the January 2016 Notice and Demand while the parties determine the
final withdrawal liability. As of December 31, 2016, we had made payments totaling $17.5 million toward the withdrawal liability assessment.

2013 Central States Plan Withdrawal Liability.

On October 9, 2013, we acquired a company that experienced a complete withdrawal
from the Central States Plan prior to the date of acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, the Central States Plan issued a Notice and Demand to the acquired company claiming a withdrawal liability in the total amount of $6.9 million and
requiring payments to be made on this assessment while the dispute is ongoing. In connection with the acquisition, we recorded an initial liability of $4.8 million related to this withdrawal liability, and a portion of the purchase price for
the acquired company was deposited into an escrow account to fund any withdrawal obligation in excess of the initial liability recorded. In January 2016, the Central States Plan issued a revised Notice and Demand claiming a withdrawal liability in
the amount of $4.8 million. Although we continue to dispute the total liability owed to the Central States Plan, we continue to make monthly payments according to the terms of this revised Notice and Demand while the parties determine the final
withdrawal liability. As of December 31, 2016, payments totaling $3.5 million had been made toward the withdrawal liability assessment.

The final amount of withdrawal liability payable in connection with this matter remains the subject of a pending arbitration proceeding and
will ultimately depend on various factors, including the outcome of the PLCA litigation described above. However, the acquired company’s withdrawal from the Central States Plan is not expected to have a material impact on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Letters of Credit Fees and Commitment Fees

We have excluded from the Contractual Obligations table interest associated with letters of credit fees and commitment fees under our credit

above.

Self-Insurance

We are insured for employer’s liability, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability claims. Under these programs,
the deductible for employer’s liability is $1.0 million per occurrence, the deductible for workers’ compensation is $5.0 million per occurrence, and the deductibles for auto liability and general liability are $10.0 million
per occurrence. We are generally self-insured for all claims that do not exceed the amount of the applicable deductible. In connection with our casualty insurance programs, we are required to issue letters of credit to secure our self-insured
obligations. We also have employee health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $0.4 million per claimant per year.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate
of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of
our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the
gross amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $218.2 million and $209.0 million, with $162.0 million and $153.5 million considered to be long-term and included in other

non-current

liabilities. Related insurance recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $8.7 million and $8.6 million, of which $0.4 million and $0.6 million were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and
$8.3 million and $8.0 million were included in other assets, net.

We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and
therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel our coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or we may elect not to obtain certain types or incremental levels
of insurance if we believe that the cost to obtain such coverage exceeds the additional benefits obtained. In any such event, our overall risk exposure would increase, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows. The Contractual Obligations table excludes commitments associated with our insurance liabilities, as we are unable to determine the timing of payments related to these obligations.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

We are subject to concentrations of credit risk related primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and our net receivable position with
customers, which includes amounts related to billed and unbilled accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts net of advanced billings with the same customer. Substantially all of our cash and
cash equivalent investments are managed by what we believe to be high credit quality financial institutions. In accordance with our investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest cash and cash equivalents in a diversified portfolio
of what we believe to be high quality investments, which primarily include interest-bearing demand deposits, money market investments, money market mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper with original maturities of three months or less.
Although we do not currently believe the principal amount of these investments is subject to any material risk of loss, changes in economic conditions could impact the interest income we receive from these investments. In addition, we grant credit
under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, to our customers, which include electric power and oil and gas companies, governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties
located primarily in the United States, Canada and Australia. Consequently, we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the United States, Canada and Australia, which may be heightened as a
result of uncertain



Index to Financial Statements

economic and financial market conditions that have existed in recent years. However, we generally have certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Historically, some of our
customers have experienced significant financial difficulties, and others may experience financial difficulties in the future. These difficulties expose us to increased risk related to collectability of billed and unbilled receivables and costs and
estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts for services we have performed.

At December 31, 2016 and 2015, one
customer within our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment accounted for approximately 16% and 12% of our consolidated net receivable position. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net receivable position for this customer was
$277.3 million and $195.2 million, which included $175.9 million and $83.9 million of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. These balances were associated with invoicing challenges and
billing delays on two related electric transmission projects located in remote regions of northeastern Canada that resulted from extensive quality assurance documentation and administrative requirements. We continue to work collaboratively with the
customer to improve these processes, which has resulted in increased billings and payment activity in the latter half of 2016. Partially offsetting these decreases to this net receivable position was the impact of additional change orders and claims
on the project that were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business. No other customers represented 10% or more of our consolidated net receivable position as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. No customers represented 10%
or more of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Legal Proceedings

We are from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These
actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract and/or property damages, employment-related damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record a reserve when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we disclose matters for which management believes a
material loss is at least reasonably possible. See

Related Party Transactions

In the normal course of business, we enter into transactions from time to time with related parties. Our significant related party transactions
typically take the form of facility leases with prior owners of certain acquired companies.

Inflation

Due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, inflation did not have a
significant effect on our results.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2015, the FASB issued an update which amends consolidation guidance, including amending the guidance related to determining whether
an entity is a variable interest entity. The guidance may be applied using a modified retrospective approach whereby the entity records a cumulative effect of adoption at the beginning of the fiscal year of initial application. A reporting entity
may also apply the amendments on a full retrospective basis. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016, and the adoption of the update did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.



Index to Financial Statements

In April 2015, the FASB issued an update that requires debt issuance costs related to a
recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts and premiums. The update is required to be adopted retroactively
for all periods presented. In August 2015, the FASB issued another update that states that the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently
amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the

line-of-credit

arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the

line-of-credit

arrangement. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016, and the adoption of the update did not have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements or related disclosures.

In April 2015, the FASB issued an update that provides guidance to customers about whether a
cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other
software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. An entity can elect to adopt the amendments either prospectively to all arrangements
entered into or materially modified after the effective date or retrospectively. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016, and the adoption of the update did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements
or related disclosures.

In September 2015, the FASB issued an update that requires an acquiring company to recognize adjustments to
provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which such adjustments are determined. An acquiring company must record any effect on earnings from changes in depreciation or amortization or other
income effects, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The acquiring company must also present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the amount recorded in current-period
earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The update is required to be adopted prospectively to adjustments that occur after the effective date with earlier
application permitted for financial statements that have not yet been issued. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016, and the adoption of the update did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or
related disclosures.

In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance to address the diversity in practice in determining when there is
substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and when and how an entity must disclose certain relevant conditions and events. This update requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events,
considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). If such
conditions or events exist, an entity should disclose that there is substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be
issued), along with the principal conditions or events that raise substantial doubt, management’s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity’s ability to meet its obligations and
management’s plans that are intended to mitigate those conditions or events. This guidance will impact the disclosure and presentation of any substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, if such substantial doubt were to
exist. We adopted this guidance on December 31, 2016, and the adoption of the update did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures but would have an impact if such a substantial doubt were to
exist in the future.

In January 2017, the FASB issued an update that amended SEC guidance within the Accounting Standards Codification
related to disclosing the impact that recently issued accounting standards will have on a registrant’s financial statements when such standards are adopted in future periods. We have followed the guidance in this amendment within this section
and in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In May 2014, the FASB issued an update that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance as well as some cost recognition guidance. The
update requires that the recognition of revenue related to the transfer of goods or services to customers reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This update also requires new
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, information about contract balances and
performance obligations, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In July 2015, the FASB affirmed its proposal to defer the effective date until fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2017. The
guidance can be applied on a full retrospective or modified retrospective basis whereby the entity records a cumulative effect of initially applying this update at the date of initial application.

We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements, as well as the impact of our
selected transition method as we continue through the implementation process. In addition, we continue to monitor activity related to the new standard as well as working with various non-authoritative groups regarding industry clarifications and
interpretations, which may impact our considerations and conclusions. Significant areas of ongoing consideration include the impact of termination for convenience provisions on the duration of contracts and accounting for mobilization-related costs
and uninstalled materials. While we are still evaluating the requirements of this update, we currently do not expect the update to materially affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. This preliminary conclusion is based on
our belief that we will generally continue to recognize revenues from long-term service contracts over time as services are performed and the underlying obligation to the customer is fulfilled. We have identified and are in the process of
implementing changes to our processes and internal controls to meet the reporting and disclosure requirements of this update and will adopt this update effective January 1, 2018.

In July 2015, the FASB issued an update that requires inventory to be measured at the lower of either cost or net realizable value. When
evidence exists that the net realizable value of inventory is lower than its cost, the difference will be recognized as a loss in earnings in the period in which it occurs. The update is required to be adopted prospectively and is effective for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted. The adoption of the update is not anticipated to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or related
disclosures.

In January 2016, the FASB issued an update that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and
disclosure of financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for
financial statements of fiscal years or interim periods that have not been previously issued. We are evaluating the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and will adopt the new standard by January 1, 2018.

In February 2016, the FASB issued an update that requires companies to recognize on the balance sheet the contractual right of use assets and
liabilities corresponding to the rights and obligations created by lease contracts. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements of fiscal
years or interim periods that have not been previously issued. While we continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statements, it is anticipated that the adoption of the standard will materially impact our
statement of financial position.

In March 2016, the FASB issued an update that will amend the accounting for share-based payments in
several key areas, including the treatment and cash flow presentation of tax effects related to the settlement of share-based payments and the accounting for forfeitures of share-based awards. The new guidance will require companies with share-based
payments to record all tax effects related thereto at settlement (or expiration) through income tax expense on the statement of operations rather than through additional

paid-in

capital within



Index to Financial Statements

equity. This update will also require excess tax benefits to be classified as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than reclassified as a financing activity and will
require cash paid by an employer when withholding shares for the employee portion of taxes to be presented as a financing activity. The update also allows companies to either account for forfeitures of share-based payments as they occur or to
estimate forfeitures. This guidance is required to be applied prospectively except for the requirement to classify cash paid when withholding shares for taxes as a financing activity, which requires retrospective application. The update is effective
for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We will continue to estimate forfeitures of share-based payments. It is anticipated that we will experience increased volatility of income tax expense upon adoption of
this update.

In June 2016, the FASB issued an update that will change the way companies measure credit losses for most financial assets
and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The update will require companies to use an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost and to record allowances for

available-for-sale

(AFS) debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amounts. The update will also require disclosure of information regarding how a company developed its
allowance, including changes in the factors that influenced management’s estimate of expected credit losses and the reasons for those changes. Companies will apply this standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained
earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, although early adoption is permitted for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this authoritative guidance on our consolidated financial statements and will adopt this guidance by January 1, 2020.

In August 2016, the FASB issued an update intended to standardize the classification of certain transactions on the statement of cash flows.
These transactions include contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies and distributions received from equity method investments. The new standard is
effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although early adoption is permitted, and requires application using a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of
this authoritative guidance on our consolidated financial statements and will adopt this guidance by January 1, 2018.

In October
2016, the FASB issued an update that will require a reporting entity to recognize the tax expense from the sale of an asset in the seller’s tax jurisdiction when the transfer occurs, even though the

pre-tax

effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation. Any deferred tax asset that arises in the buyer’s jurisdiction would also be recognized at the time of the transfer. The new guidance
will not apply to intra-entity transfers of inventory. The income tax consequences from the sale of inventory from one member of a consolidated entity to another will continue to be deferred until the inventory is sold to a third party. The new
standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although early adoption is permitted. The modified retrospective method will be required for transition to the new guidance, with a
cumulative-effect adjustment recorded in retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this authoritative guidance on our consolidated financial statements and will adopt this
guidance by January 1, 2018.

In October 2016, the FASB issued an update that will amend the consolidation guidance related to how a
reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a VIE should treat indirect interests in the VIE held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of a
VIE. A reporting entity has an indirect interest in a VIE if it has a direct interest in a related party that, in turn, has a direct interest in the VIE. The new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted. Since we have already adopted a related update, we will be required to apply the amendments in this update retrospectively to all relevant prior periods beginning with the fiscal year in
which the amendments in the prior update were initially applied. We will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2017, and the adoption of the update is not anticipated to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or related
disclosures.



Index to Financial Statements

In November 2016, the FASB issued an update intended to standardize the classification of
restricted cash and cash equivalents transactions on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although early adoption is permitted. The retrospective
transition method will be required for this new guidance. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this authoritative guidance on our consolidated financial statements and will adopt this guidance by January 1, 2018.

In January 2017, the FASB issued an update intended to clarify the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluation of whether
transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The new definition requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable
asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the asset or group is not a business. The update will require that to be considered a business, a set of assets and activities must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that
together significantly contribute to the ability to create output. Additionally, the update will remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements in order to consider the set of assets and activities a business,
will provide more stringent criteria for sets without outputs and will narrow the definition of output. The new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although early adoption is
permitted for certain transactions. The prospective transition method will be required for this new guidance. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this authoritative guidance on our consolidated financial statements and will adopt
this guidance by January 1, 2018.

Also in January 2017, the FASB issued an update intended to simplify the subsequent measurement of
goodwill by eliminating the second step in the current

two-step

goodwill impairment test. The update will require an entity to perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair
value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity will recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, if applicable. Additionally, the update will eliminate the
requirement that a reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount perform a qualitative assessment and the second step of the

two-step

goodwill impairment test and will instead require disclosure of
the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets. This update is effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, although
early adoption is permitted for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The prospective transition method will be required for this new guidance. We are currently evaluating the potential
impact of this authoritative guidance on our consolidated financial statements and will adopt this guidance by January 1, 2020.

Critical
Accounting Policies

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are published and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented. We review all significant
estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on our beliefs and assumptions derived from information
available at the time such judgments and estimates are made. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from
those estimates. Management has reviewed its development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. We believe the following accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

Revenue Recognition

Through our Electric Power Infrastructure Services and Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segments, we design, install and maintain networks
for customers in the electric power and oil and gas industries. These



Index to Financial Statements

services may be provided pursuant to master service agreements, repair and maintenance contracts and fixed price and

non-fixed

price installation
contracts. Pricing under these contracts may be competitive unit price, cost-plus/hourly (or time and materials basis) or fixed price (or lump sum basis), and the final terms and prices of these contracts are frequently negotiated with the customer.
Under unit-based contracts, the utilization of an output-based measurement is appropriate for revenue recognition. Under these contracts, we recognize revenue as units are completed based on pricing established between us and the customer for each
unit of delivery, which best reflects the pattern in which the obligation to the customer is fulfilled. Under our cost-plus/hourly and time and materials type contracts, we recognize revenue on an input basis, as labor hours are incurred and
services are performed.

Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract. These contracts provide for a fixed amount of revenues for the entire project.
Such contracts provide that the customer accept completion of progress to date and compensate us for services rendered, which may be measured in terms of units installed, hours expended, costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract
costs or some other measure of progress. Contract costs include all direct materials, labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Much
of the material associated with our work is owner-furnished and is therefore not included in contract revenues and costs. The cost estimation process is based on professional knowledge and experience of our engineers, project managers and financial
professionals. Changes in job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence management’s assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts and therefore, our
profit recognition.

Actual revenues and project costs can vary, sometimes substantially, from previous estimates due to changes in a
variety of factors including unforeseen circumstances not included in our cost estimates or covered by our contracts for which we cannot obtain adequate compensation, including concealed or unknown environmental conditions; changes in the cost of
equipment, commodities, materials or labor; unanticipated costs or claims due to customer-caused delays, customer failure to provide required materials or equipment, errors in engineering, specifications or designs, project modifications, or
contract termination and our inability to obtain reimbursement for such costs or recover on such claims; weather conditions; and quality issues requiring rework or replacement. These factors, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price
contracts may cause actual revenues and gross profits for a project to differ from previous estimates and could result in reduced profitability or losses on projects. Changes in these factors may result in revisions to costs and income, and their
effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. These factors are routinely evaluated on a project by project basis throughout the project term, and the impact of corresponding revisions in management’s estimates of
contract value, contract cost and contract profit are recorded as necessary in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable
and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we experienced performance issues on
a power plant project in Alaska that resulted in an increase of the estimated total costs necessary to complete the project. During the construction and commissioning phases, the project experienced third party engineering deficiencies that changed
our planned scope of work and performance failures by other contractors operating onsite. These issues resulted in higher than expected production costs associated with quality deficiencies and a related impact on production sequencing.
Additionally, late in the second quarter of 2016, we experienced a claimed force majeure event that further disrupted project timing and provided the customer and its insurance providers with a notice of the event in order to seek schedule relief
and cost recovery. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized project losses of $54.8 million and $44.9 million. We are in the process of developing potential claims for damages that may have resulted from the
third party engineering and other contractor performance issues; however, no revenues or cost recovery has been reflected in our estimate of total project losses at December 31, 2016. This project had a contract value of $202 million at
December 31, 2016 and was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. As this project continues through the final close out



Index to Financial Statements

phase, it is possible that additional performance issues or other unforeseen circumstances could occur and result in the recognition of additional losses on this project; however, such amounts
cannot currently be estimated.

Our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016 were impacted by less than 5% as a result
of aggregate changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress at December 31, 2015. Included in the operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016 were losses from the project described above, offset by
the aggregate positive impact of numerous individually immaterial changes in project profitability generally due to better than expected performance for projects that were ongoing at December 31, 2015. Our operating results for the year ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014 were impacted by numerous individually immaterial changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress at December 31, 2014 and 2013; however, the aggregate impact was less than 5%.

The current asset “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents revenues recognized in
excess of amounts billed for fixed price contracts. The current liability “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized for fixed price contracts.

We may incur costs subject to change orders, whether approved or unapproved by the customer, and/or claims related to certain contracts. We
determine the probability that such costs will be recovered based upon evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer or verbal approvals. We treat items as costs of contract
performance in the period incurred if it is not probable that the costs will be recovered or will recognize revenue if it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be reliably estimated.

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had recognized revenues of approximately $137.8 million and $137.2 million related to
change orders and/or claims that had been included as contract price adjustments on certain contracts which were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business.

These aggregate contract price adjustments represent management’s best estimate of additional contract revenues which have been earned
and which management believes are probable of collection. The amounts ultimately realized by us upon final acceptance by our customers could be higher or lower than such estimated amounts; however, such amounts cannot currently be estimated.

Self-Insurance.

As discussed in

Liquidity and Capital Resources

—

Self-Insurance

, we are insured for
employer’s liability, workers’ compensation, auto liability, general liability, and group health claims.

Losses under all of
these insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to
assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known
facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the gross amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $218.2 million and $209.0 million, with $162.0 million and
$153.5 million considered to be long-term and included in other

non-current

liabilities. Related insurance recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $8.7 million and
$8.6 million, of which $0.4 million and $0.6 million were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $8.3 million and $8.0 million were included in other assets, net.

Valuation of Goodwill.

We have recorded goodwill in connection with our historical acquisitions of companies. Upon acquisition, these companies were either combined
into one of our existing operating units or managed on a stand-alone basis as an individual operating unit. Goodwill recorded in connection with these acquisitions is subject to an annual assessment for impairment, which we perform at the operating
unit level for each operating unit that carries a balance of goodwill. Each of our operating units is organized into one of two internal divisions: the Electric Power Infrastructure Services Division and the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services
Division. As most of the companies acquired by us provide multiple types of services for multiple types of customers, these divisional designations are based on the predominant type of work performed by each operating unit at the point in time the
divisional designation is made. Goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at the reporting unit level, which represents the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is
available. We have determined that our individual operating units represent our reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill impairments.

We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the

two-step

fair value-based impairment test described below. If we believe that, as a result of our qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its
carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. We can choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of our reporting units. We can also bypass the qualitative assessment
for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. Qualitative indicators including deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, declining
financial performance, or a sustained decrease in share price, among other things, may trigger the need for annual or interim impairment testing of goodwill associated with one or all of the reporting units.

Our goodwill impairment assessment is performed at

year-end,

or more frequently if events or
circumstances arise which indicate that goodwill may be impaired. For instance, a decrease in our market capitalization below book value, a significant change in business climate or loss of a significant customer, as well as the qualitative
indicators referenced above, may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of goodwill for one or all of our reporting units. The first step of the

two-step

fair value-based test involves comparing the
fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step compares the carrying amount of the reporting
unit’s goodwill to the implied fair value of its goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction to goodwill with a corresponding charge to operating expense.

We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighted combination of the discounted cash flow, market multiple and market
capitalization valuation approaches, with heavier weighting on the discounted cash flow method, as in management’s opinion, this method currently results in the most accurate calculation of a reporting unit’s fair value. Determining the
fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average costs of capital and future
market conditions, among others. We believe the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information, but variations in any of the assumptions could result in materially different
calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated.

Under the discounted cash flow method, we
determine fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted to present value using risk-adjusted industry discount rates, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of
return an outside investor would expect to earn. Cash flow projections are derived from budgeted amounts and operating forecasts (typically a

one-year

model) plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of
which are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash



Index to Financial Statements

flows are developed for each reporting unit using growth rates that management believes are reasonably likely to occur, along with a terminal value derived from the reporting unit’s earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The EBITDA multiples for each reporting unit are based on trailing twelve-month comparable industry data.

Under the market multiple and market capitalization approaches, we determine the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units by
applying transaction multiples to each reporting unit’s projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate with similar historical calculations using either a one, two or three year average. For the market capitalization approach, we add a
reasonable control premium, which is estimated as the premium that would be received in a sale of the reporting unit in an orderly transaction between market participants.

The projected cash flows and estimated levels of EBITDA by reporting unit were used to determine fair value under the three approaches
discussed herein. The following table presents the significant estimates used by management in determining the fair values of our reporting units at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:




Years of cash flows before terminal value

For recently acquired reporting units, a step one impairment test may indicate an implied fair value that is
substantially similar to the reporting unit’s carrying value. Such similarities in value are generally an indication that management’s estimates of future cash flows associated with the recently acquired reporting unit remain relatively
consistent with the assumptions that were used to derive its initial fair value.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, a

two-step

fair-value based goodwill impairment analysis was performed for each of our reporting units, and no reporting units were evaluated solely on a qualitative basis. Step one of the analysis indicated that the
implied fair value of each of our reporting units, other than recently acquired reporting units and the reporting units that recorded goodwill impairment charges in 2015, was substantially in excess of its carrying value.

As discussed generally above, when evaluating the 2016 step one impairment test results, management considered many factors in determining
whether or not an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit was reasonably likely to occur in future periods, including future market conditions and the economic environment in which our reporting units were operating. Additionally, management
considered the sensitivity of its fair value estimates to changes in certain valuation assumptions. After taking into account a 10% decrease in the fair value of each of our reporting units, two reporting units within our Oil and Gas Infrastructure
Services Division had fair values below their respective carrying values. We recorded asset impairment charges for these reporting units in 2015. The fair values determined in 2016 for these reporting units were consistent with the fair values
determined in 2015, accordingly the fair values approximate the current carrying values. Circumstances such as market declines, unfavorable economic conditions, the loss of a major customer or other factors could increase the risk of impairment of
goodwill in future periods.

If an operating unit experiences prolonged periods of declining revenues, operating margins or both, it may
be at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. Certain operating units have experienced declines over the short-term due to challenging macroeconomic conditions in certain geographic areas and low oil and natural gas prices, which
have negatively impacted customer spending and resulted in project cancellations and delays. Additionally, customer capital spending has been constrained as a result of an increasingly complex



Index to Financial Statements

regulatory and permitting environment. Certain operating units within our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division that primarily operate within the midstream and smaller-scale transmission
market have continued to be negatively impacted by these factors. Goodwill and intangible assets associated with the operating units within Quanta’s Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division that have been significantly impacted by the
factors mentioned above were approximately $68.0 million and $11.9 million at December 31, 2016. We monitor these conditions and others to determine if it is necessary to perform step one of the fair-value based impairment test for
one or more operating units prior to the annual impairment assessment. No impairment charges were recorded related to goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2016. Although we are not aware of circumstances that would lead to a goodwill
impairment at a reporting unit currently, circumstances such as a continued market decline, the loss of a major customer or other factors could impact the valuation of goodwill in the future.

The goodwill analysis performed for each reporting unit was based on estimates and comparisons obtained from the electric power and oil and
gas industries. We assigned a higher weighting to the discounted cash flow approach in all periods to reflect increased expectations of market value being determined from a “held and used” model. As stated previously, cash flows are
derived from budgeted amounts and operating forecasts that have been evaluated by management. In connection with the 2016 assessment, reporting unit growth rates during the cash flow projection period varied from negative 2% to positive 24%.

Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. Changes in our
judgments and projections could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair values of reporting units and intangible assets and could result in an impairment. Variances in the assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, cost
of capital, growth rates and acquisition multiples applied could have an impact on the assessment of impairments and the amount of any goodwill impairment charges recorded. For example, lower growth rates, lower acquisition multiples or higher costs
of capital assumptions would all individually lead to lower fair value assessments and potentially increased frequency or size of goodwill impairments. Any goodwill or other intangible impairments would be included in the consolidated statements of
operations.

Based on the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis, we compared the sum of fair values of our reporting units to our
market capitalization at December 31, 2016 and determined that the excess of the aggregate fair value of all reporting units to our market capitalization reflected a reasonable control premium. Our market capitalization at December 31,
2016 was approximately $5.27 billion, and our total stockholders’ equity was approximately $3.34 billion. If the price of our common stock were to decline to a level that causes our market capitalization to be lower than the value of
our stockholders’ equity, this would be another factor that could increase the risk of further impairment of goodwill in future periods. Increases in the carrying value of individual reporting units that may be indicated by our impairment tests
are not recorded, therefore we may record goodwill impairments in the future, even when the aggregate fair value of our reporting units as a whole may increase.

Our goodwill is included in multiple reporting units. Due to the cyclical nature of our business, and the other factors described under

Risk Factors

in Item 1A, the profitability of our individual reporting units may suffer from downturns in customer demand and other factors. These factors may have a disproportionate impact on the individual reporting units as compared
to Quanta as a whole and might adversely affect the fair value of individual reporting units. If material adverse conditions occur that impact our reporting units, our future estimates of fair value may not support the carrying amount of one or more
of our reporting units, and the related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered recoverable.

During the fourth
quarter of 2015, management concluded that goodwill was impaired at two reporting units in our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division and recorded a $39.8 million

non-cash

charge for the impairment
of goodwill, which primarily resulted from lower levels of expected activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and, to a lesser extent, due to the extended low commodity price environment with respect to certain directional drilling operations in
Australia.

Valuation of Other Intangibles.

Our intangible assets include customer relationships, backlog, trade names,

non-compete

agreements,
patented rights and developed technology, all subject to amortization. The value of customer relationships is estimated as of the date a business is acquired based on the

value-in-use

concept utilizing the income approach, specifically the excess earnings method. The excess earnings analysis consists of discounting to present value the
projected cash flows attributable to the customer relationships, with consideration given to customer contract renewals and estimated customer attrition rates, the importance or lack thereof of existing customer relationships to our business plan,
income taxes and required rates of return. We value backlog for acquired businesses as of the acquisition date based upon the contractual nature of the backlog within each service line, using the income approach to discount back to present value the
cash flows attributable to the backlog. The value of trade names is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. This approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company would be willing to pay a
royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this intangible asset.

We amortize intangible assets based upon the estimated
consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset or on a straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment
and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For instance, a significant change in business climate or a loss of a significant customer, among other things,
may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of intangible assets. An impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of $12.1 million related to customer relationships, trade names and

non-compete

agreement intangible assets. These intangible asset impairments primarily resulted from lower levels of expected activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and, to a lesser extent, due to the extended low
commodity price environment with respect to certain directional drilling operations in Australia. The two reporting units impacted also had related goodwill impairments, as discussed above, and are in our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services
Division.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets.

We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be realizable.
If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset group are compared to the asset group’s carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset group is necessary. This requires us to
make long-term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to the asset group subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and future market conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant
judgment, and our projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized. When an impairment exists, the difference between the fair value of such asset group and its carrying value would be expensed and reflected in operating income (loss) in
the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, we estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets and periodically review these estimates to determine whether these lives are appropriate.

We also recorded asset impairments primarily related to certain international renewable energy services operations of $8.0 million in
2016 and $6.6 million in 2015. The 2016 impairment was primarily due to a pending disposition of certain international renewable energy services operations, and the 2015 impairment was based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows for
the asset group as compared to their carrying value.

Current and Long-Term Accounts and Notes Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts.

We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account or note receivable is considered doubtful,
and receivables are written off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible. Inherent



Index to Financial Statements

in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates regarding, among other factors, our customer’s access to capital, our customer’s willingness
or ability to pay, general economic and market conditions, the ongoing relationship with the customer and uncertainties related to the resolution of disputed matters. We consider accounts receivable delinquent after 30 days but do not generally
include delinquent accounts in our analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts unless the accounts receivable have been outstanding for at least 90 days. In addition to balances that have been outstanding for 90 days or more, we also include
accounts receivable balances that relate to customers in bankruptcy or with other known difficulties in our analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Material changes in our customers’ business or cash flows, which may be impacted by
negative economic and market conditions, could affect our ability to collect amounts due from them. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had allowances for doubtful accounts on current receivables of approximately $2.8 million and
$5.2 million. Long-term accounts receivable are included within other assets, net on our consolidated balance sheets.

Should
customers experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy, or should anticipated recoveries relating to receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations fail to materialize, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses
in excess of current allowances provided.

The balances billed but not paid by customers pursuant to retainage provisions in certain
contracts are generally due upon completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer. Based on our experience with similar contracts in recent years, the majority of the retainage balances at each balance sheet date are expected to be
collected within the next twelve months. Current retainage balances as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $231.0 million and $250.1 million and were included in accounts receivable. Retainage balances with settlement
dates beyond the next twelve months were included in other assets, net, and as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $5.2 million and $4.5 million.

Within accounts receivable, we recognize unbilled receivables in circumstances such as when revenues have been earned and recorded but the
amount cannot be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date; costs have been incurred but are yet to be billed under cost-reimbursement type contracts; or amounts arise from routine lags in billing (for example, work completed one
month but not billed until the next month). These balances do not include revenues accrued for work performed under fixed-price contracts as these amounts are recorded as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts.
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the balances of unbilled receivables included in accounts receivable were approximately $206.8 million and $233.6 million.

Income Taxes.

We
follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets, and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled.

We regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain. The estimation of
required valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible. We consider projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. If actual future taxable income differs from our estimates, we may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent estimated.

We record reserves for income taxes related to certain tax positions in those instances where we consider it more likely than not that
additional taxes may be due in excess of amounts reflected on income tax returns filed. When recording reserves for expected tax consequences of uncertain positions, we assume that taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all
relevant facts. We continually review exposure to additional tax



Index to Financial Statements

obligations, and as further information is known or events occur, changes in tax reserves may be recorded. To the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on any
underpayment of income tax, such amounts have been accrued and included in the provision for income taxes.

As of December 31, 2016,
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions was $35.2 million, a decrease from December 31, 2015 of $19.3 million. This decrease in unrecognized tax benefits resulted primarily from a
$23.4 million decrease due to expiration of certain federal and state statute of limitations, partially offset by a $4.2 million increase due to tax positions to be taken for 2016. Although the IRS completed its examination related to tax
years 2010, 2011 and 2012 during 2016, certain subsidiaries remain under examination by various U.S. state, Canadian and other foreign tax authorities for multiple periods. We believe it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months
unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $12.3 million as a result of settlement of these examinations or as a result of the expiration of certain statute of limitations periods.

U.S. federal and state and foreign income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, we are required to make
many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our tax positions that could materially affect amounts recognized in our future consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations and comprehensive income.

Outlook

We believe there are growth
opportunities across all the industries we serve and continue to have a positive long-term outlook. Overall, favorable end-market drivers have spurred demand for infrastructure services in both our electric power infrastructure and oil and gas
infrastructure segments, and we believe both segments are entering a renewed multiyear upcycle. We are focused on long-term growth and continuing to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue
opportunities designed to enhance Quanta’s core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta’s unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset will continue to
provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders.

However, we and our customers continue to operate in a
fluid business environment, with gradual improvement in the United States and Canadian economies yet continuing uncertainty in the marketplace overall. Certain of our end markets remain challenged but are showing signs of potential recovery as oil
and natural gas prices and the broader energy market has recovered and largely stabilized from the significant decline that began in mid-2014. In particular, the Canadian economy has been affected due to the influence of the energy industry on the
country’s economy, which in turn has adversely impacted both our electric power and oil and gas infrastructure services operations in Canada. However, we believe our Canadian operations have stabilized and there are signs of recovery. Our
customers also face stringent regulatory and environmental requirements, which have resulted in construction delays in some cases, particularly for larger electric transmission and pipeline projects. While these various challenges have
negatively affected our operations in the past and may in the future, we believe that our financial and operational strength will enable us to manage these challenges and uncertainties, and we remain optimistic about our near-term and long-term
opportunities.

Electric Power Infrastructure Services Segment

Certain portions of the North American electric grid are aging and require significant upgrades, maintenance and expansion to meet current and
future demands for reliable power delivery. Over the past several years, many utilities across North America have begun to implement plans to upgrade their transmission systems in order to improve reliability and reduce congestion. Among other
things, these activities include new construction, structure change-outs, line upgrades and maintenance projects on many transmission systems. In addition, state renewable portfolio standards, which set required or voluntary standards for how much
power is to be generated from renewable energy sources, can result in the need for additional transmission lines and substations to



Index to Financial Statements

transport the power from these facilities, which are often in remote locations, to demand centers. Other factors, such as the reliability standards issued by the North American Electric
Reliability Corporation and other regulatory actions, are also driving transmission system upgrades and expansions. We believe these factors create significant opportunities for our transmission infrastructure services.

Demand for electricity in North America is expected to grow over the long term. Certain segments of the North American electric power grid are
not adequate to efficiently serve the power needs of the future. The electric power grid is aging and, in some cases, lacks redundancy. The increasing demand for electricity, coupled with these issues, has affected and will continue to affect
reliability, requiring utilities to upgrade and expand their existing transmission and distribution systems. Current federal legislation also requires the power industry to meet federal reliability standards for its transmission and distribution
systems. We expect these system upgrades will result in increased spending and increased demand for our services over the long term.

As
demand for power grows, the need for new power generation facilities is expected to grow. The development of new traditional power generation facilities, as well as renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and certain types of natural gas
generation facilities, requires new or expanded transmission infrastructure to transport power to demand centers. Renewable energy sources in particular often require significant transmission infrastructure due to their remote location. As a result,
we anticipate that future development of new power generation will lead to increased demand over the long term for our electric transmission design and construction services, as well as our substation engineering and installation services.

The significant improvement in access to natural gas resources from unconventional shale formations in the United States and Canada, driven by
technological advancements, has dramatically increased the near- and long-term supply of natural gas in North America. This increase in supply has also resulted in low natural gas prices for the past several years and the anticipation that natural
gas prices will remain at lower levels going forward. As a result, it is anticipated that the amount of electricity generated by natural gas powered plants will increase and, for the foreseeable future, the majority of fossil fuel generation
facilities built in North America will be fueled by natural gas. Further, the Environmental Protection Agency has implemented certain emissions regulations that are resulting in the development of natural gas generation facilities to replace coal
generation plants that are being retired in order to comply with the new regulations. These dynamics are anticipated to result in the need for additional North American transmission and substation infrastructure to interconnect new natural gas fired
generation facilities. It is also anticipated that modifications to and reengineering of existing transmission and substation infrastructure will be required in the event existing coal and nuclear generation facilities are retired or shut down.

We consider renewable energy, including solar and wind generation facilities, to be an ongoing opportunity for our engineering, project
management and installation services. Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the goal of reducing reliance on power generation from fossil fuels, are creating the demand for more renewable energy sources. Renewable portfolio standards,
which mandate that renewable energy constitute a specified percentage of a utility’s power generation by a specified date, exist in many states. We believe that our comprehensive services, industry knowledge and experience in the design,
installation and maintenance of renewable energy facilities will enable us to support our customers’ renewable energy efforts.

The
economic feasibility of renewable energy projects, and therefore the attractiveness of investment in such projects, may depend on the availability of tax incentive programs or the ability of the project developer to take advantage of such
incentives. There is no assurance that the government will extend existing tax incentives or create new incentive or funding programs. Although we see development of renewable energy projects, primarily utility-scale solar facilities, which could
create increased demand for our engineering, procurement and construction services, we believe there is some uncertainty whether these projects will advance to award and construction.



Index to Financial Statements

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued FERC Order No. 1000 to promote more
efficient and cost-effective development of new transmission facilities. The order establishes transmission planning and cost allocation requirements intended to facilitate multi-state electric transmission lines and to encourage competition by
removing, under certain conditions, federal rights of first refusal from FERC-approved tariffs and agreements. In the short-term, we believe implementation of and compliance with the order has created some confusion and uncertainty for utilities and
regulators, which has adversely impacted the timing of some potential transmission projects and spending, and that modifications may be necessary to spur certain intended transmission investment. If these challenges are resolved, we believe FERC
Order No. 1000 has the potential to favorably impact electric transmission line development over time, particularly for large, high-voltage electric transmission projects.

Several existing, pending or proposed legislative or regulatory actions may also positively affect demand for the services provided by this
segment in the long term, particularly in connection with electric power infrastructure and renewable energy spending. For example, legislative or regulatory action that alleviates some of the siting and

right-of-way

challenges that impact transmission projects would potentially accelerate future transmission line construction. We also anticipate increased infrastructure spending by our customers as a result
of regulation requiring the power industry to meet federal reliability standards for its transmission and distribution systems and providing incentives to the industry to invest in and improve maintenance on its systems.

We believe that utilities remain committed to the expansion and strengthening of their transmission infrastructure with planning, engineering
and funding for many of their projects in place. The regulatory and environmental permitting processes remain a hurdle for some proposed transmission and renewable energy projects, and these factors continue to create uncertainty as to timing of
this spending. In the near-term, our electric power infrastructure services operations have been impacted by regulatory delays, particularly for large transmission projects. However, we expect many of these projects to move forward over a multi-year
period. The timing and scope of projects can also be affected by other factors such as siting,

right-of-way

and unfavorable economic and market conditions. We anticipate
many of these issues to be overcome and spending on transmission projects to be active over the next few years. We currently have a number of these projects underway, and we expect this segment’s backlog to remain strong throughout 2017.

In the near-term, margins in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment have experienced pressure due to increased transmission
contractor availability, as construction of several large, high-voltage transmission projects has been delayed due to the challenging regulatory approval and permitting environment. We believe these large transmission projects have been delayed and
not canceled and that demand for our transmission services will remain strong over the next several years. As a result, we believe there have been excess transmission contractor resources in the small and medium size transmission marketplace due to
the delay of large transmission projects, which has resulted in increased competition and pricing pressure for those services in some areas. These factors, in addition to challenging regional economic conditions, have impacted our Canadian
operations in particular. Over the past few quarters, we believe these competitive pressures and Canadian economic conditions have begun to stabilize. We will remain focused on maintaining our pricing discipline and believe competitive pressures
could recede further as large, high-voltage transmission projects move forward and the small and medium size transmission market continues to grow and/or contractors adjust further to the current environment.

We benefited from increases in distribution spending throughout the last several years, despite continued economic and political
uncertainties. We believe there is an ongoing need for utilities to sustain investment in their distribution systems in order to properly maintain system reliability and capacity. In addition, a number of utilities are implementing system upgrades
or “hardening” programs in response to severe weather events that have occurred over the past few years, which is also increasing distribution investment in some regions of the United States. We also anticipate that utilities will continue
to integrate “smart grid” technologies into their distribution systems over time to improve grid management and create efficiencies.



Index to Financial Statements

The need to ensure available specialized labor resources for projects also drives strategic
relationships with customers. In addition, several industry and market trends are prompting customers to seek ongoing service arrangements. These trends include an aging utility workforce and labor availability issues, increasing pressure to reduce
costs and improve reliability, and increasing duration and complexity of customer capital programs. Due to these and other factors, we believe customer demand for labor resources will continue to increase, possibly outpacing the supply of industry
resources. As a result, we believe the number of opportunities for strategic partnerships is growing.

Certain international regions
present significant opportunities for growth over time across many of our operations. We are evaluating ways in which we can strategically apply our expertise in various foreign countries where infrastructure enhancements are increasingly important.
For example, we are actively pursuing opportunities in growth markets where we can leverage our technology or proprietary work methods, such as our energized services, to establish a presence. In Canada, we are leveraging our electric power
infrastructure services resources, relationships and reputation to expand and grow our telecommunication infrastructure services operations. In addition, over the last several years we have successfully developed our telecommunication infrastructure
services operations in several Latin American countries that offer attractive growth opportunities. We believe the success of these efforts could enable us to expand our infrastructure services to electric power and other services in Latin America.

Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Segment

We continue to see growth opportunities in our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment, primarily in the installation and maintenance of
larger pipeline and related facilities, as well as pipeline integrity, natural gas distribution systems and specialty services such as horizontal directional drilling. In certain areas of North America, the existing pipeline system infrastructure is
insufficient to support future development of unconventional shale formations and the Canadian oil sands. We believe that the development of such resources, though facing challenges in the near term, may continue over the long term and that building
this infrastructure would take a number of years, which we expect should increase demand for our services over the long term.

Despite our
positive long-term outlook, a challenging regulatory and permitting environment has caused delays of some larger pipeline projects during the past several years. These dynamics resulted in below average larger pipeline construction opportunities for
us and the industry. The market for larger pipeline projects, in our view, began to improve in late 2013, though regulatory delays for some projects have moderated the pace of recovery. These project approval delays have negatively impacted our Oil
and Gas Infrastructure Services segment margins, in part as a result of our inability to adequately cover certain fixed costs. Margins for larger pipeline projects are also subject to significant performance risk, which can arise from adverse
weather conditions, challenging geography, customer decisions and crew productivity. Our specific opportunities in the larger pipeline business are sometimes difficult to predict because of the seasonality of the bidding and construction cycles
within the industry.

A number of larger pipeline projects from the North American shale formations and Canadian oil sands to power
plants, refineries and other demand centers are in various stages of development. Most of the larger pipeline projects we are working on, have in backlog or see as future potential opportunities are driven by natural gas production and demand.
Further, the abundant natural gas supply combined with attractive prices should increase demand for natural gas in the future. The U.S. Energy Information Administration has stated that the number of natural

gas-fired

power plants built will increase significantly over the next two decades. Power generation from renewable energy sources also continues to increase and become a larger percentage of the overall power
generation mix. We also believe natural gas will be the fuel of choice to provide backup power generation during times when renewable energy sources are not available. These factors are resulting in increased development of natural gas power
generation and demand for natural gas production over the long term, which is creating a need for additional pipeline infrastructure to connect natural gas supplies to demand centers.



Index to Financial Statements

In addition, the abundance, low price and long-term supply of North American natural gas has
resulted in efforts to develop liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities in the United States, Canada and Australia, which could provide pipeline and related facilities development opportunities for us. Natural gas prices in various
international markets are significantly higher than North American natural gas prices, making the economics of exporting North American natural gas to international markets attractive. A number of LNG export facilities are in various stages of
planning, permitting and development in the United States and Canada. Although we cannot be certain how many of these projects will move forward, as they could be affected by changing pricing and economic conditions, we believe our comprehensive
service offerings and broad geographic presence enable us to competitively pursue pipeline and related facilities infrastructure opportunities that become available.

We also see a number of larger oil pipeline project opportunities, particularly in Canada. Although many of these projects are still
developing, a significant number of projects have been awarded to us and other pipeline contractors and are moving towards construction. Given the costs and time required to bring a larger pipeline project from conception to construction, we
believe many of our customers view such projects as important, strategic pieces of infrastructure, have a long-term perspective regarding their needs, and are not primarily influenced by short term commodity price fluctuations.

In certain areas of North America, pipeline takeaway capacity is not sufficient to economically move oil from production areas to demand
centers for current and/or anticipated future oil production. As a result, certain proposed larger oil pipeline projects are being developed and have secured producers under contractual arrangements, making these projects economically viable despite
the decline in oil prices. Several of these projects are intended to move oil from the Canadian oil sands to the east and west coast of Canada in order to access demand markets in Europe, Asia and other areas.

While there is risk that these projects will not move forward or could be delayed, we are encouraged by the proposed larger pipeline
development plans and the successful progression of certain larger pipeline projects, which is indicative of an improved and favorable large pipeline market over the next several years in North America. We expect to execute on a significant number
of larger pipeline projects during 2017, though this activity could be more pronounced in the first half of 2017. However, if oil and natural gas prices decline further or remain at lower levels for a prolonged period, our outlook may change and
demand for our oil and natural gas infrastructure services could be materially impacted.

We also believe there are growth opportunities
for some of our other pipeline services, including pipeline integrity, rehabilitation and replacement services, over the long-term. The U.S. Department of Transportation has implemented regulatory legislation through the Pipeline and Hazardous
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) relating to pipeline integrity requirements. PHMSA continues to develop, propose and implement additional safety and pipeline integrity regulation for liquid and natural gas pipelines. Once finalized and
implemented, the proposed new regulations would strengthen requirements for safety, operation, inspection and maintenance of pipelines and provide pipeline operators with regulatory certainty.

Further, as pipeline integrity testing requirements increase in stringency and frequency, we believe more information will be gathered about
the condition of pipeline infrastructure in the United States, which could result in an increase in spending by our customers on pipeline integrity initiatives. We also operate an engineering, research and development business that develops and owns
pipeline inspection tools. We believe our ability to offer a complete pipeline integrity turnkey solution to pipeline companies and gas utilities positions us to take advantage of available opportunities.

We are also experiencing an increase in demand for our natural gas distribution services as a result of improved economic conditions, lower
natural gas prices and a significant need to upgrade and replace aging infrastructure. A number of states, particularly states in the northeast United States that have cities and areas with older natural gas distribution infrastructure, have
approved and are implementing regulations and multi-year programs to replace cast iron, wrought iron and bare steel natural gas infrastructure, which is prone to failure



Index to Financial Statements

with age, with modern and safer pipe material. We expect this to take an extended period of time, which should provide attractive growth opportunities for this part of our business.

Over the past several years, we have expanded our service offerings into Canada and Australia, which have different market drivers and
seasonality as compared to the United States. In addition, our previous acquisitions of companies that provide pipeline logistics services to the natural gas and oil industry in the United States and specialty services to the offshore oil and gas
industry further enhance the segment’s service offerings, customer base and end markets.

The oil and gas industry is highly cyclical
and subject to volatility as a result of fluctuations in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil prices. In the past, sustained periods of low prices for these products negatively impacted the development of related natural resources and
infrastructure. The challenging energy market environment over the past few years has adversely impacted demand for some of our services, primarily infrastructure services in Australia, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. Exploration and production
companies and midstream companies also significantly reduced capital spending in response to the decline in oil and natural gas prices. Even though prices have recovered to a limited degree since early 2016, another meaningful decline or increased
uncertainty could result in additional reductions in capital spending. Reduced capital spending on larger pipeline, gas gathering and compressor systems and other related infrastructure would result in less demand for our services. In particular,
the demand for infrastructure services in areas where the price of oil is influential, such as Australia, the Canadian Oil Sands, certain oil-driven shale formations in the United States and offshore oil resources in the Gulf of Mexico, has been
materially and adversely impacted by low oil prices. These markets could remain challenged if oil prices remain at lower levels. We believe that, over the long term, the market will correct oversupply imbalances, and as a result, oil prices could
continue to recover. The timing of any further recovery, however, is uncertain.

Overall, we remain optimistic about this segment’s
operations going forward. From a near- and medium-term perspective, we continue to believe that larger pipeline opportunities can provide significant profitability, although these projects and the profits they generate are often subject to more
cyclicality and execution risk than our other service offerings. We have also taken steps to diversify our operations in this segment through other services, such as pipeline integrity, pipeline logistics, and offshore specialty services.

Conclusion

Though
not without risks and challenges, we believe there are growth opportunities across all the industries we serve and continue to have a positive long-term outlook. Favorable end market drivers continue to spur demand for our infrastructure services,
and we believe both our electric power infrastructure and oil and gas infrastructure segments are entering a renewed multiyear upcycle.

We are benefiting from utilities’ increased spending on projects to upgrade and expand their electric power transmission infrastructure
in order to improve system reliability and deliver renewable electricity from new generation sources to demand centers. Favorable industry legislation and regulations are also creating incentives and a positive environment for utilities to invest in
their electrical infrastructure, particularly transmission infrastructure. Existing environmental regulations concerning fossil fuel power generation emissions create opportunities for transmission lines to be updated, rebuilt or replaced due to
“coal to gas” facility replacements. We also expect utilities to outsource more of their work to companies like us, due in part to the challenges associated with their aging workforce. We believe that we remain the partner of choice for
many utilities in need of broad infrastructure expertise, specialty equipment and workforce resources, particularly as capital budgets and infrastructure projects have become larger and more complex.

Though gradual recovery and stabilization of oil and natural gas prices has had a positive effect on our business, some of the markets and
services in our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment remain challenged. This dynamic could continue should natural gas and oil prices further decline or remain at lower levels. However, we believe long-term dynamics create growth
opportunities going forward. We believe that our



Index to Financial Statements

overall size and breadth of service offerings provide competitive advantages that allow us to leverage opportunities that arise in connection with development and production of resources from
North American unconventional shale formations, the Canadian oil sands and coal seam gas and unconventional shale formations in Australia. We experienced backlog growth in 2016 primarily driven by new larger natural gas pipeline project awards and
believe there could be additional larger pipeline project activity over the next several years. We also believe that our strategy to pursue midstream gathering system opportunities in certain unconventional shale formations in the United States, as
well as the anticipated increase in demand for our pipeline integrity, rehabilitation and replacement services, and other services in adjacent markets, will create attractive growth potential for us and also further diversify our service offerings
in both the near and long term.

Demand for our electric and natural gas distribution services has increased over the past several years
as the economy has stabilized and spending on maintenance to improve reliability has returned. We are optimistic that continued implementation of electric distribution reliability programs and the potential for improvement in the housing market will
facilitate continued growth in demand for our electric distribution services. Gas distribution spending has been driven primarily by improving economic conditions and the lower cost of natural gas, and more recently by efforts to replace cast iron,
wrought iron and bare steel distribution pipeline systems.

For both our electric power and oil and gas infrastructure customers, we have
the financial strength to selectively and strategically provide financing solutions that could help facilitate development of energy infrastructure projects and potentially create construction backlog for us. We believe changing regulations,
industry trends and the increasing size of energy infrastructure projects and programs are creating and will continue to create such opportunities, and our ability to selectively partner with customers in this manner is a competitive advantage.

Competitive pricing environments, project delays and restrictive regulatory requirements have negatively impacted our margins in the past and
could affect our margins in the future. Additionally, margins may be negatively impacted on a quarterly basis due to adverse weather conditions, as well as timing of project starts or completions and other factors as previously described in

Understanding Margins

. We continue to focus on the elements of the business that are largely within our control, including costs, the margins we accept on projects, collecting receivables, ensuring quality service, rightsizing initiatives as
needed to match the markets we serve, and safely executing on the projects we are awarded.

Capital expenditures for 2017 related to
continuing operations are expected to be between $210 million to $225 million. We expect 2017 capital expenditures to be funded substantially from cash on hand, internal cash flows and borrowings under our credit facility.

We also continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions and similar investments to broaden our customer base, expand our geographic area
of operation, grow our portfolio of services and increase opportunities across our operations. We believe that additional attractive acquisition candidates exist primarily as a result of the highly fragmented nature of the industry, the inability of
many companies to expand and modernize due to capital constraints, and the desire of owners for liquidity. We also believe that our financial strength, entrepreneurial operating model and experienced management team are attractive to acquisition
candidates.

We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize upon opportunities and trends in the industries we serve because of our
full-service operations with broad geographic reach, our financial strength and our technical expertise. Additionally, we believe the industry opportunities and trends discussed herein will increase the demand for our services over the long term,
although the actual timing, magnitude and impact of these opportunities and trends on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows are difficult to predict.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about M

arket Risk

Our primary exposure to market risk relates to unfavorable changes in concentration of credit risk, interest rates and currency exchange rates.

Credit Risk.

We are subject to concentrations of credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalents and our net receivable
position with customers, which includes amounts related to billed and unbilled accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts net of advanced billings with the same customer. Substantially all of
our cash and cash equivalents are managed by what we believe to be high credit quality financial institutions. In accordance with our investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest cash and cash equivalents in a diversified
portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality investments, which primarily include interest-bearing demand deposits, money market investments and money market mutual funds with original maturities of three months or less. Although we do not
currently believe the principal amounts of these investments are subject to any material risk of loss, changes in economic conditions could impact the interest income we receive from these investments. In addition, as we grant credit under normal
payment terms, generally without collateral, we are subject to potential credit risk related to our customers’ ability to pay for services provided. This risk may be heightened as a result of the depressed economic and financial market
conditions that have existed in recent years. However, we believe the concentration of credit risk related to billed and unbilled receivables and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts is limited because of the
diversity of our customers. We perform ongoing credit risk assessments of our customers and financial institutions and in some cases we obtain collateral or other security from our customers.

Interest Rate Risk.

As of December 31, 2016, we had no derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. As such, we
were exposed to earnings and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our long-term obligations. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of our variable rate debt of $352.8 million approximated book value. Our
weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 2.1%. The annual effect on our pretax earnings of a hypothetical 50 basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates would be
approximately $1.8 million based on our December 31, 2016 balance of variable rate debt.



Index to Financial Statements

Foreign Currency Risk.

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the majority of our
operations, which are primarily located within the United States. The functional currency for our foreign operations, which are primarily located in Canada and Australia, is typically the currency of the country in which the foreign operating unit
is located. Accordingly, our financial performance is subject to fluctuation due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. During 2016, revenues from our foreign operations accounted for 20.8% of our consolidated
revenues. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2016 caused an approximate decrease of $41 million in foreign revenues compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015 caused an approximate decrease of $227 million in foreign revenues compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.

We are also subject to foreign currency risk with respect to sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the
respective functional currencies of our operating units. To minimize the risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our foreign currency risk on a cash flow basis. There
were no outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2016.

We also have foreign exchange risk related to cash
and cash equivalents in foreign banks. Based on the balance of cash and cash equivalents in foreign banks of $92.7 million as of December 31, 2016, an assumed 5% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in a fair value decline
of $4.6 million. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

Management’s Report on Financial Information and Procedures

The accompanying financial statements of Quanta Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries were prepared by management. These financial statements
were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, applying certain estimates and judgments as required.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our
internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives
will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the
realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurances and may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and
procedures may deteriorate.

The effectiveness of Quanta Services, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2016 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears herein.



Index to Financial Statements

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2016 excluded the five acquisitions we completed in 2016. Such exclusion was in accordance with SEC guidance that an assessment of recently acquired businesses may be omitted in management’s report on internal
control over financial reporting, provided the acquisition took place within twelve months of management’s evaluation. These acquisitions comprised approximately 1.3% and 0.9% of our consolidated assets and revenues as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2016.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Quanta Services, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash
flows and equity, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Quanta Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit
of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded its 2016 acquisitions from its
assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 because these acquisitions were made by the Company through purchase business combinations during 2016. We have also excluded the Company’s 2016 acquisitions
from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. The 2016 acquisitions of the Company and its related subsidiaries are wholly owned subsidiaries of the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION:

Quanta Services, Inc. (Quanta) is a leading provider of
specialty contracting services, offering infrastructure solutions primarily to the electric power and oil and gas industries in the United States, Canada and Australia and select other international markets. Quanta reports its results under two
reportable segments: (1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services and (2) Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services.

Electric
Power Infrastructure Services Segment

The Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment provides comprehensive network solutions
to customers in the electric power industry. Services performed by the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power transmission and distribution
infrastructure and substation facilities along with other engineering and technical services. This segment also provides emergency restoration services, including the repair of infrastructure damaged by inclement weather, the energized installation,
maintenance and upgrade of electric power infrastructure utilizing unique bare hand and hot stick methods and Quanta’s proprietary robotic arm technologies, and the installation of “smart grid” technologies on electric power networks.
In addition, this segment designs, installs and maintains renewable energy generation facilities, consisting of solar, wind and certain types of natural gas generation facilities, and related switchyards and transmission infrastructure. To a lesser
extent, this segment provides services such as the construction of electric power generation facilities, the design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, the installation of traffic networks and cable and control
systems for light rail lines and ancillary telecommunication infrastructure services.

Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Segment

The Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment provides comprehensive network solutions to customers involved in the development
and transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline products. Services performed by the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design, installation, repair and maintenance of pipeline transmission and distribution
systems, gathering systems, production systems, storage systems and compressor and pump stations, as well as related trenching, directional boring and mechanized welding services. In addition, this segment’s services include pipeline
protection, integrity testing, rehabilitation and replacement, and fabrication of pipeline support systems and related structures and facilities. We also serve the offshore and inland water energy markets, primarily providing services to oil and gas
exploration platforms, including mechanical installation (or

“hook-ups”),

electrical and instrumentation,

pre-commissioning

and commissioning, coatings,
fabrication and marine asset repair. To a lesser extent, this segment designs, installs and maintains fueling systems, as well as water and sewer infrastructure.

Acquisitions

During 2016, Quanta completed five acquisitions. The results of four of the acquired companies are generally included in Quanta’s Electric
Power Infrastructure Services segment. These companies included an electrical infrastructure services company located in Australia, a utility contracting company located in Canada, a full service medium- and high-voltage powerline contracting
company located in the United States and a telecommunications company located in Canada. Quanta also acquired a pipeline service contractor located in the United States, the results of which are generally included in Quanta’s Oil and Gas
Infrastructure Services segment. As these transactions were effective during 2016, the results have been included in Quanta’s consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective dates of acquisition. These acquisitions should enable
Quanta to further enhance its service offerings in the United States, Australia and Canada.



Index to Financial Statements

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

)

During 2015, Quanta acquired 11 companies. The results of eight of the acquired companies are
generally included in Quanta’s Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. These companies include a foundation services company located in the United States, an electrical contracting company located in the United States, an electrical
engineering company located in Australia, a powerline construction company located in the United States, an engineering company located in Canada, an engineering, procurement and construction services company based in the United States, an
underground construction contracting company located in Canada, and a supplier and material procurement specialist for the power and utility industry in Canada. The results of the remaining three acquired companies are generally included in
Quanta’s Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment. These companies include a company that services above-ground storage tanks in the United States, an underground utility distribution contractor that provides services to gas and electric
utilities in Canada, and a company that specializes in the engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning of compression and surface facilities for the high pressure gas industry in Australia.

During 2014, Quanta completed nine acquisitions, which enabled Quanta to further enhance its electric power and oil and gas infrastructure
service offerings in the United States and Canada and expand its capabilities in Australia to include electric power infrastructure service offerings. These acquisitions included four electric power infrastructure services companies located in
Canada; two oil and gas infrastructure services businesses located in Canada; an electric power infrastructure services company located in Australia; a U.S. based general engineering and construction company specializing in hydrant fueling,
waterfront and utility construction for the U.S. Department of Defense the results of which are generally included in Quanta’s Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment; and a geotechnical and geological engineering services company based in
the United States the results of which are generally included in Quanta’s Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.

Disposition — Fiber Optic Licensing Operations

On April 29, 2015, Quanta entered into a stock purchase agreement with Crown Castle International Corp. (Crown Castle) pursuant to which
Quanta agreed to sell its fiber optic licensing operations. The purchase agreement contained customary representations and warranties, covenants and indemnities. On August 4, 2015, Quanta completed the sale for a purchase price of approximately
$1 billion in cash, resulting in

after-tax

net proceeds of approximately $848 million. In the third quarter of 2015, Quanta recognized a net of tax gain of approximately $171 million. Quanta has
presented the results of operations, financial position, cash flows and disclosures of the fiber optic licensing operations as discontinued operations for all periods in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These results were included
in Quanta’s Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment prior to the second quarter of 2015.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Quanta include the accounts of Quanta Services, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
which are also referred to as its operating units. The consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of certain of Quanta’s investments in joint ventures, which are either consolidated or proportionately consolidated, as discussed
in the following summary of significant accounting policies. Investments in affiliated entities in which Quanta does not have a controlling financial interest, but over which Quanta has significant influence, usually because Quanta holds a voting
interest of between 20% and 50%, are accounted for using the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to Quanta include Quanta
Services, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.



Index to Financial Statements

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

)

Use of Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management in
determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during
the periods presented. Quanta reviews all significant estimates affecting its consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on
Quanta’s beliefs and assumptions derived from information available at the time such judgments and estimates are made. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements.
Estimates are primarily used in Quanta’s assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of assets, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill, other intangibles and long-lived asset impairments, equity
and other investments, loan receivables, purchase price allocations, liabilities for self-insured and other claims and guarantees, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, revenue recognition for construction contracts inclusive of
contractual change orders and claims, share-based compensation, operating results of reportable segments, as well as the provision for income taxes and the calculation of uncertain tax positions.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Quanta had cash and cash equivalents of $112.2 million and $128.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Cash consisting of
interest-bearing demand deposits is carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Quanta considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents, which are carried at
fair value. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash equivalents were $8.8 million and $1.4 million and consisted primarily of money market investments and money market mutual funds and are discussed further in

Fair Value
Measurements

below. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash and cash equivalents held in domestic bank accounts were approximately $19.5 million and $16.1 million, and cash and cash equivalents held in foreign bank accounts were
approximately $92.7 million and $112.7 million. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash and cash equivalents held by Quanta’s investments in joint ventures, which are either consolidated or proportionately consolidated, were
approximately $11.5 million and $24.9 million, of which $10.0 million and $11.9 million related to domestic joint ventures. Cash and cash equivalents held by the joint ventures are available to support the operations of the
related joint ventures, and Quanta does not have access to that cash for its other operations. Under the terms of the partnership agreements, Quanta generally has no right to the joint ventures’ cash other than participating in distributions
and in the event of dissolution.

Current and Long-Term Accounts and Notes Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Quanta provides an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account or note receivable is considered doubtful, and
receivables are written off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible. Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates regarding, among other factors, the customer’s access to capital,
the customer’s willingness or ability to pay, general economic and market conditions, the ongoing relationship with the customer and uncertainties related to the resolution of disputed matters. Quanta considers accounts receivable delinquent
after 30 days but does not generally include delinquent accounts in its analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts unless the accounts receivable have been outstanding for at least 90 days. In addition to balances that have been
outstanding for 90 days or more, Quanta also includes accounts receivable balances that relate to customers in bankruptcy or with other known difficulties in its analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Material changes in Quanta’s
customers’ business or cash flows, which may be impacted by negative economic and market conditions, could affect



Index to Financial Statements

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

Continued

)

Quanta’s ability to collect amounts due from them. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Quanta had allowances for doubtful accounts on current receivables of approximately
$2.8 million and $5.2 million. Long-term accounts receivable are included within other assets.

Should customers experience
financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy, or should anticipated recoveries relating to receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations fail to materialize, Quanta could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of
current allowances provided.

The balances billed but not paid by customers pursuant to retainage provisions in certain contracts are
generally due upon completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer. Based on Quanta’s experience with similar contracts in recent years, the majority of the retainage balances at each balance sheet date are expected to be collected
within the next twelve months. Current retainage balances as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $231.0 million and $250.1 million and were included in accounts receivable. Retainage balances with settlement dates beyond
the next twelve months were included in other assets, net, and as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $5.2 million and $4.5 million.

Within accounts receivable, Quanta recognizes unbilled receivables in circumstances such as when revenues have been earned and recorded but
the amount cannot be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date; costs have been incurred but are yet to be billed under cost-reimbursement type contracts; or amounts arise from routine lags in billing (for example, work completed one
month but not billed until the next month). These balances do not include revenues accrued for work performed under fixed-price contracts as these amounts are recorded as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts.
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the balances of unbilled receivables included in accounts receivable were approximately $206.8 million and $233.6 million.

Inventories

Inventories consist primarily of parts and supplies held for use in the ordinary course of business, which are valued by Quanta at the lower of
cost or market as determined by using either the

first-in,

first-out

(FIFO) method or the average costing method. Inventories also include certain job specific materials
not yet installed which are valued using the specific identification method.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is computed using the straight-line method, net of estimated salvage values, over
the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. Depreciation expense related to property and equipment was
approximately $170.2 million, $162.8 million and $141.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Accrued capital expenditures were $12.7 million and $5.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The impact of these items
has been excluded from Quanta’s capital expenditures on its consolidated statements of cash flows due to their

non-cash

nature.

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend
the useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated over the adjusted remaining useful lives of the assets. Upon retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from
the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be realizable. Quanta also recorded asset impairments primarily related to certain international renewable energy services operations of $8.0 million in 2016 and $6.6 million in 2015.
The 2016 impairment was primarily due to a pending disposition of certain international renewable energy services operations, and the 2015 impairment was based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows for the asset group as compared to their
carrying value.

When an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset group are compared
to the asset group’s carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset group is necessary. The effect of any impairment involves expensing the difference between the fair value of such asset group and its carrying value in the period
incurred.

Other Assets, Net

Other assets, net consists primarily of long-term receivables, debt issuance costs, equity and other investments, refundable security deposits
for leased properties and insurance claims in excess of deductibles that are due from Quanta’s insurers.

Debt Issuance Costs

Capitalized debt issuance costs related to Quanta’s credit facility and any other debt outstanding at a given balance sheet
date are included in other assets, net and are amortized into interest expense on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective agreements giving rise to the debt issuance costs, which Quanta believes approximates the effective interest
rate method. During 2015, Quanta incurred $3.8 million of debt issuance costs related to the amendment and restatement of its credit agreement and recorded a nominal charge to interest expense for the

write-off

of a portion of the debt issuance costs related to the prior facility. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, capitalized debt issuance costs were $11.4 million, with accumulated amortization of
$6.0 million and $4.8 million. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, amortization expense related to capitalized debt issuance costs was $1.4 million, $1.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Quanta has recorded goodwill in connection with its historical acquisitions of companies. Upon acquisition, these companies were either
combined into one of Quanta’s existing operating units or managed on a stand-alone basis as an individual operating unit. Goodwill recorded in connection with these acquisitions is subject to an annual assessment for impairment, which Quanta
performs at the operating unit level for each operating unit that carries a balance of goodwill. Each of Quanta’s operating units is organized into one of two internal divisions: the Electric Power Infrastructure Services Division and the Oil
and Gas Infrastructure Services Division. As most of the companies acquired by Quanta provide multiple types of services for multiple types of customers, these divisional designations are based on the predominant type of work performed by each
operating unit at the point in time the divisional designation is made. Goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at the reporting unit level, which represents the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level for
which discrete financial information is available. Quanta has determined that its individual operating units represent its reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill impairments.

Quanta has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the

two-step

fair value-based impairment test described below. If Quanta believes that, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
its carrying amount, the

)

quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. Quanta can choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units. Quanta
can also bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. Qualitative indicators including
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, declining financial performance, or a sustained decrease in share price, among other things, may trigger the need for annual or interim impairment testing of goodwill associated with one or all of the
reporting units.

Quanta’s goodwill impairment assessment is performed at

year-end,

or more
frequently if events or circumstances arise which indicate that goodwill may be impaired. For instance, a decrease in Quanta’s market capitalization below book value, a significant change in business climate or loss of a significant customer,
as well as the qualitative indicators referenced above, may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of goodwill for one or all of its reporting units. The first step of the

two-step

fair value-based
test involves comparing the fair value of each of Quanta’s reporting units with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step compares
the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied fair value of its goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction to goodwill with a
corresponding charge to operating expense.

Quanta determines the fair value of its reporting units using a weighted combination of the
discounted cash flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches, with heavier weighting on the discounted cash flow method, as in management’s opinion, this method currently results in the most accurate calculation of a
reporting unit’s fair value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates, operating margins,
discount rates, weighted average costs of capital and future market conditions. Quanta believes the estimates and assumptions used in its impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information, but variations in any of the
assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated.

Under the discounted cash flow method, Quanta determines fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit,
discounted to present value using risk-adjusted industry discount rates, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. Cash flow projections are derived from
budgeted amounts and operating forecasts (typically a

one-year

model) plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are developed for each
reporting unit using growth rates that management believes are reasonably likely to occur, along with a terminal value derived from the reporting unit’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The EBITDA
multiples for each reporting unit are based on trailing twelve-month comparable industry data.

Under the market multiple and market
capitalization approaches, Quanta determines the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units by applying transaction multiples to each reporting unit’s projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate with similar historical
calculations using either a one, two or three year average. For the market capitalization approach, Quanta adds a reasonable control premium, which is estimated as the premium that would be received in a sale of the reporting unit in an orderly
transaction between market participants.

The projected cash flows and estimated levels of EBITDA by reporting unit were used to
determine fair value under the three approaches discussed herein. The following table presents the significant estimates used by management in determining the fair values of Quanta’s reporting units at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

For recently acquired reporting units, a step one impairment test may indicate an implied fair value that is
substantially similar to the reporting unit’s carrying value. Such similarities in value are generally an indication that management’s estimates of future cash flows associated with the recently acquired reporting unit remain relatively
consistent with the assumptions that were used to derive its initial fair value.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, a

two-step

fair-value based goodwill impairment analysis was performed for each of Quanta’s reporting units, and no reporting units were evaluated solely on a qualitative basis. Step one of the analysis indicated
that the implied fair value of each of Quanta’s reporting units, other than recently acquired reporting units and the reporting units that recorded goodwill impairment charges in 2015, was substantially in excess of its carrying value.

As discussed generally above, when evaluating the 2016 step one impairment test results, management considered many factors in determining
whether or not an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit was reasonably likely to occur in future periods, including future market conditions and the economic environment in which Quanta’s reporting units were operating. Additionally,
management considered the sensitivity of its fair value estimates to changes in certain valuation assumptions. After taking into account a 10% decrease in the fair value of each of Quanta’s reporting units, two reporting units within
Quanta’s Oil and Gas Infrastructure Division had fair values below their respective carrying values. Quanta recorded asset impairment charges for these reporting units in 2015. The fair values determined in 2016 for these reporting units were
consistent with the fair values determined in 2015, accordingly the fair values approximate the current carrying values. Circumstances such as market declines, unfavorable economic conditions, the loss of a major customer or other factors could
increase the risk of impairment of goodwill in future periods.

If an operating unit experiences prolonged periods of declining revenues,
operating margins or both, it may be at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. Certain operating units have experienced declines over the short-term due to challenging macroeconomic conditions in certain geographic areas and low
oil and natural gas prices, which have negatively impacted customer spending and resulted in project cancellations and delays. Additionally, customer capital spending has been constrained as a result of an increasingly complex regulatory and
permitting environment. Certain operating units within Quanta’s Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division that primarily operate within the midstream and smaller-scale transmission market have continued to be negatively impacted by these
factors. Goodwill and intangible assets associated with the operating units within Quanta’s Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division that have been significantly impacted by the factors mentioned above were approximately $68.0 million
and $11.9 million at December 31, 2016. Quanta monitors these conditions and others to determine if it is necessary to perform step one of the fair-value based impairment test for one or more operating units prior to the annual impairment
assessment. No interim impairment charges were recorded during 2016. Although Quanta is not aware of circumstances that



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

)

would lead to a goodwill impairment at a reporting unit currently, circumstances such as a continued market decline, the loss of a major customer or other factors could impact the valuation of
goodwill in the future.

The goodwill analysis performed for each reporting unit was based on estimates and comparisons obtained from the
electric power and oil and gas industries. Quanta assigned a higher weighting to the discounted cash flow approach in all periods to reflect increased expectations of market value being determined from a “held and used” model. As stated
previously, cash flows are derived from budgeted amounts and operating forecasts that have been evaluated by management. In connection with the 2016 assessment, reporting unit growth rates during the cash flow projection period varied from negative
2% to positive 24%.

Quanta’s intangible assets include customer relationships, backlog, trade names,

non-compete

agreements, patented rights and developed technology, all subject to amortization. The value of customer relationships is estimated as of the date a business is acquired based on the

value-in-use

concept utilizing the income approach, specifically the excess earnings method. The excess earnings analysis consists of discounting to present value the
projected cash flows attributable to the customer relationships, with consideration given to customer contract renewals and estimated customer attrition rates, the importance or lack thereof of existing customer relationships to Quanta’s
business plan, income taxes and required rates of return. Quanta values backlog for acquired businesses as of the acquisition date based upon the contractual nature of the backlog within each service line, using the income approach to discount back
to present value the cash flows attributable to the backlog. The value of trade names is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. This approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company would be
willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this intangible asset.

Quanta amortizes intangible assets based upon
the estimated consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset, or on a straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed
for impairment and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For instance, a significant change in business climate or a loss of a significant customer, among
other things, may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of intangible assets. An impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, management concluded that goodwill was impaired at two reporting units in Quanta’s Oil and Gas
Infrastructure Services Division. Accordingly, Quanta recorded a $39.8 million

non-cash

charge for the impairment of goodwill and an impairment charge of $12.1 million related to customer
relationships, trade names and

non-compete

agreement intangible assets. These asset impairments primarily resulted from lower levels of expected activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and, to a lesser extent, due
to the extended low commodity price environment with respect to certain directional drilling operations in Australia.

Investments
in Affiliates and Other Entities

In the normal course of business, Quanta enters into various types of investment arrangements,
each having unique terms and conditions. These investments may include equity interests held by Quanta in business entities, including general or limited partnerships, contractual joint ventures, or other forms of equity or profit participation.
These investments may also include Quanta’s participation in different financing structures such as the extension of loans to project specific entities, the acquisition of convertible notes issued by project specific entities, or other
strategic financing arrangements. Quanta determines whether such investments involve a variable interest entity (VIE) based on the characteristics of the subject entity. If the entity is determined to be a VIE, then management determines if Quanta
is the primary beneficiary of the entity and whether or not



Index to Financial Statements

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

Continued

)

consolidation of the VIE is required. The primary beneficiary consolidating the VIE must normally have both (i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly affect the
VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE, in either case that could potentially be significant to the VIE. When Quanta is deemed to be the primary
beneficiary, the VIE is consolidated and the other party’s equity interest in the VIE is accounted for as a

non-controlling

interest. In cases where Quanta determines that it has an undivided interest in
the assets, liabilities, revenues and profits of an unincorporated VIE (e.g., a general partnership interest), such amounts are consolidated on a basis proportional to Quanta’s ownership interest in the unincorporated entity.

Investments in entities of which Quanta is not the primary beneficiary, but over which Quanta has the ability to exercise significant
influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Quanta’s share of net income or losses from unconsolidated equity investments is included in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated
statements of operations when applicable. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment by assessing whether any decline in the fair value of the investment below the carrying value is other than temporary. In making this determination, factors
such as the ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment and the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity are evaluated in determining whether a loss in value should be recognized. Any impairment losses related to
investments would be recognized in other expense. Equity method investments are carried at original cost and are included in other assets, net in the consolidated balance sheet and are adjusted for Quanta’s proportionate share of the
investees’ income, losses and distributions.

Revenue Recognition

Through its Electric Power Infrastructure Services and Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segments, Quanta designs, installs and maintains
networks for customers in the electric power and oil and gas industries. These services may be provided pursuant to master service agreements, repair and maintenance contracts and fixed price and

non-fixed

price installation contracts. Pricing under these contracts may be competitive unit price, cost-plus/hourly (or time and materials basis) or fixed price (or lump sum basis), and the final terms and prices of these contracts are frequently negotiated
with the customer. Under unit-based contracts, the utilization of an output-based measurement is appropriate for revenue recognition. Under these contracts, Quanta recognizes revenue as units are completed based on pricing established between Quanta
and the customer for each unit of delivery, which best reflects the pattern in which the obligation to the customer is fulfilled. Under cost-plus/hourly and time and materials type contracts, Quanta recognizes revenue on an input basis, as labor
hours are incurred and services are performed.

Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract. These contracts provide for a fixed amount of
revenues for the entire project. Such contracts provide that the customer accept completion of progress to date and compensate Quanta for services rendered, which may be measured in terms of units installed, hours expended, costs incurred to date
compared to total estimated contract costs or some other measure of progress. Contract costs include all direct materials, labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools,
repairs and depreciation costs. Much of the material associated with Quanta’s work is owner-furnished and is therefore not included in contract revenues and costs. The cost estimation process is based on professional knowledge and experience of
Quanta’s engineers, project managers and financial professionals. Changes in job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence management’s assessment of total contract value and the total estimated
costs to complete those contracts and therefore, Quanta’s profit recognition.



Index to Financial Statements

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

)

Actual revenues and project costs can vary, sometimes substantially, from previous estimates
due to changes in a variety of factors including unforeseen circumstances not included in Quanta’s cost estimates or covered by its contracts for which it cannot obtain adequate compensation, including concealed or unknown environmental
conditions; changes in the cost of equipment, commodities, materials or labor; unanticipated costs or claims due to customer-caused delays, customer failure to provide required materials or equipment, errors in engineering, specifications or
designs, project modifications, or contract termination and Quanta’s inability to obtain reimbursement for such costs or recover on such claims; weather conditions; and quality issues requiring rework or replacement. These factors, along with
other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts may cause actual revenues and gross profits for a project to differ from previous estimates and could result in reduced profitability or losses on projects. Changes in these factors may result
in revisions to costs and income, and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. These factors are routinely evaluated on a project by project basis throughout the project term, and the impact of corresponding
revisions in management’s estimates of contract value, contract cost and contract profit are recorded as necessary in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in
which such losses are determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

During 2016 and 2015, Quanta experienced
performance issues on a power plant project in Alaska that resulted in an increase of the estimated total costs necessary to complete the project. During the construction and commissioning phases, the project experienced third party engineering
deficiencies that changed Quanta’s planned scope of work and performance failures by other contractors operating onsite. These issues resulted in higher than expected production costs associated with quality deficiencies and a related impact on
production sequencing. Additionally, late in the second quarter of 2016, Quanta experienced a claimed force majeure event that further disrupted project timing and provided the customer and its insurance providers with a notice of the event in order
to seek schedule relief and cost recovery. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Quanta recognized project losses of $54.8 million and $44.9 million. Quanta is in the process of developing potential claims for damages
that may have resulted from the third party engineering and other contractor performance issues; however, no revenues or cost recovery has been reflected in Quanta’s estimate of total project losses at December 31, 2016. This project had a
contract value of $202 million at December 31, 2016 and was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. As this project continues through the close out phase, it is possible that additional performance issues or other
unforeseen circumstances could occur and result in the recognition of additional losses on this project; however, such amounts cannot currently be estimated.

Overall, Quanta’s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016 were impacted by less than 5% as a result of aggregate
changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress at December 31, 2015. Included in the operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016 were losses from the project described above, offset by the aggregate
positive impact of numerous individually immaterial changes in project profitability generally due to better than expected performance for projects that were ongoing at December 31, 2015. Quanta’s operating results for the year ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014 were impacted by numerous individually immaterial changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress at December 31, 2014 and 2013; however, the aggregate impact was less than 5%.

The current asset “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents revenues recognized in
excess of amounts billed for fixed price contracts. The current liability “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized for fixed price contracts.

Quanta may incur costs subject to change orders, whether approved or unapproved by the customer, and/or claims related to certain contracts.
Quanta determines the probability that such costs will be recovered based



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

)

upon evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer or verbal approvals. Quanta treats items as costs of contract
performance in the period incurred if it is not probable that the costs will be recovered or will recognize revenue if it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be reliably estimated.

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Quanta had recognized revenues of approximately $137.8 million and $137.2 million related to
change orders and/or claims that had been included as contract price adjustments on certain contracts which were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business.

These aggregate contract price adjustments represent management’s best estimate of additional contract revenues which have been earned
and which management believes are probable of collection. The amounts ultimately realized by Quanta upon final acceptance by its customers could be higher or lower than such estimated amounts; however, such amounts cannot currently be estimated.

Income Taxes

Quanta follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets, and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the underlying assets or
liabilities are recovered or settled.

Quanta regularly evaluates valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which
future realization is uncertain. The estimation of required valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Quanta considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. If actual future taxable income differs from these estimates, Quanta may not
realize deferred tax assets to the extent estimated.

Quanta records reserves for income taxes related to certain tax positions in those
instances where Quanta considers it more likely than not that additional taxes may be due in excess of amounts reflected on income tax returns filed. When recording reserves for expected tax consequences of uncertain positions, Quanta assumes that
taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Quanta continually reviews exposure to additional tax obligations, and as further information is known or events occur, changes in tax reserves may be recorded. To the
extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have been accrued and included in the provision for income taxes.

As of December 31, 2016, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions was $35.2 million, a
decrease from December 31, 2015 of $19.3 million. This decrease in unrecognized tax benefits resulted primarily from a $23.4 million decrease due to expiration of certain federal and state statute of limitations, partially offset by a
$4.2 million increase due to tax positions to be taken for 2016. Although the IRS completed its examination related to tax years 2010, 2011 and 2012 during 2016, certain subsidiaries remain under examination by various U.S. state, Canadian and
other foreign tax authorities for multiple periods. Quanta believes it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $12.3 million as a result of settlement of these examinations or as a
result of the expiration of certain statute of limitations periods.

U.S. federal and state and foreign income tax laws and regulations
are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, Quanta is required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding its tax positions that could materially affect amounts recognized in its future consolidated balance sheets and
statements of operations and comprehensive income.

)

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and diluted earnings per
share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period adjusted for all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, except in cases where the effect of the common stock equivalents would be
antidilutive.

Self-Insurance

Quanta is insured for employer’s liability, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability claims. Under these programs,
the deductible for employer’s liability is $1.0 million per occurrence, the deductible for workers’ compensation is $5.0 million per occurrence, and the deductibles for auto liability and general liability are $10.0 million
per occurrence. Quanta is generally self-insured for all claims that do not exceed the amount of the applicable deductible. Quanta also has employee health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements, of
which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $0.4 million per claimant per year.

Losses under all of these insurance
programs are accrued based upon Quanta’s estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to assess
and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of Quanta’s liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known
facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate.

Collective Bargaining Agreements

Some of Quanta’s operating units are parties to various collective bargaining agreements with unions that represent certain of their
employees. The collective bargaining agreements expire at various times and have typically been renegotiated and renewed on terms similar to those in the expiring agreements. The agreements require the operating units to pay specified wages, provide
certain benefits to their union employees and contribute certain amounts to multiemployer pension plans and employee benefit trusts. Quanta’s multiemployer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in the collective bargaining
agreements (usually on an annual basis), and contributions are made to the plans on a

“pay-as-you-go”

basis based on
its union employee payrolls. The location and number of union employees that Quanta employs at any given time and the plans in which they may participate vary depending on the projects Quanta has ongoing at that time and the need for union resources
in connection with those projects. Therefore, Quanta is unable to accurately predict the union employee payroll and the amount of the resulting multiemployer pension plan contribution obligation for future periods.

Stock-Based Compensation

Quanta recognizes compensation expense for restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance units to be settled in common stock
based on the fair value of the awards at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. The fair value of restricted stock awards, RSUs and performance units to be settled in common stock is determined based on the number of shares, RSUs or
performance units granted and the closing price of Quanta’s common stock on the date of grant. An estimate of future forfeitures is required in determining the period expense. Quanta uses historical data to estimate the forfeiture rate;
however, these estimates are subject to change and may impact the value that will ultimately be recognized as compensation expense. The resulting compensation expense from time-based RSU and performance unit awards is recognized on a straight-line
basis



Index to Financial Statements

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

)

over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, while compensation expense from performance-based RSU awards is recognized using the graded vesting method over the
requisite service period. The cash flows resulting from the tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for restricted stock, RSUs and performance units to be settled in common stock and stock options (excess tax benefit) are
classified as financing cash flows.

Compensation expense associated with liability based awards, such as RSUs that are expected to or may
settle in cash, is recognized based on a remeasurement of the fair value of the award at the end of each reporting period. Upon settlement, the holders receive for each RSU an amount in cash equal to the fair market value on the settlement date of
one share of Quanta common stock, as specified in the applicable award agreement. For additional information on Quanta’s restricted stock, RSUs, and performance unit awards, see Note 12.

Functional Currency and Translation of Financial Statements

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the majority of Quanta’s operations, which are primarily located within the United States.
The functional currency for Quanta’s foreign operations, which are primarily located in Canada and Australia, is typically the currency of the country in which the foreign operating unit is located. Generally, the currency in which the
operating unit transacts the majority of its activities, including billings, financing, payroll and other expenditures, would be considered the functional currency. The treatment of foreign currency translation gains or losses is dependent upon
management’s determination of the functional currency of each operating unit. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, Quanta translates the financial statements of its foreign operating units from their functional currency into U.S.
dollars. Statements of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows are translated at average monthly rates, while balance sheets are translated at

month-end

exchange rates. The translation of the balance
sheet results in translation gains or losses, which are included as a separate component of equity under the caption “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Gains and losses arising from transactions which are not denominated in
the operating units’ functional currencies are included within other income (expense) in the statements of operations.

Derivatives

From
time to time, Quanta enters into forward currency contracts that qualify as derivatives in order to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to certain forecasted foreign currency denominated
transactions. Quanta does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes; however, for accounting purposes, certain transactions may not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting. For a hedge to qualify for cash flow hedge
accounting treatment, a hedge must be documented at the inception of the contract, with the objective and strategy stated, along with an explicit description of the methodology used to assess hedge effectiveness. The dates (or periods) for the
expected forecasted events and the nature of the exposure involved (including quantitative measures of the size of the exposure) must also be documented. At the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the hedge must be deemed to be
“highly effective” at minimizing the risk of the identified exposure. Effectiveness measures relate the gains or losses of the derivative to changes in the cash flows associated with the hedged item, and the forecasted transaction must be
probable of occurring.

For forward contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges, Quanta accounts for the change in fair value of the
forward contracts directly in equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Any ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period in which ineffectiveness occurs. For instance, if a forward contract
is discontinued as a cash flow hedge because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period, the related amounts in accumulated



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

)

other comprehensive income (loss) would be reclassified to other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations in the period such determination is made. When a forecasted
transaction occurs, the portion of the accumulated gain or loss applicable to the forecasted transaction is reclassified from equity to earnings. Changes in fair value related to transactions that do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge
accounting are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and are included in other income (expense).

Comprehensive
Income

Components of comprehensive income include all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from changes in
Quanta’s capital related accounts. Quanta records other comprehensive income (loss) for foreign currency translation adjustments related to its foreign operations and for other revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are included in
comprehensive income but excluded from net income.

Litigation Costs and Reserves

Quanta records reserves when the likelihood of incurring a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Costs incurred
for litigation are expensed as incurred. Further details are presented in Note 15.

Fair Value Measurements

The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the
short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of variable rate debt also approximates fair value. For disclosure purposes, qualifying assets and liabilities are categorized into three broad levels based on the priority of the inputs
used to determine their fair values. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). All of
Quanta’s cash equivalents were categorized as Level 1 assets at December 31, 2016 and 2015, as all values were based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market that Quanta has the ability to access.

In connection with Quanta’s acquisitions, identifiable intangible assets acquired typically include goodwill, backlog, customer
relationships, trade names, covenants

not-to-compete,

patented rights and developed technology. Quanta utilizes the fair value premise as the primary basis for its
valuation procedures, which is a market-based approach to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Quanta periodically engages the services of
an independent valuation firm when a new business is acquired to assist management with this valuation process, including assistance with the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the development of market-based valuation assumptions.
Based on these considerations, management utilizes various valuation methods, including an income approach, a market approach and a cost approach, to determine the fair value of intangible assets acquired based on the appropriateness of each method
in relation to the type of asset being valued. The assumptions used in these valuation methods are analyzed and compared, where possible, to available market data, such as industry-based weighted average costs of capital and discount rates, trade
name royalty rates, public company valuation multiples and recent market acquisition multiples. In accordance with its annual impairment test during the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the carrying amounts of such assets, including goodwill,
were compared to their fair values. The level of inputs used for these fair value measurements is the lowest level (Level 3). Quanta uses the assistance of third party specialists to develop valuation assumptions. Quanta believes that these
valuation methods appropriately represent the methods that would be used by other market participants in determining fair value.

Quanta also uses fair value measurements in connection with the valuation of its investments
in private company equity interests and financing instruments. These valuations require significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such assets. Typically,
the initial costs of these investments are considered to represent fair market value, as such amounts are negotiated between willing market participants. On a quarterly basis, Quanta performs an evaluation of its investments to determine if an
other-than-temporary decline in the value of each investment has occurred and whether the recorded amount of each investment will be realizable. If an other-than-temporary decline in the value of an investment occurs, a fair value analysis would be
performed to determine the degree to which the investment was impaired and a corresponding charge to earnings would be recorded during the period. These types of fair market value assessments are similar to other nonrecurring fair value measures
used by Quanta, which include the use of significant judgment and available relevant market data. Such market data may include observations of the valuation of comparable companies, risk adjusted discount rates and an evaluation of the expected
performance of the underlying portfolio asset, including historical and projected levels of profitability or cash flows. In addition, a variety of additional factors may be reviewed by management, including, but not limited to, contemporaneous
financing and sales transactions with third parties, changes in market outlook and the third-party financing environment.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2015, the FASB issued an update which amends consolidation guidance, including amending the guidance related to
determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity (VIE). The guidance may be applied using a modified retrospective approach whereby the entity records a cumulative effect of adoption at the beginning of the fiscal year of initial
application. A reporting entity may also apply the amendments on a full retrospective basis. Quanta adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016, and the adoption of the update did not have a significant impact on Quanta’s consolidated
financial statements or related disclosures.

In April 2015, the FASB issued an update that requires debt issuance costs related to a
recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts and premiums. The update is required to be adopted retroactively
for all periods presented. In August 2015, the FASB issued another update that states that the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently
amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the

line-of-credit

arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the

line-of-credit

arrangement. Quanta adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016, and the adoption of the update did not have a significant impact on Quanta’s
consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.

In April 2015, the FASB issued an update that provides guidance to customers
about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the
acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. An entity can elect to adopt the amendments either prospectively to
all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or retrospectively. Quanta adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016, and the adoption of the update did not have a significant impact on Quanta’s
consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.

In September 2015, the FASB issued an update that requires an acquiring company
to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which such



Index to Financial Statements

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

Continued

)

adjustments are determined. An acquiring company must record any effect on earnings from changes in depreciation or amortization or other income effects, calculated as if the accounting had been
completed at the acquisition date. The acquiring company must also present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the amount recorded in current-period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting
periods if the adjustment had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The update is required to be adopted prospectively to adjustments that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not
yet been issued. Quanta adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016, and the adoption of the update did not have a significant impact on Quanta’s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.

In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance to address the diversity in practice in determining when there is substantial doubt about an
entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and when and how an entity must disclose certain relevant conditions and events. This update requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate,
that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). If such conditions or events exist, an entity
should disclose that there is substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued), along with the principal
conditions or events that raise substantial doubt, management’s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity’s ability to meet its obligations and management’s plans that are intended to
mitigate those conditions or events. This guidance will impact the disclosure and presentation of any substantial doubt by Quanta about its ability to continue as a going concern, if such substantial doubt were to exist. Quanta adopted this guidance
on December 31, 2016, and the adoption of the update did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements or related disclosures but would have an impact if such a substantial doubt were to exist in the future.

In January 2017, the FASB issued an update that amended SEC guidance within the Accounting Standards Codification that related to disclosing
the impact that recently issued accounting standards will have on a registrant’s financial statements when such standards are adopted in future periods. Quanta has followed the guidance in this amendment within this note to the consolidated
financial statements.

Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In May 2014, the FASB issued an update that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, as well as some cost recognition guidance.
The update requires that the recognition of revenue related to the transfer of goods or services to customers reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This update also requires
new qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, information about contract balances
and performance obligations, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In July 2015, the FASB affirmed its proposal to defer the effective date until fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2017. The
guidance can be applied on a full retrospective or modified retrospective basis whereby the entity records a cumulative effect of initially applying this update at the date of initial application.

Quanta is currently evaluating the potential impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements, as well as the impact of its
selected transition method as Quanta continues through the implementation process. In addition, Quanta continues to monitor activity related to the new standard as well as working with various non-authoritative groups regarding industry
clarifications and interpretations, which may impact Quanta’s considerations and conclusions. Significant areas of ongoing consideration include the impact of termination for



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

)

convenience provisions on the duration of contracts and accounting for mobilization-related costs and uninstalled materials. While Quanta is still evaluating the requirements of this update, it
currently does not expect the update to materially affect its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. This preliminary conclusion is based on Quanta’s belief that it will generally continue to recognize revenues from long-term
service contracts over time as services are performed and the underlying obligation to the customer is fulfilled. Quanta has identified and is in the process of implementing changes to its processes and internal controls to meet the reporting and
disclosure requirements of this update and will adopt this update effective January 1, 2018.

In July 2015, the FASB issued an update
that requires inventory to be measured at the lower of either cost or net realizable value. When evidence exists that the net realizable value of inventory is lower than its cost, the difference will be recognized as a loss in earnings in the period
in which it occurs. The update is required to be adopted prospectively and is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted. The adoption of the update is not
anticipated to have a significant impact on Quanta’s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.

In January 2016, the
FASB issued an update that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. The new standard is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements of fiscal years or interim periods that have not been previously issued. Quanta is evaluating the impact of the new standard on
its consolidated financial statements and will adopt the new standard by January 1, 2018.

In February 2016, the FASB issued an
update that requires companies to recognize on the balance sheet the contractual right to use assets and liabilities corresponding to the rights and obligations created by lease contracts. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements of fiscal years or interim periods that have not been previously issued. While Quanta continues to evaluate the effect of the standard on its consolidated
financial statements, it is anticipated that the adoption of the standard will materially impact its statement of financial position.

In
March 2016, the FASB issued an update that will amend the accounting for share-based payments in several key areas, including the treatment and cash flow presentation of tax effects related to the settlement of share-based payments and the
accounting for forfeitures of share-based awards. The new guidance will require companies with share-based payments to record all tax effects related thereto at settlement (or expiration) through income tax expense on the statement of operations
rather than through additional

paid-in

capital within equity. This update will also require excess tax benefits to be classified as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than reclassified
as a financing activity and will require cash paid by an employer when withholding shares for taxes to be presented as a financing activity. The update also allows companies to either account for forfeitures of share-based payments as they occur or
to estimate forfeitures. This guidance is required to be applied prospectively except for the requirement to classify cash paid when withholding shares for the employee portion of taxes as a financing activity, which requires retrospective
application. The update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Quanta will continue to estimate forfeitures of share-based payments. It is anticipated that Quanta will experience increased
volatility of income tax expense upon adoption of this update.

In June 2016, the FASB issued an update that will change the way companies
measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The update will require companies to use an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized
cost and to record allowances for

available-for-sale

(AFS) debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amounts. The update will

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

)

also require disclosure of information regarding how a company developed its allowance, including changes in the factors that influenced management’s estimate of expected credit losses and
the reasons for those changes. Companies will apply this standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The new standard is
effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, although early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Quanta is currently evaluating the potential impact
of this authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements and will adopt this guidance by January 1, 2020.

In August
2016, the FASB issued an update intended to standardize the classification of certain transactions on the statement of cash flows. These transactions include contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the
settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies and distributions received from equity method investments. The new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although early adoption
is permitted, and requires application using a retrospective transition method. Quanta is currently evaluating the potential impact of this authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements and will adopt this guidance by
January 1, 2018.

In October 2016, the FASB issued an update that will require a reporting entity to recognize the tax expense from
the sale of an asset in the seller’s tax jurisdiction when the transfer occurs, even though the

pre-tax

effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation. Any deferred tax asset that arises in
the buyer’s jurisdiction would also be recognized at the time of the transfer. The new guidance will not apply to intra-entity transfers of inventory. The income tax consequences from the sale of inventory from one member of a consolidated
entity to another will continue to be deferred until the inventory is sold to a third party. The new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although early adoption is permitted. The
modified retrospective method will be required for transition to the new guidance, with a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded in retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Quanta is currently evaluating the potential impact
of this authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements and will adopt this guidance by January 1, 2018.

In October
2016, the FASB issued an update that will amend the consolidation guidance related to how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a VIE should treat indirect interests in the VIE held through related parties that are under common
control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. A reporting entity has an indirect interest in a VIE if it has a direct interest in a related party that, in turn, has a direct interest in the VIE.
The new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted. Since Quanta has already adopted a related update, it will be required to apply the amendments in
this update retrospectively to all relevant prior periods beginning with the fiscal year in which the amendments in the prior update were initially applied. Quanta will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2017, and the adoption of the update is
not anticipated to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.

In November 2016, the FASB
issued an update intended to standardize the classification of restricted cash and cash equivalents transactions on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017, although early adoption is permitted. The retrospective transition method will be required for this new guidance. Quanta is currently evaluating the potential impact of this authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements and
will adopt this guidance by January 1, 2018.

In January 2017, the FASB issued an update intended to clarify the definition of a
business to assist entities with evaluation of whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or



Index to Financial Statements

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

Continued

)

businesses. The new definition requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of
similar identifiable assets, the asset or group is not a business. The update will require that to be considered a business, a set of assets and activities must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly
contribute to the ability to create output. Additionally, the update will remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements in order to consider the set of assets and activities a business, will provide more
stringent criteria for sets without outputs and will narrow the definition of output. The new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although early adoption is permitted for certain
transactions. The prospective transition method will be required for this new guidance. Quanta is currently evaluating the potential impact of this authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements and will adopt this guidance by
January 1, 2018.

Also in January 2017, the FASB issued an update intended to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by
eliminating the second step in the current

two-step

goodwill impairment test. The update will require an entity to perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a
reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity will recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, if applicable. Additionally, the update will eliminate the requirement
that a reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount perform a qualitative assessment and the second step of the

two-step

goodwill impairment test and will instead require disclosure of the amount of
goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets. This update is effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, although early adoption is
permitted for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The prospective transition method will be required for this new guidance. Quanta is currently evaluating the potential impact of this
authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements and will adopt this guidance by January 1, 2020.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS:

On August 4, 2015, Quanta completed the sale of its fiber
optic licensing operations to Crown Castle for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1 billion in cash, resulting in estimated

after-tax

net proceeds of approximately $848 million. In the
third quarter of 2015, Quanta recognized a

pre-tax

gain of approximately $272 million and a corresponding tax expense of approximately $101 million, which resulted in a gain on the sale, net of tax,
of approximately $171 million. Quanta remains liable for all taxes and insured claims associated with the fiber optic licensing operations arising on or before or outstanding as of August 4, 2015.

ACQUISITIONS:

2016 Acquisitions

During 2016, Quanta completed five acquisitions. The results of four of the acquired companies are generally included in Quanta’s Electric
Power Infrastructure Services segment. These companies included an electrical infrastructure services company located in Australia, a utility contracting company located in Canada, a full service medium- and high-voltage powerline contracting
company located in the United States and a telecommunications company located in Canada. Quanta also acquired a pipeline service contractor located in the United States, the results of which are generally included in Quanta’s Oil and Gas
Infrastructure Services segment. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $75.9 million paid or payable in cash, subject to certain adjustments, 70,840 shares of Quanta common stock valued at approximately
$1.5 million as of the settlement date of the applicable acquisition, and contingent consideration payments of up to $39.5 million, which will be paid if certain financial targets are achieved. Based on the estimated fair value of this
contingent consideration, Quanta recorded an $18.7 million liability. As these transactions were effective during 2016, the results have been included in Quanta’s consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective dates of
acquisition. These acquisitions should enable Quanta to further enhance its service offerings in the United States, Australia and Canada.

Quanta is in the process of finalizing its assessments of the fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities related to businesses
acquired during 2016, and further adjustments to the purchase price allocations may occur. Quanta expects to complete the purchase accounting process as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the respective acquisition dates with
possible updates primarily related to certain tax estimates. The aggregate purchase consideration of these businesses was preliminarily allocated to acquired assets and assumed liabilities, which resulted in a preliminary allocation of approximately
$39.4 million of net tangible assets, $45.2 million of goodwill and $11.5 million of other intangible assets.

Acquisitions

During 2015, Quanta acquired 11 companies. The results of eight of the acquired companies are generally included in
Quanta’s Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. These companies include a foundation services company located in the United States, an electrical contracting company located in the United States, an electrical engineering company
located in Australia, a powerline construction company located in the United States, an engineering company located in Canada, an engineering, procurement and construction services company based in the United States, an underground construction
contracting company located in Canada, and a supplier and material procurement specialist for the power and utility industry in Canada. The results of the remaining three acquired companies are generally included in Quanta’s Oil and Gas
Infrastructure Services segment. These companies include a company that services above-ground storage tanks in the United States, an underground utility distribution contractor that provides services to gas and electric utilities in Canada, and a
company that specializes in the engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning of compression and surface facilities for the high pressure gas industry in Australia. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions consisted of
approximately $110.6 million paid or payable in cash, subject to net working capital adjustments, 461,037 shares of Quanta common stock valued at approximately $10.1 million as of the settlement dates of the applicable acquisitions, and
$1.0 million in contingent consideration. As these transactions were effective during 2015, the results have been included in Quanta’s consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective dates of acquisition. These acquisitions
should enable Quanta to further enhance its electric power and oil and gas infrastructure service offerings in the United States, Canada and Australia.

2014 Acquisitions

During 2014, Quanta completed nine acquisitions, which enabled Quanta to further enhance its electric power and oil and gas infrastructure
service offerings in the United States and Canada and expand its capabilities in Australia to include electric power infrastructure service offerings. These acquisitions included four electric power infrastructure services companies located in
Canada; two oil and gas infrastructure services businesses located in Canada; an electric power infrastructure services company located in Australia; a U.S. based general engineering and construction company specializing in hydrant fueling,
waterfront and utility construction for the U.S. Department of Defense that is generally included in Quanta’s Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment; and a geotechnical and geological engineering services company based in the United States
that is generally included in Quanta’s Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. The aggregate consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $279.5 million in cash, 686,382 shares of Quanta common stock and
3,825,971 exchangeable shares of Canadian subsidiaries of Quanta that are exchangeable on a

one-for-one

basis for Quanta common stock. In addition, Quanta issued one
share of Series G preferred stock associated with 899,858 of the exchangeable shares. The aggregate value of the securities issued related to 2014 acquisitions on the respective closing or settlement dates of the acquisitions, totaled approximately
$134.5 million. As these transactions were effective during 2014, the results of each acquired company have been included in Quanta’s consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective dates of acquisition. For additional
information on the exchangeable shares and preferred stock, see

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the net amount of the fair values
assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The 2016, 2015 and 2014 acquisitions strategically expanded Quanta’s Canadian, Australian and domestic electric power and oil and gas service offerings, which Quanta believes contributes to
the recognition of the goodwill. In connection with the 2016 acquisitions, goodwill of $24.2 million was recorded for the businesses acquired that were included within Quanta’s Electric Power Infrastructure Services Division and
$21.0 million was recorded for the business acquired that was included within Quanta’s Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division on the dates of acquisition, inclusive of purchase price allocation adjustments. In connection with the
2015 acquisitions, goodwill of $31.5 million was recorded for the acquired businesses that were included within Quanta’s Electric Power Infrastructure Services Division and $20.4 million was recorded for acquired businesses that were
included within Quanta’s Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division on the dates of acquisition, inclusive of purchase price allocation adjustments. In connection with the 2014 acquisitions, goodwill of $72.3 million was recorded for
acquired businesses that were included within Quanta’s Electric Power Infrastructure Services Division and $94.1 million was recorded for the acquired business that was included within Quanta’s Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services
Division on the dates of acquisition, inclusive of purchase price allocation adjustments. Goodwill of approximately $2.0 million related to the 2016 acquisitions is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes, and goodwill of

they occurred January 1, 2015. The pro forma combined results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 have also been prepared by adjusting the historical results of Quanta to
include the historical results of the 2015 acquisitions as if they occurred January 1, 2014. The pro forma combined results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 have been prepared by adjusting the historical results of Quanta
to include the historical results of the 2015 acquisitions as if they occurred January 1, 2014 and the historical results of the 2014 acquisitions as if it occurred January 1, 2013. These pro forma combined historical results were also
adjusted for the following: a reduction of interest expense as a result of the repayment of outstanding indebtedness of the acquired businesses, a reduction of interest income as a result of the cash consideration paid net of cash received, an
increase in amortization expense due to the incremental intangible assets recorded related to the 2016, 2015 and 2014 acquisitions, an increase or decrease in depreciation expense within cost of services related to the net impact of adjusting
acquired property and equipment to the acquisition date fair value and conforming depreciable lives with Quanta’s accounting policies, an increase in the number of outstanding shares of Quanta common stock and exchangeable shares and certain
reclassifications to conform the acquired companies’ presentation to Quanta’s accounting policies. The pro forma results of operations do not include any adjustments to eliminate the impact of acquisition related costs or any cost savings
or other synergies that resulted or may result from the 2016, 2015 and 2014 acquisitions. As noted above, the pro forma results of operations do not purport to be indicative of the actual results that would have been achieved by the combined company
for the periods presented or that may be achieved by the combined company in the future.

Revenues of approximately $68.5 million and
a loss before taxes of approximately $5.6 million, which included $0.3 million of acquisition costs, were included in Quanta’s consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the five
acquisitions in 2016 following their respective dates of acquisition. Revenues of approximately $104.6 million and income before income taxes of approximately $0.3 million, which included $3.6 million of acquisition costs, were included in
Quanta’s consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the 11 acquisitions in 2015 following their respective dates of acquisition. Additionally, revenues of approximately $314.1 million and income
before income taxes of approximately $3.4 million, which included $11.6 million of acquisition costs, were included in Quanta’s consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to the nine
acquisitions in 2014 following their respective dates of acquisition.

The purchase price allocation adjustments recorded in the year ended December 31, 2016
primarily represent changes in deferred tax liability estimates and would have had no impact on the consolidated financial statements in prior periods had these adjustments been booked at the respective acquisition dates. The purchase price
allocation adjustments recorded in the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from net working capital adjustments and changes in tax estimates. The goodwill impairment in the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily resulted from
lower levels of expected activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and, to a lesser extent, due to the extended low commodity price environment with respect to certain directional drilling operations in Australia. The two reporting units impacted are in
Quanta’s Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division.

Also, as described in Note 2, Quanta’s operating units are
organized into one of Quanta’s two internal divisions and, accordingly, the goodwill associated with the operating units has been aggregated on a divisional basis in the table above. These divisions are closely aligned with Quanta’s
reportable segments and operating units are assigned to a division based on the predominant type of work performed. From time to time, operating units may be reorganized between divisions as business environments evolve.

Quanta’s intangible assets subject to amortization and the remaining weighted average amortization periods related to such assets were as

Amortization expense for intangible assets was $31.7 million, $34.8 million and $34.3 million
for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, Quanta recorded an impairment charge of $12.1 million related to customer relationships, trade names and

non-compete

agreement intangible assets. These intangible asset impairments primarily resulted from lower levels of expected activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and, to a lesser extent, due to the extended low
commodity price environment with respect to certain directional drilling operations in Australia. The two reporting units impacted are in Quanta’s Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division. The impairment charge is reflected in the

PER SHARE INFORMATION:

Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period, and diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period adjusted for all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, except
in cases where the effect of the common stock equivalents would be antidilutive. The amounts used to compute the basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are illustrated below (in thousands):

For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, there were no adjustments required to derive
Quanta’s net income attributable to common stock. Outstanding exchangeable shares that were issued pursuant to certain of Quanta’s historical acquisitions (as further discussed in Note 11), which are exchangeable on a

one-for-one

basis with shares of Quanta common stock, have been included in weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 for the portion of the respective periods that they were outstanding. Weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2016 were reduced by the
additional shares received on April 12, 2016 in settlement of an accelerated share repurchase arrangement (as further described in Note 11).

Credit Facility

On December 18, 2015, Quanta entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with various lenders that provides for a
$1.81 billion senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on December 18, 2020. The entire amount available under the facility may be used by Quanta for revolving loans and letters of credit in U.S. dollars and certain alternative
currencies. Up to $600.0 million of the facility may be used by certain subsidiaries of Quanta for revolving loans and letters of credit in certain alternative currencies. Up to $100.0 million of the facility may be used for swing line
loans in U.S. dollars, up to $50.0 million of the facility may be used for swing line loans in Canadian dollars and up to $30.0 million of the facility may be used for swing line loans in Australian dollars. In addition, subject to the
conditions specified in the credit agreement, Quanta has the option to increase the revolving commitments by up to $400.0 million from time to time upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Borrowings under the credit
agreement are to be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2016, Quanta had approximately $305.6 million of outstanding
letters of credit and bank guarantees, $210.8 million of which were denominated in U.S. dollars and $94.8 million of which were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in Australian or Canadian dollars. Quanta also
had $351.3 million of outstanding revolving loans under the credit facility, $210.0 million of which were denominated in U.S. dollars and $141.3 million of which were denominated in Canadian dollars. The remaining $1.15 billion
was available for revolving loans or new letters of credit or bank guarantees. Information on borrowings under Quanta’s credit facility and the applicable interest rates during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows

Under the current credit agreement, amounts borrowed in U.S. dollars bear interest, at Quanta’s option,
at a rate equal to either (i) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 1.125% to 2.125%, as determined based on Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as described below), or (ii) the Base Rate (as described
below) plus 0.125% to 1.125%, as determined based on Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Amounts borrowed as revolving loans under the credit agreement in any currency other than U.S. dollars bear interest at a rate equal to the Eurocurrency
Rate plus 1.125% to 2.125%, as determined based on Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Standby letters of credit issued under the credit agreement are subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.125% to 2.125%, based on Quanta’s Consolidated
Leverage Ratio, and Performance Letters of Credit (as defined in the credit agreement) issued under the credit agreement in support of certain contractual obligations are subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.675% to 1.275%, based on Quanta’s
Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Quanta is also subject to a commitment fee of 0.20% to 0.40%, based on its Consolidated Leverage Ratio, on any unused availability under the credit agreement.

The Consolidated Leverage Ratio is the ratio of Quanta’s Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA (as those terms are
defined in the credit agreement). For purposes of calculating Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Funded Indebtedness is reduced by available cash and Cash Equivalents (as defined in the credit agreement) in excess of
$25.0 million. The Base Rate equals the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 0.5%, (ii) the prime rate publicly announced by Bank of America, N.A. and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.00%.

Subject to certain exceptions, the credit agreement is secured by substantially all the assets of Quanta and Quanta’s wholly owned
U.S. subsidiaries and by a pledge of all of the capital stock of Quanta’s wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of direct foreign subsidiaries of Quanta’s wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries. Quanta’s wholly owned
U.S. subsidiaries also guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the credit agreement. Subject to certain conditions, all collateral will automatically be released from the liens at any time Quanta maintains an Investment Grade Rating
(defined in the credit agreement as two of the following three conditions being met: (i) a corporate credit rating that is

BBB-

or higher by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, (ii) a
corporate family rating that is Baa3 or higher by Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. or (iii) a corporate credit rating that is

BBB-

or higher by Fitch Ratings, Inc.).

The credit agreement contains certain covenants, including a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage
Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement). The credit agreement also limits certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, indebtedness, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits liens on
Quanta’s assets. The credit agreement allows

)

cash payments for dividends and stock repurchases subject to compliance with the following requirements (after giving effect to the dividend or stock repurchase): (i) no default or event of
default under the credit agreement; (ii) continued compliance with the financial covenants in the credit agreement; and (iii) at least $100.0 million of availability under the credit agreement and/or cash and cash equivalents on hand.
As of December 31, 2016, Quanta was in compliance with all of the covenants in the credit agreement.

The credit agreement provides
for customary events of default and contains cross-default provisions with Quanta’s underwriting, continuing indemnity and security agreement with its sureties and all of Quanta’s other debt instruments exceeding $100.0 million in
borrowings or availability. If an Event of Default (as defined in the credit agreement) occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the credit agreement, the lenders may declare all amounts outstanding and
accrued and unpaid interest immediately due and payable, require that Quanta provide cash collateral for all outstanding letter of credit obligations, terminate the commitments under the credit agreement, and foreclose on the collateral.

Prior to the amendment and restatement of Quanta’s credit agreement on December 18, 2015 and after April 1, 2014, amounts
borrowed bore interest at the same rates as above, and Quanta was subject to the same commitment fees as above. Prior to April 1, 2014, amounts borrowed in U.S. dollars bore interest, at Quanta’s option, at a rate equal to either
(i) the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.25%, or (ii) the Base Rate plus 0.25%, and amounts borrowed as revolving loans in any currency other than U.S. dollars bore interest at a rate equal to the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.25%. Prior to
April 1, 2014, standby letters of credit issued under the credit agreement were also subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.25%, Performance Letters of Credit issued in support of certain contractual obligations were subject to a letter of
credit fee of 0.75%, and Quanta was also subject to a commitment fee of 0.20% on any unused availability under the credit agreement.

The valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was
$15.0 million, $16.1 million and $13.0 million, respectively. These valuation allowances relate to foreign net operating loss carryforwards, state net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards. The net change
in the total valuation allowance for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was a decrease of $1.1 million, an increase of $3.1 million and a decrease of $0.3 million, respectively. The valuation allowance was
established primarily as a result of uncertainty in Quanta’s outlook as to future taxable income in particular tax jurisdictions. Quanta believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets net of
existing valuation allowances.

At December 31, 2016, Quanta had state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, the tax effect
of which was approximately $40.2 million. These carryforwards will expire as follows: 2017, $0.7 million; 2018, $0.4 million; 2019, $0.8 million; 2020, $0.5 million; 2021, $0.5 million and $37.3 million thereafter.
A valuation allowance of $12.6 million has been recorded against certain foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards.

Through
December 31, 2016, Quanta has not provided U.S. income taxes on approximately $298.8 million of unremitted foreign earnings. If Quanta was to repatriate cash that is indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., it could be subject to
additional U.S income and foreign withholding taxes. Because of the number and variability of assumptions required, it is not practicable to determine the amount of any additional U.S. tax liability that may result if Quanta decides to no
longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings outside the U.S. If Quanta’s intentions or U.S. tax laws change in the future, there may be a significant negative impact on the provision for income taxes and cash flows as a result of recording an
incremental tax liability in the period such change occurs.

Quanta classifies interest and penalties within the provision for income taxes. Quanta recognized interest
income of $3.2 million, interest expense of $2.4 million and interest expense of $0.5 million in the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Although the IRS completed its examination related to tax years 2010, 2011 and 2012 during 2016, certain subsidiaries remain under examination
by various U.S. state, Canadian and other foreign tax authorities for multiple periods. Quanta’s Canadian subsidiaries remain open to examination by the Canada Revenue Agency for tax years 2010 through 2014 as these statute of limitations
periods have not yet expired. Quanta does not consider any state in which it does business to be a major tax jurisdiction.

11.

EQUITY:

Exchangeable Shares and Series F and Series G Preferred Stock

In connection with certain Canadian acquisitions, the former owners of the acquired companies received exchangeable shares of
certain Canadian subsidiaries of Quanta, which may be exchanged at the option of the holders for Quanta common stock on a

one-for-one

basis. The holders of exchangeable
shares can make an exchange only once in any calendar quarter and must exchange a minimum of either 50,000 shares or, if less, the total number of remaining exchangeable shares registered in the name of the holder making the request. Additionally,
in connection with two of such acquisitions, Quanta issued one share of Quanta Series F preferred stock and one share of Quanta Series G preferred stock (the Preferred Stock) to voting trusts on behalf of the respective holders of the
exchangeable shares issued in such acquisitions. Each share of the Preferred Stock provides the holders of such exchangeable shares voting rights in Quanta common stock equivalent to the number of exchangeable shares outstanding at that time.

The holders of exchangeable shares associated with the Preferred Stock have rights equivalent to Quanta common stockholders with respect to
voting, dividends and other economic rights. The holders of exchangeable shares not associated with the Preferred Stock have rights equivalent to Quanta common stockholders with respect to dividends and other economic rights but do not have voting
rights.

)

During 2016, 2015 and 2014, 0.4 million, 0.4 million and no exchangeable shares
were exchanged for Quanta common stock. As of December 31, 2016, both shares of the Preferred Stock remained outstanding and 6.5 million exchangeable shares remained outstanding, of which 3.9 million were associated with the Preferred
Stock.

Treasury Stock

Retirement of Treasury Stock

Effective December 1, 2016, Quanta retired 84.8 million shares of treasury stock. These retired shares were restored to the status of
authorized and unissued shares as permitted by Delaware law. The retired stock had a carrying value of approximately $1.95 billion. In accordance with Quanta’s policy, Quanta recorded the formal retirement of treasury stock by deducting
the par value from common stock and the excess of cost over par value from additional

paid-in

capital.

Shares withheld for tax withholding obligations

Under the stock incentive plans described in Note 12, the tax withholding obligations of employees upon vesting of restricted stock and
RSUs settled in common stock are typically satisfied by Quanta making such tax payments and withholding the number of vested shares having a value on the date of vesting equal to the tax withholding obligation. For the settlement of these employee
tax liabilities, Quanta withheld 0.4 million shares of Quanta common stock during the year ended December 31, 2016, with a total market value of $8.3 million, 0.4 million shares of Quanta common stock during the year ended
December 31, 2015 with a total market value of $10.4 million, and 0.4 million shares of Quanta common stock during the year ended December 31, 2014 with a total market value of $12.3 million. These shares and the related
costs to acquire them were accounted for as adjustments to the balance of treasury stock.

Notional amounts recorded related to
deferred compensation plans

Additionally, Quanta records an amount to treasury stock with an offsetting amount to additional paid in
capital for RSUs that vest and are deferred under Quanta’s deferred compensation plans, which are further described in Note 13, but no shares were recorded as treasury stock shares since the Quanta common stock had not yet been issued.
Distributions of Quanta common stock from the deferred compensation plans are recorded as a reversal of the original entry between treasury stock and additional

paid-in

capital. The net amounts recorded to
treasury stock related to the deferred compensation plans during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $6.8 million, $6.6 million and $0.9 million, respectively, for an aggregate $14.3 million included in
treasury stock at December 31, 2016.

Stock repurchases

During the third quarter of 2015, Quanta’s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing Quanta to purchase, from
time to time through February 28, 2017, up to $1.25 billion of its outstanding common stock (the 2015 Repurchase Program). Repurchases under the 2015 Repurchase Program can be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions,
including pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase arrangement, an issuer repurchase plan or otherwise, at management’s discretion, based on market and business conditions, applicable contractual and legal requirements and other factors. The
2015 Repurchase Program does not obligate Quanta to acquire any specific amount of common stock and may be modified or terminated by Quanta’s board of directors at any time at its sole discretion and without notice. During 2015, Quanta
repurchased 19.2 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $449.9 million in the open market under the 2015 Repurchase Program.



Index to Financial Statements

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

)

Also during the third quarter of 2015, Quanta entered into an accelerated share repurchase
arrangement (the ASR) to repurchase $750.0 million of its common stock under the 2015 Repurchase Program. Under the terms of the ASR, Quanta paid $750.0 million to JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, London Branch (JPMorgan) and
initially received 25.7 million shares of its common stock. The fair market value of these 25.7 million shares at the time of delivery was approximately $600.0 million, and the repurchased shares and the related cost to acquire them
were accounted for as an adjustment to the balance of treasury stock during the quarter ended September 30, 2015, reducing the weighted-average number of basic and diluted common shares used to calculate Quanta’s earnings per share. The
$150.0 million remaining under the ASR was recorded as an adjustment to additional

paid-in

capital (APIC) during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 and was reclassified from APIC to treasury stock
as a result of the final settlement of the ASR on April 12, 2016. Upon final settlement and based on the final volume-weighted average share price during the term of the ASR, minus a discount and subject to other adjustments pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the ASR, Quanta received 9.4 million additional shares of its common stock from JPMorgan. As of December 31, 2016, Quanta had repurchased 54.3 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.20 billion,
and approximately $50.1 million remained available under the 2015 Repurchase Program.

During the fourth quarter of 2013,
Quanta’s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing Quanta to purchase, from time to time through December 31, 2016, up to $500.0 million of its outstanding common stock. During the year ended December 31,
2015, Quanta repurchased 14.3 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $406.5 million in the open market and completed this program.

Other

Under Delaware
corporate law, treasury stock is not counted for quorum purposes or entitled to vote.

Non-controlling

Interests

Quanta holds investments in several joint ventures that provide infrastructure services under specific customer contracts. Quanta has
determined that certain of these joint ventures are VIEs, with Quanta providing the majority of the infrastructure services to the joint venture, which management believes most significantly influences the economic performance of the joint venture.
Management has concluded that Quanta is the primary beneficiary of each of the joint ventures determined to be VIEs and has accounted for each on a consolidated basis. The other parties’ equity interests in these joint ventures have been
accounted for as

non-controlling

interests in the consolidated financial statements. Income attributable to the other joint venture members in the amounts of $1.7 million, $10.9 million and
$18.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, has been accounted for as a reduction of net income in deriving net income attributable to common stock. Equity in the consolidated assets and liabilities of
these joint ventures that is attributable to the other joint venture members has been accounted for as

non-controlling

interests within total equity in the accompanying balance sheets.

The carrying value of the investments held by Quanta in all of its VIEs was approximately $3.3 million and $2.3 million at
December 31, 2016 and 2015. The carrying value of investments held by the

non-controlling

interests in these variable interest entities at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $3.3 million and
$2.3 million. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, distributions to

non-controlling

interests were $0.8 million, $21.2 million and $14.4 million. There were also
contributions received from a joint venture partner of $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no other changes in equity as a result of transfers to/from the

non-controlling

interests during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. See Note 15 for further disclosures related to Quanta’s joint venture arrangements.

EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION:

Stock Incentive Plans

On May 19, 2011, Quanta’s stockholders approved the 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan). The 2011 Plan provides for
the award of

non-qualified

stock options, incentive (qualified) stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, stock bonus awards, performance compensation awards (including performance
units and cash bonus awards) or any combination of the foregoing. The purpose of the 2011 Plan is to attract and retain key personnel and provide participants with additional performance incentives by increasing their proprietary interest in Quanta.
Employees, directors, officers, consultants or advisors of Quanta or its affiliates are eligible to participate in the 2011 Plan, as are prospective employees, directors, officers, consultants or advisors of Quanta who have agreed to serve Quanta in
those capacities. An aggregate of 11,750,000 shares of Quanta common stock may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2011 Plan.

Additionally, pursuant to the Quanta Services, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan), which was adopted on May 24, 2007, Quanta
may award restricted stock, incentive stock options and

non-qualified

stock options to eligible employees, directors, and certain consultants and advisors. An aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of common stock may
be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2007 Plan. Quanta also has a Restricted Stock Unit Plan (the RSU Plan), pursuant to which RSUs may be awarded to certain employees and consultants of Quanta’s Canadian operations.

The 2011 Plan, the 2007 Plan and the RSU Plan, together with certain plans assumed by Quanta in acquisitions, are referred to as the Plans.

The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Quanta. The Compensation Committee has, subject to
applicable regulation and the terms of the Plans, the authority to grant awards under the Plans, to construe and interpret the Plans and to make all other determinations and take any and all actions necessary or advisable for the administration of
the Plans. The Board also delegated to the Equity Grant Committee, a committee of the Board consisting of one or more directors, the authority to grant limited awards to eligible persons who are not executive officers or

non-employee

directors.

Restricted Stock and RSUs to be Settled in Common Stock

During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Quanta granted 1.8 million, 1.3 million and 1.4 million shares of
RSUs to be settled in common stock under the Plans with weighted average grant date fair values of $22.22, $27.64 and $35.08 per share, respectively. The grant date fair value for awards of restricted stock and RSUs to be settled in common stock is
based on the market value of Quanta common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock and RSU awards to be settled in common stock are subject to forfeiture, restrictions on transfer and certain other conditions until vesting, which generally
occurs in equal installments over a

two-year

or three-year period following the date of grant. During the restriction period, holders of restricted stock are entitled to vote and receive dividends on such
shares.

During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, vesting activity consisted of 1.4 million, 1.3 million
and 1.1 million shares of restricted stock and RSUs settled in common stock with an approximate fair value at the time of vesting of $28.9 million, $35.9 million and $37.5 million, respectively.

During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Quanta recognized $39.6 million,
$33.3 million and $35.0 million of

non-cash

stock compensation expense related to restricted stock and RSUs to be settled in common stock. As of December 31, 2016, there was approximately
$29.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs to be settled in common stock granted to both employees and

non-employees.

This cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted average period of 1.52 years.

Performance Units to be Settled in Common Stock

Performance units awarded pursuant to the 2011 Plan provide for the issuance of shares of common stock upon vesting. These performance units
cliff-vest at the end of a three-year performance period based on achievement of three-year company financial performance targets and strategic initiatives established by the Compensation Committee. The final amount of earned and vested performance
units can range from 0% to 200% of the initial amount awarded based on the level of achievement of performance goals, as determined by Quanta’s Compensation Committee.

During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Quanta granted 0.3 million, 0.2 million and 0.1 million of
performance units to be settled in common stock under the 2011 Plan with a weighted average grant date fair value of $22.86, $28.16 and $35.20 per share. The grant date fair value for awards of performance units to be settled in common stock is
based on the market value of Quanta common stock on the date of grant applied to the total number of performance units that Quanta anticipates will become earned and vest. This fair value is expensed ratably over the vesting term and is
adjusted for fair value changes so that the expense recognized for each award is equivalent to the fair value of the final number of earned and vested performance units. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Quanta
recognized $3.2 million, $3.6 million and $2.4 million in compensation expense associated with performance units to be settled in common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no performance units
vested, and no shares of common stock were issued in connection with performance units.

RSUs to be Settled in Cash

Certain RSUs granted by Quanta under the Plans are settled solely in cash. These cash-settled RSUs are intended to provide plan participants
with cash performance incentives that are substantially equivalent to the risks and rewards of equity ownership in Quanta, typically vest in equal installments over a

two-year

or three-year period following
the date of grant, and are subject to forfeiture under certain conditions, primarily termination of service. Additionally, subject to certain restrictions, Quanta’s

non-employee

directors may elect to
cash settle a portion of their RSU awards, which generally vest upon conclusion of the director service year. For

)

all RSUs settled in cash, the holders receive for each vested RSU an amount in cash equal to the fair market value on the settlement date of one share of Quanta common stock, as specified in the
applicable award agreement.

Compensation expense related to RSUs to be settled in cash was $7.0 million, $4.0 million and
$3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Such expense is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. RSUs that are anticipated to be settled in cash are not included in the calculation of earnings
per share, and the estimated earned value of such RSUs is classified as a liability. Quanta paid $4.6 million, $4.2 million and $3.1 million to settle liabilities related to cash-settled RSUs in the years ended December 31, 2016,
2015 and 2014, respectively. Accrued liabilities for the estimated earned value of outstanding RSUs to be settled in cash were $5.1 million and $2.7 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

Unions’ Multiemployer Pension Plans

Quanta contributes to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements with various
unions that represent certain of Quanta’s employees. Quanta’s multiemployer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in the collective bargaining agreements (usually on an annual basis), and contributions are made to the
plans on a

“pay-as-you-go”

basis based on its union employee payrolls. Quanta may also have additional liabilities
imposed by law as a result of its participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities
upon an employer who is a contributor to a multiemployer pension plan if the employer withdraws from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. In the fourth quarter of 2011, Quanta recorded a partial withdrawal liability
related to the withdrawal by certain Quanta subsidiaries from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (Central States Plan) following an amendment to the applicable collective bargaining agreement which eliminated their
obligations to contribute to the Central States Plan. During the first quarter of 2014, Quanta recorded an adjustment to cost of services to increase the recognized withdrawal liability. Additional information regarding this withdrawal, as well as
the withdrawal from the Central States Plan of a company acquired by Quanta in the fourth quarter of 2013, is provided in

Collective Bargaining Agreements

in Note 15.

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) also added special funding and operational rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after
2007 for multiemployer plans that are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status based on multiple factors (including, for example, the plan’s funded percentage, cash flow position and
whether it is projected to experience a minimum funding deficiency). Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, as applicable, which may require additional
contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. Certain plans to which Quanta contributes or may contribute in the future are in “endangered,”
“seriously endangered” or “critical” status. The amount of additional funds, if any, that Quanta may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated due to uncertainty of the future levels of work that
require the specific use of union employees covered by these plans, as well as the future contribution levels and possible surcharges on contributions applicable to these plans.

The following table summarizes plan information relating to Quanta’s participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans,
including company contributions for the last three years, the status under the PPA of the plans and whether the plans are subject to a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan or contribution surcharges. The most recent PPA zone status available
in 2016 and 2015 relates to the plan’s fiscal

year-end

in



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

)

2015 and 2014. Forms 5500 were not yet available for the plan years ending in 2016. The PPA zone status is based on information that Quanta received from the respective plans, as well as publicly
available information on the U.S. Department of Labor website, and is certified by the plan’s actuary. Although multiple factors or tests may result in red zone or yellow zone status, plans in the red zone generally are less than
65 percent funded, plans in the yellow zone generally are less than 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone generally are at least 80 percent funded. Under the PPA, red zone plans are classified as “critical” status,
yellow zone plans are classified as “endangered” status and green zone plans are classified as neither “endangered” nor “critical” status. The “Subject to Financial Improvement/ Rehabilitation Plan” column
indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan or a rehabilitation plan is either pending or has been implemented. The last column lists the expiration dates of Quanta’s collective-bargaining agreements to which the plans are subject.
Total contributions to these plans correspond to the number of union employees employed at any given time and the plans in which they participate and varies depending upon the location and number of ongoing projects at a given time and the need for
union resources in connection with such projects. Information has been presented separately for individually significant plans and in the aggregate for all other plans.

In addition to the contributions made to multiemployer defined benefit pension plans noted above, Quanta also
contributed to multiemployer defined contribution or other benefit plans on behalf of certain union employees. Contributions to union multiemployer defined contribution or other benefit plans by Quanta were approximately $139.3 million,
$147.1 million and $129.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Total contributions made to all of these multiemployer plans for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 correspond to the number of
union employees employed at any given time and the plans in which they participate and varies depending upon the location and number of ongoing projects at a given time and the need for union resources in connection with such projects.

Quanta 401(k) Plan

Quanta maintains a 401(k) plan pursuant to which employees who are not provided retirement benefits through a collective bargaining agreement
may make contributions through a payroll deduction. Quanta makes matching cash contributions of 100% of each employee’s contribution up to 3% of that employee’s salary and 50% of each employee’s contribution between 3% and 6% of such
employee’s salary, up to the maximum amount permitted by law. Contributions to the 401(k) plan by Quanta were approximately $21.9 million, $17.7 million and $13.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans

Quanta maintains nonqualified deferred compensation plans pursuant to which

non-employee

directors and
certain key employees, independent contractors and consultants may defer receipt of some or all of their cash compensation and/or settlement of their equity-based awards, subject to certain limitations. The plan covering key employees provides
for employer matching contributions for certain officers and employees whose benefits under the 401(k) plan are limited by federal tax law. Quanta may also make discretionary employer contributions to that plan. Matching contributions and
discretionary employer contributions are subject to a vesting schedule, provided that vesting accelerates upon a change in control and the participant’s death or retirement. All matching and discretionary employer contributions, whether
vested or not, are forfeited upon a participant’s termination of employment for cause or upon the participant engaging in competition with Quanta or any of its affiliates.

Quanta made contributions to the deferred compensation plans of approximately $1.0 million, $1.0 million and $0.3 million
during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, $19.1 million and $11.7 million were included in other long-term liabilities and $17.9 million and $11.3 million were
included in other long-term assets related to obligations under these plans and related company-owned life insurance policies. Individuals participating in these plans receive distributions of their respective balances based on predetermined payout
schedules or other events and are also able to direct investments made on their behalf among investment alternatives permitted from time to time under the plan.

14.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

Certain of Quanta’s operating units have entered into
related party lease arrangements for operational facilities, typically with prior owners of certain acquired businesses. These lease agreements generally have terms of up to approximately five years and include renewal options. Related party lease
expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $8.7 million, $10.6 million and $8.5 million, respectively.

15.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

Investments in Affiliates and Other Entities

As described in Note 11, Quanta holds investments in certain joint ventures with third parties for the purpose of providing
infrastructure services under certain customer contracts. Losses incurred by these joint ventures are generally shared ratably based on the percentage ownership of the joint venture members. However, each member of the joint venture typically is
jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of the joint venture under the contract with the customer, and therefore can be liable for full performance of the contract with the customer. In circumstances where Quanta’s participation
in a joint venture qualifies as a general partnership, the joint venture partners are jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of the joint venture, including obligations owed to the customer or any other person or entity. Quanta is
not aware of circumstances that would lead to future claims against it for material amounts in connection with these joint and several liabilities.



Index to Financial Statements

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

)

In the joint venture arrangements entered into by Quanta, typically each joint venturer
indemnifies the other party for any liabilities incurred in excess of the liabilities such other party is obligated to bear under the respective joint venture agreement. It is possible, however, that Quanta could be required to pay or perform
obligations in excess of its share if the other joint venturer failed or refused to pay or perform its share of the obligations. Quanta is not aware of circumstances that would lead to future claims against it for material amounts that would not be
indemnified.

During 2014, a limited partnership in which Quanta is a partner was selected for an engineering, procurement and
construction (EPC) electric transmission project to construct approximately 500 kilometers of transmission line and two 500 kV substations. Quanta will provide turnkey EPC services for the entire project. As of December 31, 2016, Quanta had
made aggregate contributions to this unconsolidated affiliate of $13.5 million and had received $2.9 million as a return of capital. Also as of December 31, 2016, Quanta had outstanding additional capital commitments associated with
investments in an unconsolidated affiliate related to this project as follows (in thousands):

A return of capital from unconsolidated affiliates of approximately $42.1 million is anticipated in August 2017 and is not included in these amounts.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2016, Quanta had outstanding capital commitments associated with investments in unconsolidated
affiliates related to planned oil and gas infrastructure projects of approximately $20.5 million, $0.3 million of which is expected to be paid in the first quarter of 2017. The remaining $20.2 million of these capital commitments is
anticipated to be paid by May 31, 2022.

Leases

Quanta leases certain land, buildings and equipment under

non-cancelable

lease agreements, including
related party leases as discussed in Note 14. The terms of these agreements vary from lease to lease, including some with renewal options and escalation clauses. The following schedule shows the future minimum lease payments under these leases

Rent expense related to operating leases was approximately $242.3 million,
$208.5 million and $161.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Quanta has
guaranteed the residual value on certain of its equipment operating leases. Quanta has agreed to pay any difference between this residual value and the fair market value of the underlying asset at the date of termination of the leases. At
December 31, 2016, the maximum guaranteed residual value was approximately $556.5 million. Quanta believes that no significant payments will be made as a result of the difference between the fair market value of the leased equipment and
the guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no assurance that significant payments will not be required in the future.

Committed Expenditures

Quanta has capital commitments for the expansion of its vehicle fleet in order to accommodate manufacturer lead times on certain types of
vehicles. As of December 31, 2016, Quanta issued approximately $22.4 million of production orders with expected delivery dates in 2017. Although Quanta has committed to purchase these vehicles at the time of their delivery, Quanta
anticipates that these orders will be assigned to third party leasing companies and made available to Quanta under certain of its master equipment lease agreements, thereby releasing Quanta from its capital commitments.

Legal Proceedings

Quanta is from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These
actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract and/or property damages, employment-related damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, Quanta records a reserve when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Quanta discloses matters for which management
believes a material loss is at least reasonably possible. Except as otherwise stated below, none of these proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect on Quanta’s consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. In all instances, management has assessed the matter based on current information and made a judgment concerning its potential outcome, giving due consideration to the nature of the claim, the amount and nature
of damages sought and the probability of success. Management’s judgment may prove materially inaccurate, and such judgment is made subject to the known uncertainties of litigation.

Lorenzo Benton v. Telecom Network Specialists, Inc., et al.

In June 2006, plaintiff Lorenzo Benton filed a class action
complaint in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, alleging various wage and hour violations against Telecom Network Specialists (TNS), a former subsidiary of Quanta. Quanta retained liability associated with this matter
pursuant to the terms of Quanta’s sale of TNS in December 2012. Benton seeks to represent a class of workers that includes all persons who worked on certain TNS projects, including individuals that TNS retained through numerous staffing
agencies. The plaintiff class in this matter is seeking damages for unpaid wages, penalties associated with the failure to provide meal and rest periods and overtime wages, interest and attorneys’ fees. In September 2015, the trial court
certified the class as to workers from the various staffing companies at issue. In January 2017, the trial court granted a summary judgment motion filed by the plaintiff class and found that TNS was a joint employer of the class members and that it
failed to provide adequate meal and rest breaks and failed to pay overtime wages. Quanta believes this decision is not in line with controlling law, is in the process of appealing and continues to contest liability in this matter.

Additionally, in November 2007, TNS filed cross complaints for indemnity and breach of contract against the staffing agencies, which employed
many of the individuals in question. In December 2012, the trial court



Index to Financial Statements

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

Continued

)

heard cross-motions for summary judgment filed by TNS and the staffing agencies pertaining to TNS’s demand for indemnity. The court denied TNS’s motion and granted the motions
filed by the staffing agencies. TNS appealed the court’s ruling, and in April 2015, the California Appellate Court reversed the trial court’s decision, vacated its award of attorneys’ fees, and instructed the trial court to
reconsider its earlier ruling on TNS’s indemnity claims. In February 2017, the court denied a new motion for summary judgment filed by the staffing companies and stated that the staffing companies were liable to TNS for any damages owed to
the class members that the staffing companies employed.

Based on review and analysis of the trial court’s rulings, Quanta does not
believe, at this time, that it is probable this matter will result in a material loss. However, the final amount of liability, if any, payable in connection with this matter remains the subject of pending litigation and will ultimately depend on
various factors, including the outcome of Quanta’s appeal of the trial court’s ruling and the solvency of the staffing agencies. Quanta believes the range of reasonably possible loss upon final resolution of this matter is up to
$23 million.

SEC Notice

. On March 10, 2014, the SEC notified Quanta of an inquiry into certain aspects of
Quanta’s activities in certain foreign jurisdictions, including South Africa and the United Arab Emirates. The SEC also requested that Quanta take necessary steps to preserve and retain categories of relevant documents, including those
pertaining to Quanta’s U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act compliance program. The SEC did not allege any violations of law by Quanta or its employees. On October 27, 2016, the SEC notified Quanta that it had concluded its
investigation and, based on the information received, did not intend to pursue further action in connection with this inquiry.

Sunrise
Powerlink Arbitration

. On April 21, 2010, PAR Electrical Contractors, Inc. (PAR), one of Quanta’s wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into a contract with SDG&E to construct a

117-mile

electrical transmission line in Imperial and San Diego Counties, California, known as the Sunrise Powerlink project. In October 2013, Quanta initiated arbitration proceedings against SDG&E alleging breach of contract and seeking compensation for
additional costs incurred on the project. SDG&E filed a counterclaim for breach of contract seeking damages for PAR’s alleged untimely performance. In December 2014, the parties reached an agreement to dismiss the arbitration. The
settlement terms provided for a cash payment by SDG&E to PAR in the amount of $65 million, representing the final amount to compensate PAR for substantially all of the unpaid portion of PAR’s costs incurred on the project. In January
2015, payment was received and the arbitration was dismissed.

For additional information regarding other pending legal proceedings, see

Collective Bargaining Agreements

in this Note 15.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Quanta is subject to concentrations of credit risk related primarily to its cash and cash equivalents and its net receivable position with
customers, which includes amounts related to billed and unbilled accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts net of advanced billings with the same customer. Substantially all of Quanta’s
cash and cash equivalents are managed by what it believes to be high credit quality financial institutions. In accordance with Quanta’s investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest cash and cash equivalents in a diversified
portfolio of what Quanta believes to be high quality investments, which consist primarily of interest-bearing demand deposits, money market investments, money market mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper with original maturities of
three months or less. Although Quanta does not currently believe the principal amount of these investments is subject to any material risk of loss, changes in economic conditions could impact the interest income Quanta receives from these
investments. In addition, Quanta grants credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, to



Index to Financial Statements

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

Continued

)

its customers, which include electric power and oil and gas companies, governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties
located primarily in the United States, Canada and Australia. Consequently, Quanta is subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the United States, Canada and Australia, which may be heightened as
a result of uncertain economic and financial market conditions that have existed in recent years. However, Quanta generally has certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Historically, some of Quanta’s customers have
experienced significant financial difficulties, and others may experience financial difficulties in the future. These difficulties expose Quanta to increased risk related to collectability of billed and unbilled receivables and costs and estimated
earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts for services Quanta has performed.

At December 31, 2016 and 2015, one
customer within Quanta’s Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment accounted for approximately 16% and 12% of Quanta’s consolidated net receivable position. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net receivable position for this
customer was $277.3 million and $195.2 million, which included $175.9 million and $83.9 million of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. These balances were associated with invoicing
challenges and billing delays on two related electric transmission projects located in remote regions of northeastern Canada that resulted from extensive quality assurance documentation and administrative requirements. Quanta continues to work
collaboratively with the customer to improve these processes. The net receivable position also includes change orders and claims that were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business. No other customers represented 10% or
more of Quanta’s consolidated net receivable position as of December 31, 2016 or 2015. No customers represented 10% or more of Quanta’s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Self-Insurance

As
discussed in Note 2, Quanta is insured for employer’s liability, workers’ compensation, auto liability, general liability and group health claims. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the gross amount accrued for insurance claims totaled
$218.2 million and $209.0 million, with $162.0 million and $153.5 million considered to be long-term and included in other

non-current

liabilities. Related insurance recoveries/receivables
as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $8.7 million and $8.6 million, of which $0.4 million and $0.6 million were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $8.3 million and $8.0 million were included
in other assets, net.

Letters of Credit

Certain of Quanta’s vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on its behalf, such as to
beneficiaries under its self-funded insurance programs. In addition, from time to time, certain customers require Quanta to post letters of credit to ensure payment to its subcontractors and vendors and to guarantee performance under its contracts.
Such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution, typically pursuant to Quanta’s credit facility. Each letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if
the holder demonstrates that Quanta has failed to perform specified actions. If this were to occur, Quanta would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement, Quanta may also be
required to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. Quanta does not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future.



Index to Financial Statements

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

Continued

)

As of December 31, 2016, Quanta had $305.6 million in outstanding letters of credit
and bank guarantees under its credit facility to secure its casualty insurance program and various contractual commitments. These are irrevocable

stand-by

letters of credit with maturities generally expiring
at various times throughout 2017. Upon maturity, it is expected that the majority of the letters of credit related to the casualty insurance program will be renewed for subsequent

one-year

periods.

Performance Bonds and Parent Guarantees

In certain circumstances, Quanta is required to provide performance bonds in connection with its contractual commitments. Quanta has
indemnified its sureties for any expenses paid out under these performance bonds. These performance bonds expire at various times ranging from mechanical completion of the related projects to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain
circumstances, and as such a determination of maximum potential amounts outstanding requires the use of certain estimates and assumptions. Such amounts can also fluctuate from period to period based upon the mix and level of Quanta’s bonded
operating activity. As of December 31, 2016, the total amount of the outstanding performance bonds was estimated to be approximately $3.4 billion. Quanta’s estimated maximum exposure as it relates to the value of the performance bonds
outstanding is lowered on each bonded project as the cost to complete is reduced, and each of its commitments under the performance bonds generally extinguishes concurrently with the expiration of its related contractual obligation. The estimated
cost to complete these bonded projects was approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2016.

Additionally, from time to time,
Quanta guarantees the obligations of its wholly owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease obligations and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors’ licenses.
Quanta is not aware of any material obligations for performance or payment asserted against it under any of these guarantees.

Employment Agreements

Quanta has various employment agreements with certain executives and other employees, which provide for compensation and certain other benefits
and for severance payments under certain circumstances. Certain employment agreements also contain clauses that become effective upon a change in control of Quanta, and Quanta may be obligated to pay certain amounts to such employees upon the
occurrence of any of the defined change in control events.

Collective Bargaining Agreements

Some of Quanta’s operating units are parties to various collective bargaining agreements with unions that represent certain of their
employees. The collective bargaining agreements expire at various times and have typically been renegotiated and renewed on terms similar to those in the expiring agreements. From time to time, Quanta is a party to grievance actions based on claims
arising out of the collective bargaining agreements. The agreements require the operating units to pay specified wages, provide certain benefits to their union employees and contribute certain amounts to multiemployer pension plans and employee
benefit trusts. Quanta’s multiemployer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in the collective bargaining agreements (usually on an annual basis), and contributions are made to the plans on a

“pay-as-you-go”

basis based on its union employee payrolls. The location and number of union employees that Quanta employs at any given time and the plans in
which they may participate vary depending on the projects Quanta has ongoing at any time and the need for union resources in connection with those projects. Therefore, Quanta is unable to accurately predict its union employee payroll and the amount
of the resulting multiemployer pension plan contribution obligation for future periods.



Index to Financial Statements

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

)

The PPA also added special funding and operational rules generally applicable to plan years
beginning after 2007 for multiemployer plans that are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status based on multiple factors (including, for example, the plan’s funded percentage, cash
flow position and whether it is projected to experience a minimum funding deficiency). Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, as applicable, which may
require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. Certain plans to which Quanta contributes or may contribute in the future are in
“endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status. The amount of additional funds, if any, that Quanta may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated due to uncertainty of the
future levels of work that require the specific use of union employees covered by these plans, as well as the future contribution levels and possible surcharges on contributions applicable to these plans.

Quanta may be subject to additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of its participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension
plans. For example, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon an employer who is a contributor to a multiemployer pension plan if the
employer withdraws from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. These liabilities include an allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits in the plan for all plan participants, not merely the benefits payable to a
contributing employer’s own retirees. As a result, participating employers may bear a higher proportion of liability for unfunded vested benefits if other participating employers cease to contribute or withdraw, with the reallocation of
liability being more acute in cases when a withdrawn employer is insolvent or otherwise fails to pay its withdrawal liability. Other than as described below, Quanta is not aware of any material amounts of withdrawal liability that have been incurred
as a result of a withdrawal by any of Quanta’s operating units from any multiemployer defined benefit pension plans.

2011 Central
States Plan Withdrawal Liability

. In the fourth quarter of 2011, certain Quanta subsidiaries withdrew from the Central States Plan. This withdrawal event was the result of an amendment to a collective bargaining agreement with the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters (Teamsters) that eliminated certain employers’ obligations to contribute to the Central States Plan, which was then in critical status and significantly underfunded as to its vested benefit obligations. The amendment
was negotiated by the Pipe Line Contractors Association (PLCA) on behalf of its members, which include certain Quanta subsidiaries. Because certain other Quanta subsidiaries continued participation in the Central States Plan into 2012, the Quanta
subsidiaries’ withdrawals in 2011 effected only a partial withdrawal on behalf of Quanta for 2011. Quanta believed that the partial withdrawal was advantageous because it limited exposure to increased liability resulting from a future
withdrawal event, at which point the Central States Plan could have been further underfunded. Quanta and other PLCA members now contribute to a different multiemployer pension plan on behalf of the affected Teamsters employees. While certain
additional Quanta subsidiaries continued participation in the Central States Plan into 2012, Quanta believes that such subsidiaries withdrew from the Central States Plan in 2012, thereby effecting a complete withdrawal as of December 30, 2012
for all Quanta subsidiaries.

In connection with the partial withdrawal in 2011, Quanta recorded a withdrawal liability of approximately
$32.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 based on estimates received from the Central States Plan. The Central States Plan subsequently asserted that the withdrawal of the PLCA members, and thus Quanta’s partial withdrawal, was not
effective in 2011. The PLCA and Quanta believed at that time that a legally effective withdrawal had occurred during the fourth quarter of 2011, and this issue was litigated in the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois,
Eastern Division. In September 2013, the district court ruled in favor of the Central States Plan, and that decision was appealed by the PLCA. In July 2014, the Central States Plan provided Quanta with a Notice and Demand claiming partial withdrawal
liability in the amount of $39.6 million and



Index to Financial Statements

QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (

)

requiring Quanta to make payments on this assessment while the dispute is ongoing. In September 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled in favor of the PLCA and
reversed the district court’s previous ruling which had been in favor of the Central States Plan. Based on the outcome of the appeal, in January 2016, the Central States Plan issued a revised Notice and Demand claiming a partial withdrawal
liability in the amount of $32.9 million.

Separately, in December 2013, the Central States Plan filed lawsuits against two of
Quanta’s other subsidiaries in connection with their withdrawal in 2012. In the first lawsuit, the Central States Plan alleged that the subsidiary elected to participate in the Central States Plan pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement
under which it participated. Quanta argued that no such election was made and that any payments made to the Central States Plan were made in error. In July 2014, the parties reached an agreement to settle the lawsuit, and the court dismissed the
case with prejudice. In the second lawsuit, the Central States Plan alleged that contributions made by the Quanta subsidiary to a new industry fund created after Quanta withdrew from the Central States Plan should have been made to the Central
States Plan. This arguably would have extended the withdrawal date for this subsidiary to at least the end of 2013. Quanta disputed these allegations on the basis that it properly paid contributions to the new industry fund based on the terms of the
collective bargaining agreement under which it participated and asserted that it terminated its obligation to contribute to the Central States Plan by the end of 2012. The parties both moved for summary judgment, and in March 2015, the court entered
judgment in favor of Quanta. The Central States Plan filed a notice of appeal in April 2015, and in December 2015, the Central States Plan agreed to dismiss the appeal with prejudice.

The ultimate liability associated with the complete withdrawal of Quanta’s subsidiaries from the Central States Plan will depend on
various factors, including interpretations of the terms of the collective bargaining agreements under which the subsidiaries participated and whether exemptions from withdrawal liability applicable to construction industry employers will be
available. In March 2014, the Central States Plan provided revised estimates indicating that the total withdrawal liability based on certain withdrawal scenarios from 2011 through 2014 could range between $40.1 million and $55.4 million,
which Quanta believes to be the range of reasonably possible loss for this matter. Additionally, based on those estimates and allowing for the exclusion of amounts believed by management to have been improperly included in such estimate, Quanta
recorded an adjustment to cost of services during the three months ended March 31, 2014 to increase the recognized withdrawal liability to an amount within the range communicated to Quanta by the Central States Plan. Given the unknown nature of
some of the factors mentioned above, the final withdrawal liability cannot yet be determined with certainty. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that the amount owed upon final resolution of these matters could be materially higher than the
expense Quanta had recognized through December 31, 2016. Although Quanta disputes the total liability owed to the Central States Plan, it continues to make monthly payments according to the terms of the January 2016 Notice and Demand while the
parties determine the final withdrawal liability. As of December 31, 2016, Quanta had made payments totaling $17.5 million toward the withdrawal liability assessment.

2013 Central States Plan Withdrawal Liability.

On October 9, 2013, Quanta acquired a company that experienced a complete
withdrawal from the Central States Plan prior to the date of acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, the Central States Plan issued a Notice and Demand to the acquired company claiming a withdrawal liability in the total amount of $6.9 million
and requiring payments to be made on this assessment while the dispute is ongoing. In connection with the acquisition, Quanta recorded an initial liability of $4.8 million related to this withdrawal liability, and a portion of the purchase
price for the acquired company was deposited into an escrow account to fund any withdrawal obligation in excess of the initial liability recorded. In January 2016, the Central States Plan issued a revised Notice and Demand claiming a withdrawal
liability in the amount of $4.8 million. Although Quanta continues to dispute the total liability owed to the Central States Plan, it continues to make monthly payments according to the terms of this revised Notice and Demand while the parties
determine

)

the final withdrawal liability. As of December 31, 2016, payments totaling $3.5 million had been made toward the withdrawal liability assessment.

The final amount of withdrawal liability payable in connection with this matter remains the subject of a pending arbitration proceeding and
will ultimately depend on various factors, including the outcome of the PLCA litigation described above. However, the acquired company’s withdrawal from the Central States Plan is not expected to have a material impact on Quanta’s
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Indemnities

Quanta generally indemnifies its customers for the services it provides under its contracts, as well as other specified liabilities, which may
subject Quanta to indemnity claims and liabilities and related litigation. Additionally, in connection with certain acquisitions and dispositions, Quanta has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in
the future. The indemnities under acquisition or disposition agreements are usually contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December 31, 2016, except as otherwise set forth above in

Legal
Proceedings

, Quanta does not believe any material liabilities for claims exist against it in connection with any of these indemnity obligations.

In the normal course of Quanta’s acquisition transactions, Quanta obtains rights to indemnification from the sellers or former owners of
acquired companies for certain risks, liabilities and obligations arising from their prior operations, such as performance, operational, safety, workforce or tax issues, some of which Quanta may not have discovered during due diligence. However, the
indemnities may not cover all of Quanta’s exposure for such

pre-acquisition

matters, and the indemnitors may be unwilling or unable to pay the amounts owed to Quanta. Accordingly, Quanta may incur
expenses for which it is not reimbursed. Quanta is currently in the process of identifying certain

pre-acquisition

obligations associated with

non-U.S.

payroll taxes
that may be due from a business acquired by Quanta in 2013. As of December 31, 2016, Quanta had recorded $11.4 million as its best estimate of the

pre-acquisition

tax obligations and a corresponding
indemnification asset, as management expects to recover from the indemnity counterparties any amounts that Quanta may be required to pay in connection with any such obligations.

SEGMENT INFORMATION:

Quanta presents its operations under two reportable segments:
(1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services and (2) Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services. This structure is generally based on the broad

end-user

markets for Quanta’s services. See Note 1 for
additional information regarding Quanta’s reportable segments.

Quanta’s segment results are derived from the types of services
provided across its operating units in each of the end user markets described above. Quanta’s entrepreneurial business model allows each of its operating units to serve the same or similar customers and to provide a range of services across end
user markets. Quanta’s operating units are organized into one of two internal divisions, namely, the Electric Power Infrastructure Services Division and the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division. These internal divisions are closely
aligned with the reportable segments described above based on their operating units’ predominant type of work.

Reportable segment
information, including revenues and operating income by type of work, is gathered from each operating unit for the purpose of evaluating segment performance in support of Quanta’s market strategies. These classifications of Quanta’s
operating unit revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the part of management. Quanta’s operating units may perform joint infrastructure service projects for customers in multiple industries,
deliver multiple types of network services under a single customer contract or provide service across industries. For example, Quanta performs joint trenching projects to install distribution lines for electric power and natural gas customers.

In addition, Quanta’s integrated operations and common administrative support at each of
its operating units require that certain allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs and indirect operating expenses, including depreciation and general and administrative costs, be made to determine operating segment
profitability. Corporate costs, such as payroll and benefits, employee travel expenses, facility costs, professional fees, acquisition costs and amortization related to intangible assets are not allocated.

Summarized financial information for Quanta’s reportable segments is presented in the following table (in thousands):

Separate measures of Quanta’s assets and cash flows by reportable segment, including capital
expenditures, are not produced or utilized by management to evaluate segment performance. Quanta’s fixed assets, which are held at the operating unit level, include operating machinery, equipment and vehicles, as well as office equipment,
buildings and leasehold improvements, and are used on an interchangeable basis across its reportable segments. As such, for reporting purposes, total depreciation expense is allocated each quarter among Quanta’s reportable segments based on the
ratio of each reportable segment’s revenue contribution to consolidated revenues.

Foreign Operations

During 2016, 2015, and 2014, Quanta derived $1.59 billion, $1.54 billion and $1.89 billion, respectively, of its revenues from
foreign operations. Of Quanta’s foreign revenues, approximately 75%, 85% and 82% was earned in Canada during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, Quanta held property and equipment of
$320.7 million and $317.6 million in foreign countries, primarily Canada, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

During the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, Quanta recorded total asset impairment charges of
$8.0 million ($7.1 million net of tax) and $58.5 million ($44.6 million net of tax). Quanta recorded asset impairments primarily related to certain international renewable energy services operations of $8.0 million in 2016
and $6.6 million in 2015. The 2016 impairment was primarily due to a pending disposition of certain international renewable energy services operations, and the 2015 impairment was based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows for the
asset group as compared to their carrying value. Also included in the asset impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 were a $39.8 million goodwill impairment and a $12.1 million impairment related to customer
relationships, trade names and

non-compete

agreement intangible assets. These goodwill and intangible impairments primarily resulted from lower levels of expected activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and, to a
lesser extent, due to the extended low commodity price environment with respect to certain directional drilling operations in Australia.

Additionally, during the third quarter of 2015, net income and net income attributable to common stock included an approximate
$171 million gain on the sale, net of tax, of Quanta’s fiber optic licensing operations.

The sum of the individual quarterly
earnings per share amounts may not equal

year-to-date

earnings per share as each period’s computation is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period.

ITEM 9.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

There have been no changes in or disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure within the parameters of
Item 304(b) of

Regulation S-K.

ITEM 9A.

Controls a

nd Procedures

Attached as
exhibits to this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

are certifications of Quanta’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that are required in accordance with

Rule 13a-14

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). This Item 9A. section includes information concerning the controls and controls evaluation referred to in the
certifications, and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.

Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management has established and maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that
are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form

10-K,

is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. The disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to

Rule 13a-15(b)

of the Exchange Act. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on this evaluation, these officers have concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.

Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting can be found in Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data

under the heading

Report of Management

and is incorporated herein by reference. The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, on the financial statements, and its opinion on the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, can also be found in Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

under the heading

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

and is incorporated
herein by reference.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
December 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Design and Operation of Control Systems

Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s
objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances



Index to Financial Statements

of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because of
simple errors or mistakes. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
