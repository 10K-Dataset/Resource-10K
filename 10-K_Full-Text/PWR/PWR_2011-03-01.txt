Business

General

Quanta Services, Inc. (Quanta) is a leading national provider of
    specialty contracting services, offering infrastructure
    solutions to the electric power, natural gas and oil pipeline
    and telecommunications industries. The services we provide
    include the design, installation, upgrade, repair and
    maintenance of infrastructure within each of the industries we
    serve, such as electric power transmission and distribution
    networks, substation facilities, renewable energy facilities,
    natural gas and oil transmission and distribution systems and
    telecommunications networks used for video, data and voice
    transmission. We also design, procure, construct and maintain
    fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure in select markets
    and license the right to use these

point-to-point

fiber optic telecommunications facilities to customers.

We report our results under four reportable segments:
    (1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services,
    (2) Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services,
    (3) Telecommunications Infrastructure Services and
    (4) Fiber Optic Licensing. These reportable segments are
    based on the types of services we provide. Our consolidated
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were
    approximately $3.9 billion, of which 52% was attributable
    to the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment, 36% to
    the Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment, 9%
    to the Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segment and 3%
    to the Fiber Optic Licensing segment.

We have established a presence throughout the United States and
    Canada with a workforce of over 13,700 employees, which enables
    us to quickly, reliably and cost-effectively serve a diversified
    customer base. We believe our reputation for responsiveness and
    performance, geographic reach, comprehensive service offering,
    safety leadership and financial strength have resulted in strong
    relationships with numerous customers, which include many of the
    leading companies in the industries we serve. Our ability to
    deploy services to customers throughout North America as a
    result of our broad geographic presence and significant scale
    and scope of services is particularly important to our customers
    who operate networks that span multiple states or regions. We
    believe these same factors also position us to take advantage of
    potential international opportunities.

We were organized as a corporation in the state of Delaware in
    1997, and since that time we have grown organically and made
    strategic acquisitions, expanding our geographic presence and
    scope of services and developing new capabilities to meet our
    customers’ evolving needs. In particular, in the past three
    years, we have completed two significant acquisitions, as well
    as several smaller acquisitions. On October 25, 2010, we
    acquired Valard Construction LP and certain of its affiliates
    (Valard), an electric power infrastructure services company
    based in Alberta, Canada. This acquisition allows us to further
    expand our electric power infrastructure capabilities and scope
    of services in Canada. On October 1, 2009, we acquired
    Price Gregory Services, Incorporated (Price Gregory), which
    provides natural gas and oil transmission pipeline
    infrastructure services in North America, specializing in the
    construction of large diameter transmission pipelines. This
    acquisition significantly expanded our existing natural gas and
    pipeline operations. We continue to evaluate potential
    acquisitions of companies with strong management teams and good
    reputations to broaden our customer base, expand our geographic
    area of operation and grow our portfolio of services. We believe
    that our financial strength and experienced management team will
    be attractive to acquisition candidates.

We believe that our business strategies, along with our
    competitive and financial strengths, are key elements in
    differentiating us from our competition and position us to
    capitalize on future capital spending by our customers. We offer
    comprehensive and diverse solutions on a broad geographic scale
    and have a solid base of long-standing customer relationships in
    each of the industries we serve. We also have an experienced
    management team, both at the executive level and within our
    operating units, and various proprietary technologies that
    enhance our service offerings. Our strategies of expanding the
    portfolio of services we provide to our existing and potential
    customer base, increasing our geographic and technological
    capabilities, promoting best practices and cross-selling our
    services to our customers, as well as continuing to maintain our
    financial strength, place us in a strong position to capitalize
    upon opportunities and trends in the industries we serve and to
    expand our operations globally.

Reportable
    Segments

The following is an overview of the types of services provided
    by each of our reportable segments and certain of the long-term
    industry trends impacting each segment. With respect to industry
    trends, we and our customers continue to operate in a
    challenging business environment with increasing regulatory
    requirements and only gradual recovery in the economy and
    capital markets from recessionary levels. Economic and
    regulatory issues have adversely affected demand for our
    services, and demand may continue to be impacted as conditions
    slowly improve. Therefore, we cannot predict the timing or
    magnitude that industry trends may have on our business,
    particularly in the near-term.

Electric
    Power Infrastructure Services Segment

The Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment provides
    comprehensive network solutions to customers in the electric
    power industry. Services performed by the Electric Power
    Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design,
    installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power
    transmission and distribution networks and substation facilities
    along with other engineering and technical services. This
    segment also provides emergency restoration services, including
    repairing infrastructure damaged by inclement weather, the
    energized installation, maintenance and upgrade of electric
    power infrastructure utilizing unique bare hand and hot stick
    methods and our proprietary robotic arm technologies, and the
    installation of “smart grid” technologies on electric
    power networks. In addition, this segment designs, installs and
    maintains renewable energy generation facilities, in particular
    solar and wind, and related switchyards and transmission
    networks. To a lesser extent, this segment provides services
    such as the design, installation, maintenance and repair of
    commercial and industrial wiring, installation of traffic
    networks and the installation of cable and control systems for
    light rail lines.

Several industry trends provide opportunities for growth in
    demand for the services provided by the Electric Power
    Infrastructure Services segment, including the need to improve
    the reliability of the aging power infrastructure, the expected
    long-term increase in demand for electric power and the
    incorporation of renewable energy and other new power generation
    sources into the North American power grid. We believe that we
    are the partner of choice for our electric power and renewable
    energy customers in need of broad infrastructure expertise,
    specialty equipment and workforce resources.


Demand for electricity in North America is expected to grow over
    the long-term, however, the electric power grids are aging,
    continue to deteriorate and lack redundancy. The increasing
    demand, coupled with the aging infrastructure, will affect
    reliability, requiring utilities to upgrade and expand their
    existing transmission and distribution systems. Further, current
    federal legislation requires the power industry to meet federal
    reliability standards for its transmission and distribution
    systems. We expect these system upgrades to result in increased
    spending and increased demand for our services over the
    long-term.

We consider renewable energy, including solar and wind, to be
    one of the largest, most rapidly emerging opportunities for our
    engineering, project management and installation services.
    Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the goal of
    reducing reliance on power generation from fossil fuels, are
    creating the need for more renewable energy sources. Renewable
    portfolio standards, which mandate that renewable energy
    constitute a specified percentage of a utility’s power
    generation, exist in many states. Additionally, several of the
    provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
    (ARRA) include incentives for investments in renewable energy,
    energy efficiency and related infrastructure. We believe that
    our comprehensive services, industry knowledge and experience in
    the design, installation and maintenance of renewable energy
    facilities will enable us to support our customers’
    renewable energy efforts.

As demand for power grows, the need for new power generation
    facilities will grow as well. The future development of new
    traditional power generation facilities, as well as renewable
    energy sources, will require new or expanded transmission
    infrastructure to transport power to demand centers. Renewable
    energy in particular often requires significant transmission
    infrastructure due to the remote location of renewable sources
    of energy. As a result, we anticipate that future development of
    new power generation will lead to increased demand over the
    long-term for our electric transmission design and construction
    services and our substation engineering and installation
    services.

Natural
    Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services Segment

The Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment
    provides comprehensive network solutions to customers involved
    in the transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline
    products. Services performed by the Natural Gas and Pipeline
    Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design,
    installation, repair and maintenance of natural gas and oil
    transmission and distribution systems, compressor and pump
    stations and gas gathering systems, as well as related
    trenching, directional boring and automatic welding services. In
    addition, this segment’s services include pipeline
    protection, pipeline integrity and rehabilitation and
    fabrication of pipeline support systems and related structures
    and facilities. To a lesser extent, this segment designs,
    installs and maintains airport fueling systems as well as water
    and sewer infrastructure.

We see potential growth opportunities over the long-term in our
    natural gas operations, primarily in natural gas pipeline
    installation and maintenance services and related services for
    gas gathering systems and pipeline integrity. Ongoing
    development of gas shale formations throughout North America has
    resulted in a significant increase in the natural gas supply as
    compared to several years ago, leading to a reduction in natural
    gas prices from the levels in the 2003 to 2008 period.
    Additionally, as one of the cleanest-burning fossil fuels,
    low-cost natural gas supports the U.S. goals of energy
    independence from foreign energy sources and a cleaner
    environment.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration has stated that the
    number of natural gas-fired power plants built will increase
    significantly over the next two decades. In addition, as
    renewable energy generation continues to increase and become a
    larger percentage of the overall power generation mix, we
    believe natural gas will be the fuel of choice to provide backup
    power generation to offset renewable energy intermittency. We
    also anticipate that the above factors bode well for natural gas
    as a transitional fuel to nuclear power over the next several
    decades.

We believe the existing transmission pipeline infrastructure is
    insufficient to meet this growing natural gas demand even at
    current levels of consumption. For instance, we estimate that it
    would take several years to build the transmission
    infrastructure to connect new sources of natural gas to demand
    centers throughout the U.S. Additional pipeline
    infrastructure is also needed for the transportation of heavy
    crude oil from the Canadian oil sands to refineries, primarily
    those in the coastal region along the Gulf of Mexico, as well as
    oil and other liquids produced from shale formations. Canadian
    oil sands and shale formations in certain parts of the U.S. and
    Canada contain significant reserves, and the economics of the
    production of these reserves depend on the price of oil. Oil
    prices are


currently at a level that encourages the development of these
    oil reserves, which will require pipeline infrastructure to be
    built. We believe that our position as a leading provider of
    transmission pipeline infrastructure services in North America
    will allow us to take advantage of these opportunities.

The U.S. Department of Transportation has also implemented
    significant regulatory legislation through the Pipeline and
    Hazardous Materials Safety Administration relating to pipeline
    integrity requirements that we expect will increase the demand
    for our pipeline integrity and rehabilitation services over the
    long-term.

Telecommunications
    Infrastructure Services Segment

The Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segment provides
    comprehensive network solutions to customers in the
    telecommunications and cable television industries. Services
    performed by the Telecommunications Infrastructure Services
    segment generally include the design, installation, repair and
    maintenance of fiber optic, copper and coaxial cable networks
    used for video, data and voice transmission, as well as the
    design, installation and upgrade of wireless communications
    networks, including towers, switching systems and
    “backhaul” links from wireless systems to voice, data
    and video networks. This segment also provides emergency
    restoration services, including repairing telecommunications
    infrastructure damaged by inclement weather. To a lesser extent,
    services provided under this segment include cable locating,
    splicing and testing of fiber optic networks and residential
    installation of fiber optic cabling.

We believe that certain provisions of the ARRA will continue to
    create demand for our services in this segment over the next few
    years. Specifically, the ARRA includes federal stimulus funding
    for the deployment of broadband services to underserved areas
    that lack sufficient bandwidth to adequately support economic
    development. Approximately $7.2 billion in stimulus funds
    have been awarded for broadband deployment to municipalities,
    states and rural telephone companies, some of which are our
    long-standing customers.

We anticipate increased long-term opportunities arising from
    plans by several wireless companies to transition to 4G and LTE
    (long term evolution) technology, which includes the
    installation of fiber optic “backhaul” to provide
    links from wireless cell sites to broader voice, data and video
    networks. Although fiber to the premise (FTTP) and fiber to the
    node (FTTN) deployment has slowed significantly since 2008, we
    expect fiber optic network build-outs will continue over the
    long-term as more Americans look to next-generation networks for
    faster internet and more robust video services. We believe that
    we are well-positioned to furnish infrastructure solutions for
    these initiatives throughout the United States.

Fiber
    Optic Licensing Segment

The Fiber Optic Licensing segment designs, procures, constructs
    and maintains fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure in
    select markets and licenses the right to use these

point-to-point

fiber optic telecommunications facilities to our customers
    pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with licensing terms
    from five to twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal
    options. Under those agreements, customers are provided the
    right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic
    facility, with the facility owned and maintained by us. The
    Fiber Optic Licensing segment provides services to enterprise,
    education, carrier, financial services and healthcare customers,
    as well as other entities with high bandwidth telecommunication
    needs. The telecommunication services provided through this
    segment are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications
    Commission and certain state public utility commissions.

The growth opportunities in our Fiber Optic Licensing segment
    primarily relate to geographic expansion to serve customers who
    need secure high-speed networks, in particular communications
    carriers and educational, financial services and healthcare
    institutions. These growth opportunities exist in both the
    markets we currently serve, by expanding our existing network to
    add new customers, and expansion into new markets through the
    build-out of new networks. Growth in this segment will generate
    the need for continued significant capital expenditures.

Financial
    Information about Geographic Areas

We operate primarily in the United States; however, we derived
    $256.1 million, $112.2 million and $98.8 million
    of our revenues from foreign operations, the substantial
    majority of which was earned in Canada,


during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. In addition, we held property and equipment in the
    amount of $94.0 million and $57.1 million in foreign
    countries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The increase in
    foreign revenues and assets is primarily due to the Valard and
    Price Gregory acquisitions.

Our business, financial condition and results of operations in
    foreign countries may be adversely impacted by monetary and
    fiscal policies, currency fluctuations, energy shortages,
    regulatory requirements and other political, social and economic
    developments or instability. Refer to Item 1A.

“Risk Factors”

for additional information.

Customers,
    Strategic Alliances and Preferred Provider
    Relationships

Our customers include electric power, natural gas and oil
    pipeline and telecommunications companies, as well as
    commercial, industrial and governmental entities. Our 10 largest
    customers accounted for approximately 39% of our consolidated
    revenues during the year ended December 31, 2010. One
    customer accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. Revenues
    from business with this customer are included in the Natural Gas
    and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment.

Although we have a centralized marketing and business
    development strategy, management at each of our operating units
    is responsible for developing and maintaining successful
    long-term relationships with customers. Our operating unit
    management teams build upon existing customer relationships to
    secure additional projects and increase revenue from our current
    customer base. Many of these customer relationships originated
    decades ago and are maintained through a partnering approach to
    account management that includes project evaluation and
    consulting, quality performance, performance measurement and
    direct customer contact. Additionally, operating unit management
    focuses on pursuing growth opportunities with prospective new
    customers. We encourage operating unit management to cross-sell
    services of other operating units to their customers and to
    coordinate with other operating units to pursue projects,
    especially those that are larger and more complicated. Our
    business development group supports the operating units’
    activities by promoting and marketing our services for existing
    and prospective large national accounts, as well as projects
    that would require services from multiple operating units.

We are a preferred vendor to many of our customers. As a
    preferred vendor, we have met minimum standards for a specific
    category of service, maintained a high level of performance and
    agreed to certain payment terms and negotiated rates. We strive
    to maintain preferred vendor status as we believe it provides us
    an advantage in the award of future work for the applicable
    customer.

We believe that our strategic relationships with customers in
    the electric power, natural gas, oil and telecommunications
    industries will continue to result in future opportunities. Many
    of these strategic relationships take the form of strategic
    alliance or long-term maintenance agreements. Strategic alliance
    agreements generally state an intention to work together, and
    many provide us with preferential bidding procedures. Strategic
    alliances and long-term maintenance agreements are typically
    agreements for an initial term of approximately two to four
    years that may include an option to add extensions at the end of
    the initial term.

Backlog

Backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to
    realize from work to be performed in the future on uncompleted
    contracts, including new contractual agreements on which work
    has not begun. The backlog estimates include amounts under
    long-term maintenance contracts in addition to construction
    contracts. We determine the amount of backlog for work under
    long-term maintenance contracts, or master service agreements
    (MSAs), by using recurring historical trends inherent in the
    current MSAs, factoring in seasonal demand and projected
    customer needs based upon ongoing communications with the
    customer. We also include in backlog our share of work to be
    performed under contracts signed by joint ventures in which we
    have an ownership interest. The following tables


present our total backlog by reportable segment as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, along with an estimate of the
    backlog amounts expected to be realized within 12 months of
    each balance sheet date (in thousands):

As discussed above, our backlog estimates include amounts under
    MSAs. Generally, our customers are not contractually committed
    to specific volumes of services under our MSAs, and many of our
    contracts may be terminated with notice. There can be no
    assurance as to our customers’ requirements or that our
    estimates are accurate. In addition, many of our MSAs, as well
    as contracts for fiber optic licensing, are subject to renewal
    options. For purposes of calculating backlog, we have included
    future renewal options only to the extent the renewals can
    reasonably be expected to occur. Projects included in backlog
    can be subject to delays as a result of commercial issues,
    regulatory requirements, adverse weather and other factors which
    could cause revenue amounts to be realized in periods later than
    originally expected.

Competition

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We
    compete with other contractors in most of the geographic markets
    in which we operate, and several of our competitors are large
    domestic companies that have significant financial, technical
    and marketing resources. In addition, there are relatively few
    barriers to entry into some of the industries in which we
    operate and, as a result, any organization that has adequate
    financial resources and access to technical expertise may become
    a competitor. A significant portion of our revenues is currently
    derived from unit price or fixed price agreements, and price is
    often an important factor in the award of such agreements.
    Accordingly, we could be underbid by our competitors in an
    effort by them to procure such business. The recent economic
    downturn has increased the impacts of competitive pricing in
    certain of the markets that we serve. We believe that as demand
    for our services increases, customers will increasingly consider
    other factors in choosing a service provider, including
    technical expertise and experience, financial and operational
    resources, nationwide presence, industry reputation and
    dependability, which we expect to benefit larger contractors
    such as us. There can be no assurance, however, that our
    competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and
    resources to provide services that are superior in both price
    and quality to our services, or that we will be able to maintain
    or enhance our competitive position. We also face competition
    from the in-house service organizations of our existing or
    prospective customers, including electric power, natural gas and
    pipeline, telecommunications and engineering companies, which
    employ personnel who perform some of the same types of services
    as those provided by us. Although a significant portion of these
    services is currently outsourced by our customers, in particular
    services relating to larger energy transmission infrastructure
    projects, there can be no assurance that our existing or
    prospective customers will continue to outsource services in the
    future.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, we had 2,287 salaried employees,
    including executive officers, professional and administrative
    staff, project managers and engineers, job superintendents and
    clerical personnel, and 11,464 hourly employees, the number of
    which fluctuates depending upon the number and size of the
    projects we undertake at any particular time. Approximately 39%
    of our hourly employees at December 31, 2010 were covered
    by collective bargaining agreements, primarily with the
    International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), the
    Canadian Union Skilled Workers (CUSW) and the four pipeline
    construction trade unions administered by the Pipe Line
    Contractors Association (PLCA), which are the Laborers
    International Union of North America, International


Brotherhood of Teamsters, United Association of Plumbers and
    Pipefitters and the International Union of Operating Engineers.
    These collective bargaining agreements require the payment of
    specified wages to our union employees, the observance of
    certain workplace rules and the payment of certain amounts to
    multi-employer pension plans and employee benefit trusts rather
    than administering the funds on behalf of these employees. These
    collective bargaining agreements have varying terms and
    expiration dates. The majority of the collective bargaining
    agreements contain provisions that prohibit work stoppages or
    strikes, even during specified negotiation periods relating to
    agreement renewal, and provide for binding arbitration dispute
    resolution in the event of prolonged disagreement.

We provide health, welfare and benefit plans for employees who
    are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have a
    401(k) plan pursuant to which eligible employees who are not
    provided retirement benefits through a collective bargaining
    agreement may make contributions through a payroll deduction. We
    make matching cash contributions of 100% of each employee’s
    contribution up to 3% of that employee’s salary and 50% of
    each employee’s contribution between 3% and 6% of such
    employee’s salary, up to the maximum amount permitted by
    law.

Our industry is experiencing a shortage of journeyman linemen in
    certain geographic areas. In response to the shortage and to
    attract qualified employees, we utilize various IBEW and
    National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) training
    programs and support the joint IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program
    which trains qualified electrical workers. Certain of our
    Canadian operations also support the CUSW’s apprenticeship
    programs for training construction and maintenance electricians
    and powerline technicians. We have also established
    apprenticeship training programs approved by the
    U.S. Department of Labor for employees not subject to the
    IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program, as well as additional
    company-wide and project-specific employee training and
    educational programs.

We believe our relationships with our employees and union
    representatives are good.

Materials

Our customers typically supply most or all of the materials
    required for each job. However, for some of our contracts, we
    may procure all or part of the materials required. We purchase
    such materials from a variety of sources and do not anticipate
    experiencing any significant difficulties in procuring such
    materials.

Training,
    Quality Assurance and Safety

Performance of our services requires the use of equipment and
    exposure to conditions that can be dangerous. Although we are
    committed to a policy of operating safely and prudently, we have
    been and will continue to be subject to claims by employees,
    customers and third parties for property damage and personal
    injuries resulting from performance of our services. Our
    operating units have established comprehensive safety policies,
    procedures and regulations and require that employees complete
    prescribed training and service programs prior to performing
    more sophisticated and technical jobs, which is in addition to
    those programs required, if applicable, by the IBEW/NECA
    Apprenticeship Program, the training programs sponsored by the
    four trade unions administered by the PLCA, the apprenticeship
    training programs sponsored by the CUSW or our equivalent
    programs. Under the IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program, all
    journeyman linemen are required to complete a minimum of
    7,000 hours of

on-the-job

training, approximately 200 hours of classroom education
    and extensive testing and certification. Certain of our
    operating units have established apprenticeship training
    programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor that
    prescribe equivalent training requirements for employees who are
    not otherwise subject to the requirements of the IBEW/NECA
    Apprenticeship Program. Similarly, the CUSW offers
    apprenticeship training for construction and maintenance
    electricians that requires five terms of 1700 hours each,
    combining classroom and on-the-job training, as well as training
    for powerline technicians that also involves classroom and
    jobsite training over a four-year period. In addition, the
    Laborers International Union of North America, International
    Brotherhood of Teamsters, United Association of Plumbers and
    Pipefitters and the International Union of Operating Engineers
    have training programs specifically designed for developing and
    improving the skills of their members who work in the pipeline
    construction industry. Our operating units also benefit from
    sharing best practices regarding their training and educational
    programs and comprehensive safety policies and regulations.

Regulation

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and
    international laws and regulations including:

•

licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to
    contractors, electricians and engineers;


•

regulations relating to worker safety and environmental
    protection;

•

permitting and inspection requirements applicable to
    construction projects;

•

wage and hour regulations;

•

regulations relating to transportation of equipment and
    materials, including licensing and permitting requirements;

•

building and electrical codes;

•

telecommunications regulations relating to our fiber optic
    licensing business; and

•

special bidding, procurement and other requirements on
    government projects.

We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our
    operations and that we are in substantial compliance with
    applicable regulatory requirements. Our failure to comply with
    applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or
    revocation of our operating licenses, as well as give rise to
    termination or cancellation rights under our contracts or
    disqualify us from future bidding opportunities.

Environmental
    Matters and Climate Change Impacts

We are committed to the protection of the environment and train
    our employees to perform their duties accordingly. We are
    subject to numerous federal, state, local and international
    environmental laws and regulations governing our operations,
    including the handling, transportation and disposal of
    non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as
    emissions and discharges into the environment, including
    discharges to air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We also
    are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and
    cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into
    the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations,
    such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of previously owned
    or operated properties, or properties to which hazardous
    substances or wastes were sent by current or former operations
    at our facilities, regardless of whether we directly caused the
    contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or
    disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or
    wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely
    affect our ability to sell, lease or use our properties as
    collateral for financing. In addition, we could be held liable
    for significant penalties and damages under certain
    environmental laws and regulations and also could be subject to
    a revocation of our licenses or permits, which could materially
    and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our
    contracts with our customers may also impose liabilities on us
    regarding environmental issues that arise through the
    performance of our services.

From time to time, we may incur costs and obligations for
    correcting environmental noncompliance matters and for
    remediation at or relating to certain of our properties. We
    believe that we are in substantial compliance with our
    environmental obligations to date and that any such obligations
    will not have a material adverse effect on our business or
    financial performance.

The potential physical impacts of climate change on our
    operations are highly uncertain. Climate change may result in,
    among other things, changes in rainfall patterns, storm patterns
    and intensities and temperature levels. As discussed elsewhere
    in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

including in Item 1A.

“Risk Factors”

, our
    operating results are significantly influenced by weather.
    Therefore, significant changes in historical weather patterns
    could significantly impact our future operating results. For
    example, if climate change results in drier weather and more
    accommodating temperatures over a greater period of time in a
    given period, we may be able to increase our productivity, which
    could have a positive impact on our revenues and gross margins.
    In addition, if climate change results in an increase in severe
    weather, such as hurricanes and ice storms, we could experience
    a greater amount of higher margin emergency restoration service
    work, which generally has a positive impact on our gross
    margins. Conversely, if climate change results in a greater
    amount of rainfall, snow, ice or other less accommodating
    weather conditions in a given period, we could experience
    reduced productivity, which could negatively impact our revenues
    and gross margins.


Risk
    Management and Insurance

We are insured for employer’s liability, general liability,
    auto liability and workers’ compensation claims. Since
    August 1, 2009, all policy deductible levels are
    $5.0 million per occurrence, other than employer’s
    liability, which is subject to a deductible of
    $1.0 million. We also have employee healthcare benefit
    plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining
    agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible
    of $350,000 per claimant per year. For the policy year ended
    July 31, 2009, employer’s liability claims were
    subject to a deductible of $1.0 million per occurrence,
    general liability and auto liability claims were subject to a
    deductible of $3.0 million per occurrence, and
    workers’ compensation claims were subject to a deductible
    of $2.0 million per occurrence. Additionally, for the
    policy year ended July 31, 2009, our workers’
    compensation claims were subject to an annual cumulative
    aggregate liability of up to $1.0 million on claims in
    excess of $2.0 million per occurrence. Our deductibles were
    generally lower in periods prior to August 1, 2008.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported
    and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
    assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance
    liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
    factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of
    damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to
    other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The
    accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and
    management believes such accruals are adequate. As of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the gross amount accrued for
    insurance claims totaled $216.8 million and
    $184.7 million, with $164.3 million and
    $130.1 million considered to be long-term and included in
    other non-current liabilities. Related insurance
    recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2010 and 2009
    were $66.3 million and $33.7 million, of which
    $9.4 million and $13.4 million are included in prepaid
    expenses and other current assets and $56.9 million and
    $20.3 million are included in other assets, net.

We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and
    therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may
    change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel our
    coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or
    the cost to obtain such coverage may become unreasonable. In any
    such event, our overall risk exposure would increase, which
    could negatively affect our results of operations, financial
    condition and cash flows.

Seasonality
    and Cyclicality

Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to
    seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced
    by weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, project
    timing and schedules and holidays. Typically, our revenues are
    lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or
    wet conditions cause delays in projects. The second quarter is
    typically better than the first, as some projects begin, but
    continued cold and wet weather can often impact second quarter
    productivity. The third quarter is typically the best of the
    year, as a greater number of projects are underway and weather
    is more accommodating to work on projects. Generally, revenues
    during the fourth quarter of the year are lower than the third
    quarter but higher than the second quarter. Many projects are
    completed in the fourth quarter, and revenues are often impacted
    positively by customers seeking to spend their capital budgets
    before the end of the year; however, the holiday season and
    inclement weather can sometimes cause delays, reducing revenues
    and increasing costs. Any quarter may be positively or
    negatively affected by atypical weather patterns in a given part
    of the country such as severe weather, excessive rainfall or
    warmer winter weather, making it difficult to predict these
    variations

quarter-to-quarter

and their effect on particular projects.

Additionally, our industry can be highly cyclical. As a result,
    our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines or
    delays in new projects in various geographic regions in the
    United States and Canada. Project schedules, in particular in
    connection with larger, longer-term projects, can also create
    fluctuations in the services provided, which may adversely
    affect us in a given period. The financial condition of our
    customers and their access to capital, variations in the margins
    of projects performed during any particular period, regional,
    national and global economic and market conditions, timing of
    acquisitions, the timing and magnitude of acquisition and
    integration costs associated with acquisitions and interest rate
    fluctuations may also materially affect quarterly results.
    Accordingly, our operating results in any particular period may
    not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any
    other period. You should read

Risk
    Factors

Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties,
    including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties
    described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are
    not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not known to us or not described below also may
    impair our business operations. If any of the following risks
    actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of
    operations could be negatively affected and we may not be able
    to achieve our goals or expectations. This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

also includes statements reflecting assumptions, expectations,
    projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are
    intended as “forward-looking statements” under the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be

“Uncertainty of Forward-Looking Statements and
    Information”

included in Item 7.

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.”

Our
    operating results may vary significantly from quarter to
    quarter.

Our business can be highly cyclical and subject to seasonal and
    other variations that can result in significant differences in
    operating results from quarter to quarter. For example, we
    typically experience lower gross and operating margins during
    winter months due to lower demand for our services and more
    difficult operating conditions. Additionally, our quarterly
    results may be materially and adversely affected by:

•

variations in the margins of projects performed during any
    particular quarter;

•

unfavorable regional, national or global economic and market
    conditions;

•

a reduction in the demand for our services;

•

the budgetary spending patterns of customers;

•

increases in construction and design costs;

•

the timing and volume of work we perform;

•

the effects of adverse or favorable weather conditions;

•

permitting, regulatory or customer-caused delays;

•

the magnitude of work performed under change orders and the
    timing of their recognition;


•

the termination or expiration of existing agreements;

•

pricing pressures resulting from competition;

•

losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by
    insurance;

•

a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;

•

payment risk associated with the financial condition of our
    customers;

•

changes in bonding and lien requirements applicable to existing
    and new agreements;

•

implementation of various information systems, which could
    temporarily disrupt

day-to-day

operations;

•

the recognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax
    positions;

•

decreases in interest rates we receive on our cash and cash
    equivalents;

•

changes in accounting pronouncements that require us to account
    for items differently than historical pronouncements have;

•

costs we incur to support growth internally or through
    acquisitions or otherwise;

•

the timing and integration of acquisitions and the magnitude of
    the related acquisition and integration costs; and

•

the timing and significance of potential impairments of
    long-lived assets, goodwill or other intangible assets.

Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may
    not be indicative of the results that you can expect for any
    other quarter or for the entire year.

Negative
    economic and market conditions may adversely impact our
    customers’ future spending as well as payment for our
    services and, as a result, our operations and
    growth.

The economy is still recovering from the recent recession, and
    economic growth remains slow. The financial markets also have
    not fully recovered. It is uncertain when these conditions will
    significantly improve. Stagnant or declining economic conditions
    have adversely impacted the demand for our services and resulted
    in the delay, reduction or cancellation of certain projects and
    may continue to adversely affect us in the future. Additionally,
    many of our customers finance their projects through the
    incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. The availability
    of credit remains constrained, and many of our customers’
    equity values have not fully recovered from the negative impact
    of the recession. A reduction in cash flow or the lack of
    availability of debt or equity financing may continue to result
    in a reduction in our customers’ spending for our services
    and may also impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts
    owed to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    operations and our ability to grow at historical levels.

Economic
    conditions and regulatory requirements affecting any of the
    industries we serve may lead to less demand for our
    services.

Because the vast majority of our revenue is derived from a few
    industries, a downturn in economic conditions in any of those
    industries would adversely affect our results of operations.
    Specifically, unfavorable economic conditions in any industry we
    serve could result in the delay, reduction or cancellation of
    projects by our customers as well as cause our customers to
    outsource less work. Customers in the industries we serve may
    also face increased regulatory requirements as they implement
    plans for their projects, which could result in the delay,
    reduction or cancellation of these projects. These economic and
    regulatory factors may result in decreased demand for our
    services and potentially impact our operations and our ability
    to grow at historical levels. A number of other factors,
    including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the
    industries we serve or a prolonged economic downturn or
    recession, could adversely affect our customers and their
    ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the
    future or pay for past services. For example, our
    Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segment has been
    negatively impacted since mid-2008 by the slowdown in fiber
    deployment initiatives from customers such as AT&T and
    Verizon, and we expect this slowdown will likely continue. We
    continue to see


reduced spending in electric and natural gas distribution work
    under our Electric Power Infrastructure Services and Natural Gas
    and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segments due to capital
    expenditure reductions by our customers. Customers also delayed
    certain projects involving services under our Electric Power and
    Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segments due to
    regulatory requirements, such as permitting or environmental
    approvals. Another area of business under our Natural Gas and
    Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment, gas gathering and
    pipeline installation and maintenance, declined during 2009 and
    2010, which we believe is due to lower natural gas prices and
    capital constraints on spending by our customers. Consolidation,
    competition, capital constraints or negative economic conditions
    in the electric power, natural gas, oil and telecommunications
    industries may also result in reduced spending by, or the loss
    of, one or more of our customers.

Project
    performance issues, including those caused by third parties, or
    certain contractual obligations may result in additional costs
    to us, reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated
    damages.

Many projects involve challenging engineering, procurement and
    construction phases that may occur over extended time periods,
    sometimes over several years. We may encounter difficulties as a
    result of delays in designs, engineering information or
    materials provided by the customer or a third party, delays or
    difficulties in equipment and material delivery, schedule
    changes, delays from our customer’s failure to timely
    obtain permits or

rights-of-way

or meet other regulatory requirements, weather-related delays
    and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, that
    impact our ability to complete the project in accordance with
    the original delivery schedule. In addition, we occasionally
    contract with third-party subcontractors to assist us with the
    completion of contracts. Any delay or failure by suppliers or by
    subcontractors in the completion of their portion of the project
    may result in delays in the overall progress of the project or
    may cause us to incur additional costs, or both. We also may
    encounter project delays due to local opposition, which may
    include injunctive actions as well as public protests, to the
    siting of electric power, natural gas or oil transmission lines,
    solar or wind projects, or other facilities. Delays and
    additional costs may be substantial and, in some cases, we may
    be required to compensate the customer for such delays. We may
    not be able to recover all of such costs. In certain
    circumstances, we guarantee project completion by a scheduled
    acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and
    performance testing levels. Failure to meet any of our schedules
    or performance requirements could also result in additional
    costs or penalties, including liquidated damages, and such
    amounts could exceed expected project profit. In extreme cases,
    the above-mentioned factors could cause project cancellations,
    and we may not be able to replace such projects with similar
    projects or at all. Such delays or cancellations may impact our
    reputation or relationships with customers, adversely affecting
    our ability to secure new contracts.

Our customers may change or delay various elements of the
    project after its commencement or the project schedule or the
    design, engineering information, equipment or materials that are
    to be provided by the customer or other parties may be deficient
    or delivered later than required by the project schedule,
    resulting in additional direct or indirect costs. Under these
    circumstances, we generally negotiate with the customer with
    respect to the amount of additional time required and the
    compensation to be paid to us. We are subject to the risk that
    we may be unable to obtain, through negotiation, arbitration,
    litigation or otherwise, adequate amounts to compensate us for
    the additional work or expenses incurred by us due to
    customer-requested change orders or failure by the customer to
    timely deliver items, such as engineering drawings or materials,
    required to be provided by the customer. Litigation or
    arbitration of claims for compensation may be lengthy and
    costly, and it is often difficult to predict when and for how
    much the claims will be resolved. A failure to obtain adequate
    compensation for these matters could require us to record a
    reduction to amounts of revenue and gross profit recognized in
    prior periods under the

percentage-of-completion

accounting method. Any such adjustments could be substantial. We
    may also be required to invest significant working capital to
    fund cost overruns while the resolution of claims is pending,
    which could adversely affect liquidity and financial results in
    any given period.

Under our contracts with our customers, we typically provide a
    warranty for the services we provide, guaranteeing the work
    performed against defects in workmanship and material. The
    majority of our contracts have a warranty period of
    12 months. As much of the work we perform is inspected by
    our customers for any defects in construction prior to
    acceptance of the project, the warranty claims that we have
    historically received have been minimal. Additionally, materials
    used in construction are often provided by the customer or are
    warranted against


defects from the supplier. However, certain projects, such as
    utility-scale solar facilities, may have longer warranty periods
    and include facility performance warranties that may be broader
    than the warranties we generally provide. In these
    circumstances, if warranty claims occurred, it could require us
    to re-perform the services or to repair or replace the warranted
    item, at a cost to us, and could also result in other damages if
    we are not able to adequately satisfy our warranty obligations.
    In addition, we may be required under contractual arrangements
    with our customers to warrant any defects or failures in
    materials we provide that we purchase from third parties. While
    we generally require the materials suppliers to provide us
    warranties that are consistent with those we provide to the
    customers, if any of these suppliers default on their warranty
    obligations to us, we may incur costs to repair or replace the
    defective materials for which we are not reimbursed. Costs
    incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect
    our operating results and financial condition.

Our
    use of fixed price contracts could adversely affect our business
    and results of operations.

We currently generate a portion of our revenues under fixed
    price contracts. We also expect to generate a greater portion of
    our revenues under this type of contract in the future as larger
    projects, such as electric power and pipeline transmission
    build-outs and utility-scale solar facilities, become a more
    significant aspect of our business. We must estimate the costs
    of completing a particular project to bid for fixed price
    contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, may
    vary from the costs we originally estimated, and we may bear the
    risk of certain unforeseen circumstances not included in our
    cost estimates for which we cannot obtain adequate compensation.
    These variations, along with other risks inherent in performing
    fixed price contracts, may cause actual revenue and gross
    profits for a project to differ from those we originally
    estimated and could result in reduced profitability or losses on
    projects. Depending upon the size of a particular project,
    variations from the estimated contract costs could have a
    significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal
    period.

Our
    use of

percentage-of-completion

accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of
    previously reported profits.

As discussed in Item 7.

“Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Critical Accounting Policies”

and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements
    included in Item 8. “

Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data

”, a significant portion of our
    revenues are recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting, utilizing the

cost-to-cost

method. This method is used because management considers
    expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on
    these contracts. This accounting method is generally accepted
    for fixed price contracts. The

percentage-of-completion

accounting practice we use results in our recognizing contract
    revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in
    proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or
    losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates
    of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses
    are recognized in full when determined to be probable and
    reasonably estimatable, and contract profit estimates are
    adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability.
    Further, a substantial portion of our contracts contain various
    cost and performance incentives. Penalties are recorded when
    known or finalized, which generally occurs during the latter
    stages of the contract. In addition, we record cost recovery
    claims when we believe recovery is probable and the amounts can
    be reasonably estimated. Actual collection of claims could
    differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or
    elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain
    circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be
    significant.

Our
    operating results can be negatively affected by weather
    conditions.

We perform substantially all of our services in the outdoors. As
    a result, adverse weather conditions, such as rainfall or snow,
    may affect our productivity in performing our services or may
    temporarily prevent us from performing services. The effect of
    weather delays on projects that are under fixed price
    arrangements may be greater if we are unable to adjust the
    project schedule for such delays. A reduction in our
    productivity in any given period or our inability to meet
    guaranteed schedules may adversely affect the profitability of
    our projects, and as a result, our results of operations.


We may
    be unsuccessful at generating internal growth.

Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by,
    among other factors, our ability to:

•

expand the range of services we offer to customers to address
    their evolving network needs;

•

attract new customers;

•

increase the number of projects performed for existing customers;

•

hire and retain qualified employees;

•

expand geographically, including internationally; and

•

address the challenges presented by difficult economic or market
    conditions that may affect us or our customers.

In addition, our customers may cancel or delay or reduce the
    number or size of projects available to us due to their
    inability to obtain capital or pay for services provided, the
    risk of which increases during unfavorable economic conditions,
    such as those experienced in the past two years. Many of the
    factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be
    beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies
    for achieving internal growth will be successful.

Our
    business is highly competitive.

The specialty contracting business is served by numerous small,
    owner-operated private companies, some public companies and
    several large regional companies. In addition, relatively few
    barriers prevent entry into some areas of our business. As a
    result, any organization that has adequate financial resources
    and access to technical expertise may become one of our
    competitors. Competition in the industry depends on a number of
    factors, including price. For example, we are currently
    experiencing the impacts of competitive pricing in certain of
    the markets we serve, such as the electric power market with
    respect to smaller scale transmission projects and distribution
    services. Certain of our competitors may have lower overhead
    cost structures and, therefore, may be able to provide their
    services at lower rates than we are able to provide. In
    addition, some of our competitors have significant resources,
    including financial, technical and marketing resources. We
    cannot be certain that our competitors do not have or will not
    develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide
    services that are superior in both price and quality to our
    services. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able
    to maintain or enhance our competitive position within the
    specialty contracting business or maintain our customer base at
    current levels. We also may face competition from the in-house
    service organizations of our existing or prospective customers.
    Electric power, natural gas, oil and telecommunications service
    providers usually employ personnel who perform some of the same
    types of services we do, and we cannot be certain that our
    existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource
    services in the future.

Legislative
    actions and initiatives relating to renewable energy,
    telecommunications and electric power may fail to result in
    increased demand for our services.

Demand for our services may not result from renewable energy
    initiatives. While many states currently have mandates in place
    that require specified percentages of power to be generated from
    renewable sources, states could reduce those mandates or make
    them optional, which could reduce, delay or eliminate renewable
    energy development in the affected states. Additionally,
    renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce and may
    require additional power generation sources as backup. The
    locations of renewable energy projects are often remote and are
    not viable unless new or expanded transmission infrastructure to
    transport the power to demand centers is economically feasible.
    Furthermore, funding for renewable energy initiatives may not be
    available, which has been further constrained as a result of
    tight credit markets. These factors have resulted in fewer
    renewable energy projects than anticipated and a delay in the
    construction of these projects and the related infrastructure,
    which has adversely affected the demand for our services. These
    factors could continue to result in delays or reductions in
    projects, which could further negatively impact our business.

The ARRA provides for various stimulus programs, such as grants,
    loan guarantees and tax incentives, relating to renewable
    energy, energy efficiency and electric power and
    telecommunications infrastructure. While a


significant amount of stimulus funds have been awarded, we
    cannot predict the timing and scope of any investments to be
    made under stimulus funding or whether stimulus funding will
    result in increased demand for our services. Investments for
    renewable energy, electric power infrastructure and
    telecommunications fiber deployment under ARRA programs may not
    occur, may be less than anticipated or may be delayed, any of
    which would negatively impact demand for our services.

Other current and potential legislative or regulatory
    initiatives may not result in increased demand for our services.
    Examples include legislation or regulations to require utilities
    to meet reliability standards, to ease siting and right-of-way
    issues for the construction of transmission lines, and to
    encourage installation of new electric power transmission and
    renewable energy generation facilities. It is not certain
    whether existing legislation will create sufficient incentives
    for new projects, when or if proposed legislative initiatives
    will be enacted or whether any potentially beneficial provisions
    will be included in the final legislation.

There are also a number of legislative and regulatory proposals
    to address greenhouse gas emissions, which are in various phases
    of discussion or implementation. The outcome of federal and
    state actions to address global climate change could negatively
    affect the operations of our customers through costs of
    compliance or restraints on projects, which could reduce their
    demand for our services.

We are
    self-insured against potential liabilities.

Although we maintain insurance policies with respect to
    employer’s liability, general liability, auto and
    workers’ compensation claims, those policies are subject to
    deductibles ranging from $1.0 million to $5.0 million
    per occurrence depending on the insurance policy. We are
    primarily self-insured for all claims that do not exceed the
    amount of the applicable deductible. We also have employee
    health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is
    subject to a deductible of $350,000 per claimant per year. Our
    insurance policies include various coverage requirements,
    including the requirement to give appropriate notice. If we fail
    to comply with these requirements, our coverage could be denied.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported
    and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
    assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance
    liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
    factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of
    damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to
    other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The
    accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and
    management believes such accruals are adequate. If we were to
    experience insurance claims or costs significantly above our
    estimates, our results of operations could be materially and
    adversely affected in a given period.

During
    the ordinary course of our business, we may become subject to
    lawsuits or indemnity claims, which could materially and
    adversely affect our business and results of
    operations.

We have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a
    defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings during
    the ordinary course of our business. These actions may seek,
    among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury,
    workers’ compensation, employment discrimination, breach of
    contract, property damage, environmental liabilities, punitive
    damages, and civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or
    declaratory relief. In addition, we generally indemnify our
    customers for claims related to the services we provide and
    actions we take under our contracts with them, and, in some
    instances, we may be allocated risk through our contract terms
    for actions by our customers or other third parties. Because our
    services in certain instances may be integral to the operation
    and performance of our customers’ infrastructure, we have
    been and may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any
    failure of the systems that we work on, even if our services are
    not the cause of such failures, and we could be subject to civil
    and criminal liabilities to the extent that our services
    contributed to any property damage, personal injury or system
    failure. The outcome of any of these lawsuits, claims or legal
    proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of
    management’s attention to the business. Payments of
    significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely affect
    our reputation, liquidity and results of operations. For details
    on our existing litigation and claims, refer to Note 14 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”


Unavailability
    or cancellation of third party insurance coverage would increase
    our overall risk exposure as well as disrupt our
    operations.

We maintain insurance coverage from third party insurers as part
    of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our
    contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage
    limits. There can be no assurance that any of our existing
    insurance coverage will be renewed upon the expiration of the
    coverage period or that future coverage will be affordable at
    the required limits. In addition, our third party insurers could
    fail, suddenly cancel our coverage or otherwise be unable to
    provide us with adequate insurance coverage. If any of these
    events occur, our overall risk exposure would increase and our
    operations could be disrupted. For example, we have significant
    operations in California, which has an environment conducive to
    wildfires. Should our insurer determine to exclude coverage for
    wildfires in the future, we could be exposed to significant
    liabilities and potentially a disruption of our California
    operations. If our risk exposure increases as a result of
    adverse changes in our insurance coverage, we could be subject
    to increased claims and liabilities that could negatively affect
    our results of operations and financial condition.

Many
    of our contracts may be canceled on short notice or may not be
    renewed upon completion or expiration, and we may be
    unsuccessful in replacing our contracts in such events, which
    may adversely affect our results of operations and financial
    condition.

We could experience a decrease in our revenue, net income and
    liquidity if any of the following occur:

•

our customers cancel a significant number of contracts or
    contracts having significant value;

•

we fail to renew a significant number of our existing contracts;

•

we complete a significant number of non-recurring projects and
    cannot replace them with similar projects; or

•

we fail to reduce operating and overhead expenses consistent
    with any decrease in our revenue.

Many of our customers may cancel our contracts on short notice,
    typically 30 to 90 days, even if we are not in default
    under the contract. Certain of our customers assign work to us
    on a

project-by-project

basis under master service agreements. Under these agreements,
    our customers often have no obligation to assign a specific
    amount of work to us. Our operations could decline significantly
    if the anticipated volume of work is not assigned to us, which
    will be more likely if customer spending continues to decrease,
    for example, due to the slow recovery of the economy and the
    financial markets. Many of our contracts, including our master
    service agreements, are opened to public bid at the expiration
    of their terms. There can be no assurance that we will be the
    successful bidder on our existing contracts that come up for
    re-bid.

The
    loss of one or a few customers could have an adverse effect on
    us.

A few clients have in the past and may in the future account for
    a significant portion of our revenue in any one year or over a
    period of several consecutive years. Although we have
    long-standing relationships with many of our significant
    clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce or discontinue
    their contracts with us at any time. Our loss of business from a
    significant client could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our
    profitability and financial condition may be adversely affected
    by risks associated with the natural gas and oil industry, such
    as price fluctuations and supply and demand for natural
    gas.

Certain of our services, in particular those under our Natural
    Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment, are exposed to
    risks associated with the natural gas and oil industry. These
    risks, which are not subject to our control, include the
    volatility of natural gas and oil prices, the lack of demand for
    power generation from natural gas and a slowdown in the
    discovery or development of natural gas

and/or

oil
    reserves. Specifically, lower natural gas and oil prices
    generally result in decreased spending by our customers in our
    Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment. While
    higher natural gas and oil prices generally result in increased
    infrastructure spending by these customers, sustained high
    energy prices could be an impediment to economic growth and
    could result in reduced infrastructure spending by such
    customers. Additionally, higher prices will likely reduce demand
    for power


generation from natural gas, which could result in decreased
    demand for the expansion of North America’s natural gas
    pipeline infrastructure, and consequently result in less capital
    spending by these customers and less demand for our services.

Further, if the discovery or development of natural gas

and/or

oil
    reserves slowed or stopped, customers would likely reduce
    capital spending on transmission pipelines, gas gathering and
    compressor systems and other related infrastructure, resulting
    in less demand for our services. If the profitability of our
    business under Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services
    segment were to decline, our overall profitability, results of
    operations and cash flows could also be adversely affected.

Our
    business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and
    retain qualified employees.

Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will
    be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled
    personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We cannot be
    certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled
    labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our
    growth strategy. For instance, we may experience shortages of
    qualified journeyman linemen, who are integral to the provision
    of transmission and distribution services under our Electric
    Power Infrastructure Services segment. In addition, in our
    Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment, there
    is limited availability of experienced supervisors and foremen
    that can oversee large transmission pipeline projects. A
    shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel creates
    competitive hiring markets and may result in increased labor
    expenses. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair
    our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues.

Backlog
    may not be realized or may not result in profits.

Backlog is difficult to determine with certainty. Customers
    often have no obligation under our contracts to assign or
    release work to us, and many contracts may be terminated on
    short notice. Reductions in backlog due to cancellation of one
    or more contracts by a customer or for other reasons could
    significantly reduce the revenue and profit we actually receive
    from contracts included in backlog. In the event of a project
    cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but would
    not have a contractual right to the total revenues reflected in
    our backlog. The backlog we obtain in connection with any
    companies we acquire may not be as large as we believed or may
    not result in the revenue or profits we expected. In addition,
    projects that are delayed may remain in backlog for extended
    periods of time. All of these uncertainties are heightened as a
    result of negative economic conditions and their impact on our
    customers’ spending, as well as the effects of regulatory
    requirements and weather conditions. Consequently, we cannot
    assure that our estimates of backlog are accurate or that we
    will be able to realize our estimated backlog.

Our
    financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that
    may differ from actual results.

In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States, several estimates and assumptions are used by management
    in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented
    and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to
    exist as of the date of the financial statements. These
    estimates and assumptions must be made because certain
    information that is used in the preparation of our financial
    statements is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated
    with a high degree of precision from data available or is not
    capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted
    methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly
    difficult to determine and we must exercise significant
    judgment. Estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful
    lives of assets, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill,
    other intangibles and long-lived asset impairments, valuation of
    derivative contracts, purchase price allocations, liabilities
    for self-insured claims, revenue recognition for construction
    contracts and fiber optic licensing, share-based compensation,
    operating results of reportable segments, provision for income
    taxes and the calculation of uncertain tax positions. Actual
    results for all estimates could differ materially from the
    estimates and assumptions that we use, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.


Our
    inability to successfully execute our acquisition strategy may
    have an adverse impact on our growth strategy.

Our business strategy includes expanding our presence in the
    industries we serve through strategic acquisitions of companies
    that complement or enhance our business. The number of
    acquisition targets that meet our criteria may be limited, and
    we may also face competition for acquisition opportunities. Some
    of our competitors may offer more favorable terms than us or
    have greater financial resources than we do. This competition
    may further limit our acquisition opportunities and our ability
    to grow through acquisitions or could raise the prices of
    acquisitions and make them less accretive or possibly not
    accretive to us. Acquisitions that we may pursue may also
    involve significant cash expenditures, the incurrence or
    assumption of debt or burdensome regulatory requirements. Any
    acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our
    business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows. Any of these factors could inhibit our ability to
    consummate future acquisitions, which could negatively affect
    our growth strategies.

We may
    be unsuccessful at integrating businesses that either we have
    acquired or that we may acquire in the future, which may reduce
    the anticipated benefit from acquired businesses.

As a part of our business strategy, we have acquired, and may
    seek to acquire in the future, companies that complement or
    enhance our business. The success of this strategy will depend
    on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the
    acquired businesses, such as the expansion of our existing
    operations, elimination of redundant costs and capitalizing on
    cross-selling opportunities. To realize these benefits, however,
    we must successfully integrate the operations of the acquired
    businesses with our existing operations. We cannot be sure that
    we will be able to successfully integrate acquired companies
    with our existing operations without substantial costs, delays,
    disruptions or other operational or financial problems.
    Additionally, if we do not implement proper overall business
    controls, our decentralized operating strategy could result in
    inconsistent operating and financial practices at the companies
    we acquire. Issues related to the integration process may result
    in adverse impact to our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
    Integrating our acquired companies involves a number of special
    risks that could have a negative impact on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations, including:

•

failure of acquired companies to achieve the results we expect;

•

diversion of our management’s attention from operational
    and other matters;

•

difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of
    acquired companies;

•

inability to retain key personnel of acquired companies;

•

risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities;

•

loss of business due to customer overlap or change from local or
    private ownership;

•

risks arising from the prior operations of acquired companies,
    such as performance, operational, safety or workforce issues, or
    customer dissatisfaction; and

•

potential disruptions of our business.

Our
    results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of
    goodwill impairments.

When we acquire a business, we record an asset called
    “goodwill” equal to the excess amount we pay for the
    business, including liabilities assumed, over the fair value of
    the tangible and intangible assets of the business we acquire.
    Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful
    lives cannot be amortized, but instead must be tested at least
    annually for impairment, while intangible assets that have
    finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives. The
    accounting literature provides specific guidance for testing
    goodwill and other

non-amortized

intangible assets for impairment. Refer to Item 7.

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Critical
    Accounting Polices”

for a detailed discussion.
    Management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions
    when allocating goodwill to reporting units and determining the
    fair value of a reporting unit’s net assets and
    liabilities, including, among other things, an assessment of
    market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, cost
    of capital and growth rates, which could significantly impact
    the


reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair
    value is determined using a combination of the discounted cash
    flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation
    approaches. Absent any impairment indicators, we perform our
    impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter. If there is
    a decrease in market capitalization below book value in the
    future, this may be considered an impairment indicator. Any
    future impairments, including impairments of the goodwill or
    intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisitions
    of Valard and Price Gregory, and other past or future
    acquisitions, would negatively impact our results of operations
    for the period in which the impairment is recognized.

Our
    profitability and financial operations may be negatively
    affected by changes in, or interpretations of, existing state or
    federal telecommunications regulations or new regulations that
    could adversely affect our Fiber Optic Licensing
    segment.

Many of our Fiber Optic Licensing segment customers benefit from
    the Universal Service

“E-rate”

program, which was established by Congress in the 1996
    Telecommunications Act and is administered by the Universal
    Service Administrative Company (USAC) under the oversight of the
    Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Under the

E-rate

program, schools, libraries and certain healthcare facilities
    may receive subsidies for certain approved telecommunications
    services, internet access and internal connections. From time to
    time, bills have been introduced in Congress that would
    eliminate or curtail the

E-rate

program. Passage of such actions by the FCC or USAC to further
    limit

E-rate

subsidies could decrease the demand by certain customers for the
    services offered by our Fiber Optic Licensing segment.

The telecommunications services we provide through our Fiber
    Optic Licensing segment are subject to regulation by the FCC, to
    the extent that they are interstate telecommunications services,
    and by state regulatory agencies, when wholly within a
    particular state. To remain eligible to provide services under
    the

E-rate

program, we must maintain telecommunications authorizations in
    every state where we operate, and we must obtain such
    authorizations in any new state where we plan to operate.
    Changes in federal or state regulations could reduce the
    profitability of our Fiber Optic Licensing segment, and delays
    in obtaining new authorizations could inhibit our ability to
    grow our Fiber Optic Licensing segment in new geographic areas.
    We could be subject to fines if the FCC or a state regulatory
    agency were to determine that any of our activities or positions
    are not in compliance with certain regulations. If the
    profitability of our Fiber Optic Licensing segment were to
    decline, or if the business of this segment were to become
    subject to fines, our overall results of operations and cash
    flows could also be adversely affected.

The
    business of our Fiber Optic Licensing segment is capital
    intensive and requires substantial investments, and returns on
    investments may be less than expected for various
    reasons.

The business of our Fiber Optic Licensing segment requires
    substantial amounts of capital investment to build out new fiber
    networks. In 2011, our proposed capital expenditures for our
    fiber optic licensing business is approximately $30 million
    to $35 million, $15.1 million of which is related to
    committed licensing arrangements as of December 31, 2010.
    Although we generally do not commit capital to new networks
    until we have a committed license arrangement in place with at
    least one customer, we may not be able to recoup our initial
    investment in the network if that customer defaults on its
    commitment. Even if the customer does not default or we add
    additional customers to the network, we still may not realize a
    return on the capital investment for an extended period of time.
    Furthermore, the amount of capital that we invest in our fiber
    optic network may exceed planned expenditures as a result of
    various factors, including difficulty in obtaining permits or
    rights of way or unexpected increases in costs due to labor,
    materials or project productivity, which would result in a
    decrease in the returns on our capital investments if licensing
    fees for the network were committed and could not be
    renegotiated. New or developing technologies or significant
    competition in any of our markets could also negatively impact
    the business of our Fiber Optic Licensing segment. If any of the
    above events occur, it could adversely affect our results of
    operations or result in an impairment of our fiber optic network.

We
    extend credit to customers for purchases of our services and may
    enter into longer-term deferred payment arrangements or provide
    other financing or investment arrangements with certain of our
    customers, which


subjects us to potential credit or investment risk that
    could, if realized, adversely affect our results of operations
    or financial condition.

We grant credit, generally without collateral, to our customers,
    which include electric power utilities, oil and gas companies,
    telecommunications service providers, governmental entities,
    general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of
    renewal energy facilities and commercial and industrial
    properties located primarily in the United States and Canada. We
    may also agree to allow our customers to defer payment on
    projects until certain milestones have been met or until the
    projects are substantially completed, and customers typically
    withhold some portion of amounts due to us as retainage. In
    addition, we may provide other forms of financing to our
    customers or make investments in our customers’ projects,
    typically in situations where we also provide services in
    connection with the projects. Our payment arrangements with our
    customers subject us to potential credit risk related to changes
    in business and economic factors affecting our customers,
    including material changes in our customers’ revenues or
    cash flows. These changes may also reduce the value of any
    financing or equity investment arrangements we have with our
    customers. Many of our customers have been negatively impacted
    by the recent economic downturn, and some may experience
    financial difficulties (including bankruptcies) that could
    impact our ability to collect amounts owed to us or impair the
    value of our investments in them. If we are unable to collect
    amounts owed to us, our cash flows would be reduced and we could
    experience losses if the uncollectible amounts exceeded current
    allowances. We would also recognize losses with respect to any
    investments that are impaired as a result of our customers’
    financial difficulties. Losses experienced could materially and
    adversely affect our financial condition and results of
    operation. The risks of collectability and impairment losses may
    increase for projects where we provide services as well as make
    a financing or equity investment.

The
    loss of key personnel could disrupt our business.

We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and
    on senior management of our operating units, including the
    businesses we acquire. Although we have entered into employment
    agreements with terms of one to three years with most of our
    executive officers and certain other key employees, we cannot be
    certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for
    any particular period of time. The loss of key personnel, or the
    inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could
    negatively impact our ability to manage our business. We do not
    carry key-person life insurance on any of our employees.

Our
    unionized workforce and related obligations could adversely
    affect our operations.

As of December 31, 2010, approximately 39% of our hourly
    employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements.
    Although the majority of the collective bargaining agreements
    prohibit strikes and work stoppages, we cannot be certain that
    strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future. Strikes
    or work stoppages would adversely impact our relationships with
    our customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease
    our revenue. Additionally, our collective bargaining agreements
    generally require us to participate with other companies in
    multi-employer pension plans. To the extent those plans are
    underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
    1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments
    Act of 1980, may subject us to substantial liabilities under
    those plans if we withdraw from them or they are terminated. In
    addition, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding
    rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007
    for multi-employer plans that are classified as
    “endangered,” “seriously endangered,” or
    “critical” status. For a plan in “critical”
    status, additional required contributions and benefit reductions
    may apply if a plan is determined to be underfunded, which could
    detrimentally affect our financial condition or results of
    operations. A number of multi-employer plans to which we
    contribute or may contribute in the future are in
    “critical” status, “seriously endangered”
    status or “endangered” status. With respect to certain
    of the plans in critical status, we may be required to make
    additional contributions, generally in the form of surcharges on
    contributions otherwise required. Should we provide in the
    future a significant amount of services in areas that require us
    to utilize unionized employees covered by these affected plans,
    causing us to make substantial contributions, or should a
    determination be made that additional plans to which any of our
    operating units contribute are in a “critical” status
    requiring additional contributions, it could detrimentally
    affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash
    flows if we are not able to adequately mitigate these costs.


Our ability to complete future acquisitions could be adversely
    affected because of our union status for a variety of reasons.
    For instance, our union agreements may be incompatible with the
    union agreements of a business we want to acquire and some
    businesses may not want to become affiliated with a union-based
    company. Additionally, we may increase our exposure to
    withdrawal liabilities for underfunded multi-employer pension
    plans to which an acquired company contributes.

Approximately 61% of our hourly employees are not unionized. The
    current presidential administration has expressed strong support
    for proposed legislation that would create more flexibility and
    opportunity for labor unions to organize non-union workers. If
    passed, this legislation could result in a greater percentage of
    our workforce being subject to collective bargaining agreements,
    heightening the risks described above. In addition, certain of
    our customers require or prefer a non-union workforce, and they
    may reduce the amount of work assigned to us if our non-union
    labor crews were to become unionized, which could negatively
    affect our business and results of operations.

We may
    incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational
    impacts relating to occupational health and safety
    matters.

Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations
    relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace.
    While we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial
    resources in our occupational health and safety programs, our
    industry involves a high degree of operational risk and there
    can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability
    exposure. Although we have taken what we believe are appropriate
    precautions, we have suffered fatalities in the past and may
    suffer additional fatalities in the future. Serious accidents,
    including fatalities, may subject us to substantial penalties,
    civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Claims for damages to
    persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life,
    could result in substantial costs and liabilities, which could
    materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results
    of operations or cash flows. In addition, if our safety record
    were to substantially deteriorate over time or we were to suffer
    substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of
    health and safety regulations, our customers could cancel our
    contracts and not award us future business.

Risks
    associated with operating in international markets could
    restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business
    and prospects, and we could be adversely affected by our failure
    to comply with the laws applicable to our foreign activities,
    including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other
    similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.

Our international operations are presently conducted primarily
    in Canada, but we have performed work in South Africa, Mexico
    and various other foreign countries, and we expect that the
    number of countries in which we operate could expand
    significantly over the next few years. Economic conditions,
    including those resulting from wars, civil unrest, acts of
    terrorism and other conflicts or volatility in the global
    markets, may adversely affect our customers, their demand for
    our services and their ability to pay for our services. In
    addition, there are numerous risks inherent in conducting our
    business internationally, including, but not limited to,
    potential instability in international markets, changes in
    regulatory requirements applicable to international operations,
    currency fluctuations in foreign countries, political, economic
    and social conditions in foreign countries and complex
    U.S. and foreign laws and treaties, including tax laws and
    the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These risks
    could restrict our ability to provide services to international
    customers or to operate our international business profitably,
    and our overall business and results of operations could be
    negatively impacted by our foreign activities.

The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions
    prohibit

U.S.-based

companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments
    to

non-U.S. officials

for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We pursue
    opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience
    government corruption, and in certain circumstances, compliance
    with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and
    practices. Our policies mandate compliance with all applicable
    anti-bribery laws. Further, we require our partners,
    subcontractors, agents and others who work for us or on our
    behalf to comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws.
    Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that
    we, our employees, our agents and others who work with us in
    foreign countries comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery
    laws, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures
    will protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws
    for actions taken by our agents, employees


and intermediaries. If we are found to be liable for FCPA
    violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or
    due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from
    severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which
    could have a material adverse effect on our reputation,
    business, results of operations or cash flows. In addition,
    detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged FCPA
    violations is expensive and could consume significant time and
    attention of our senior management.

We may
    not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance
    desired growth and operations.

If we cannot secure funds in the future, including financing on
    acceptable terms, we may be unable to support our growth
    strategy or future operations. We cannot readily predict the
    ability of certain customers to pay for past services, and
    unfavorable economic conditions, such as those experienced over
    the past two years, may negatively impact the ability of our
    customers to pay amounts owed to us. We may also use cash for
    acquisitions, as well as for investments in projects in which we
    provide services, both of which are elements of our growth
    strategy, but we cannot readily predict the timing, size and
    success of our acquisition or investment efforts. Using cash for
    acquisitions and investments limits our financial flexibility
    and makes us more likely to seek additional capital through
    future debt or equity financings. Our existing credit facility
    contains significant restrictions on our operational and
    financial flexibility, including our ability to incur additional
    debt or conduct equity financings, and if we seek more debt we
    may have to agree to additional covenants that limit our
    operational and financial flexibility. If we seek additional
    debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that additional
    debt or equity will be available to us on terms acceptable to us
    or at all, in particular taking into account recent constraints
    in the financial markets. Furthermore, our credit facility is
    based upon existing commitments from several banks. Banks have
    become more restrictive in their lending practices following the
    difficulties in the credit markets, and some may be unable or
    unwilling to fund their commitments, which may limit our access
    to the capital needed to fund our growth and operations. Our
    existing credit facility will expire in September 2012, and we
    may not be able to obtain commitments from banks to replace or
    renew our existing credit facility in an equivalent amount or at
    all. Additionally, any new credit facility that replaces or
    renews the existing facility may be on terms that are more
    restrictive or costly. In the event that our credit facility is
    not replaced or renewed prior to October 2011, we may also be
    required to provide cash as collateral for any existing or new
    letters of credit that have maturity dates beyond the expiration
    date of our existing credit facility. In addition, we rely on
    financing companies to fund the leasing of certain of our trucks
    and trailers, support vehicles and specialty construction
    equipment. Credit market conditions may cause certain of these
    financing companies to restrict or withhold access to capital to
    fund the leasing of additional equipment. Although we are not
    dependent on any single equipment lessor, a widespread lack of
    available capital to fund the leasing of equipment could
    negatively impact our future operations. Additionally, the
    market price of our common stock may change significantly in
    response to various factors and events beyond our control, which
    will impact our ability to use equity to obtain funds. A variety
    of events may cause the market price of our common stock to
    fluctuate significantly, including overall market conditions or
    volatility, a shortfall in our operating results from those
    anticipated, negative results or other unfavorable information
    relating to our market peers or the risks described in this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Our
    participation in joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or
    harm to our reputation for failures of our
    partners.

As part of our business, we have entered into joint venture
    arrangements and may enter into additional joint venture
    arrangements in the future. The purpose of these joint ventures
    is typically to combine skills and resources to allow for the
    performance of particular projects. Success on these jointly
    performed projects depends in large part on whether our joint
    venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations. We and
    our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally
    liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint
    ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is
    financially unable to bear its portion of required capital
    contributions or other obligations, including liabilities
    stemming from claims or lawsuits, we could be required to make
    additional investments, provide additional services or pay more
    than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our
    partner’s shortfall. Further, if we are unable to
    adequately address our partner’s performance issues, the
    customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal
    liability to us, harm our reputation and reduce our profit on a
    project.


We are
    in the process of implementing an information technology
    (“IT”) solution, which could temporarily disrupt

day-to-day

operations at certain operating units.

We continue to implement a comprehensive IT solution that we
    believe will allow for the interface between functions such as
    accounting and finance, human resources, operations, and fleet
    management. Continued development and implementation of the IT
    solution will require substantial financial and personnel
    resources. While the IT solution is intended to improve and
    enhance our information systems, implementation of new
    information systems at each operating unit exposes us to the
    risks of

start-up

of
    the new system and integration of that system with our existing
    systems and processes, including possible disruption of our
    financial reporting. Failure to properly implement the IT
    solution could result in substantial disruptions to our
    business, including coordinating and processing our normal
    business activities, testing and recording of certain data
    necessary to provide oversight over our disclosure controls and
    procedures and effective internal controls over our financial
    reporting, and other unforeseen problems.

Our
    dependence on suppliers, subcontractors and equipment
    manufacturers could expose us to the risk of loss in our
    operations.

On certain projects, we rely on suppliers to obtain the
    necessary materials and subcontractors to perform portions of
    our services. We also rely on equipment manufacturers to provide
    us with the equipment required to conduct our operations.
    Although we are not dependent on any single supplier,
    subcontractor or equipment manufacturer, any substantial
    limitation on the availability of required suppliers,
    subcontractors or equipment manufacturers could negatively
    impact our operations. The risk of a lack of available
    suppliers, subcontractors or equipment manufacturers may be
    heightened as a result of recent market and economic conditions.
    To the extent we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire
    equipment or materials, we could experience losses in the
    performance of our operations.

Fluctuating
    foreign currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our
    financial results as we expand into international
    markets.

While only a small percentage of our revenue is currently
    derived from international markets, we intend to continue to
    expand the volume of services that we provide internationally.
    As a result, our reported financial condition and results of
    operations may be more significantly exposed to the effects
    (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates
    have on the process of translating the financial statements of
    our international operations, which are denominated in local
    currencies, into the U.S. dollar.

Our
    business growth could outpace the capability of our corporate
    management infrastructure.

We cannot be certain that our infrastructure will be adequate to
    support our operations as they expand. Future growth also could
    impose significant additional responsibilities on members of our
    senior management, including the need to recruit and integrate
    new senior level managers and executives. We cannot be certain
    that we will be able to recruit and retain such additional
    managers and executives. To the extent that we are unable to
    manage our growth effectively, or are unable to attract and
    retain additional qualified management, we may not be able to
    expand our operations or execute our business plan.

A
    portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety
    bonds. We may be unable to compete for or work on certain
    projects if we are not able to obtain the necessary surety
    bonds.

Current or future market conditions, including losses incurred
    in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate
    bankruptcies, as well as changes in our sureties’
    assessment of our operating and financial risk, could cause our
    surety providers to decline to issue or renew, or substantially
    reduce the amount of, bid

and/or

performance bonds for our work and could increase our bonding
    costs. These actions could be taken on short notice. If our
    surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to
    bonding, our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity
    from other sureties, finding more business that does not require
    bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project
    performance, such as letters of credit or cash. We may be unable
    to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable
    terms, or at all, which could affect our ability to bid for or
    work on future projects requiring financial assurances.


We have also granted security interests in various of our assets
    to collateralize our obligations to our sureties. Furthermore,
    under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or
    continue bonds on a

project-by-project

basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the
    posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or
    renewing any bonds. If we were to experience an interruption or
    reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of
    these or any other reasons, we may be unable to compete for or
    work on certain projects that would require bonding.

Our
    failure to comply with environmental laws could result in
    significant liabilities.

Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and
    regulations, including those dealing with the handling and
    disposal of waste products, PCBs, fuel storage and air quality.
    We perform work in many different types of underground
    environments. If the field location maps supplied to us are not
    accurate, or if objects are present in the soil that are not
    indicated on the field location maps, our underground work could
    strike objects in the soil, some of which may contain
    pollutants. These objects may also rupture, resulting in the
    discharge of pollutants. In such circumstances, we may be liable
    for fines and damages, and we may be unable to obtain
    reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect
    information. We perform work in and around environmentally
    sensitive areas such as rivers, lakes and wetlands. In addition,
    we perform directional drilling operations below certain
    environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies. Due to the
    inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies, it is
    possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface
    fracture, resulting in the release of subsurface materials.
    These subsurface materials may contain contaminants in excess of
    amounts permitted by law, potentially exposing us to remediation
    costs and fines. We also own and lease several facilities at
    which we store our equipment. Some of these facilities contain
    fuel storage tanks that are above or below ground. If these
    tanks were to leak, we could be responsible for the cost of
    remediation as well as potential fines.

In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of
    existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously
    unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new

clean-up

requirements could require us to incur significant costs or
    become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could
    negatively impact our financial condition and results of
    operations. In certain instances, we have obtained
    indemnification or covenants from third parties (including
    predecessors or lessors) for such clean-up and other obligations
    and liabilities that we believe are adequate to cover such
    obligations and liabilities. However, such third-party
    indemnities or covenants may not cover all of our costs, and
    such unanticipated obligations or liabilities, or future
    obligations and liabilities, may have a material adverse effect
    on our business operations, financial condition or cash flows.
    Further, we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify
    or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities
    relating to any acquired business.

There are also other legislative and regulatory proposals to
    address greenhouse gas emissions. These proposals, if enacted,
    could result in a variety of regulatory programs including
    potential new regulations, additional charges to fund energy
    efficiency activities, or other regulatory actions. Any of these
    actions could result in increased costs associated with our
    operations and impact the prices we charge our customers. For
    example, if new regulations are adopted regulating greenhouse
    gas emissions from mobile sources such as cars and trucks, we
    could experience a significant increase in environmental
    compliance costs in light of our large rolling-stock fleet. In
    addition, if our operations are perceived to result in high
    greenhouse gas emissions, our reputation could suffer.

Opportunities
    within the government arena could subject us to increased
    governmental regulation and costs.

Most government contracts are awarded through a regulated
    competitive bidding process. As we pursue increased
    opportunities in the government arena, management’s focus
    associated with the start-up and bidding process may be diverted
    away from other opportunities. Involvement with government
    contracts could require a significant amount of costs to be
    incurred before any revenues are realized from these contracts.
    In addition, as a government contractor, we are subject to a
    number of procurement rules and other public sector liabilities,
    any deemed violation of which could lead to fines or penalties
    or a loss of business. Government agencies routinely audit and
    investigate government contractors. Government agencies may
    review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, cost
    structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and
    standards. If government agencies determine through these audits
    or reviews that costs were improperly allocated to specific
    contracts, they will not reimburse the contractor for those
    costs or may require the contractor to refund previously
    reimbursed costs. If


government agencies determine that we engaged in improper
    activity, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties. In
    addition, if the government were to even allege improper
    activity, we also could experience serious harm to our
    reputation. Many government contracts must be appropriated each
    year. If appropriations are not made in subsequent years we
    would not realize all of the potential revenues from any awarded
    contracts.

We may
    not be successful in continuing to meet the requirements of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has many requirements applicable
    to us regarding corporate governance and financial reporting,
    including the requirements for management to report on our
    internal controls over financial reporting and for our
    independent registered public accounting firm to express an
    opinion over the operating effectiveness of our internal control
    over financial reporting. During 2010, we continued actions to
    ensure our ability to comply with these requirements. As of
    December 31, 2010, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective; however, there can be no assurance that
    our internal control over financial reporting will be effective
    in future years. Failure to maintain effective internal controls
    or the identification of significant internal control
    deficiencies in acquisitions already made or made in the future
    could result in a decrease in the market value of our common
    stock and our other publicly traded securities, the reduced
    ability to obtain financing, the loss of customers, penalties
    and additional expenditures to meet the requirements.

If we
    are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights or if our
    intellectual property rights become obsolete, our competitive
    position could be adversely impacted.

We utilize a variety of intellectual property rights in our
    services. We view our portfolio of proprietary energized
    services tools and techniques as well as our other process and
    design technologies as one of our competitive strengths, and we
    use it as part of our efforts to differentiate our service
    offerings. We may not be able to successfully preserve these
    intellectual property rights in the future and these rights
    could be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition,
    the laws of some foreign countries in which our services may be
    sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same
    extent as the laws of the United States. We also license certain
    technologies from third parties, and there is a risk that our
    relationships with licensors may terminate or expire or may be
    interrupted or harmed. If we are unable to protect and maintain
    our intellectual property rights, or if there are any successful
    intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings
    against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings
    could be reduced. In addition, if our intellectual property
    rights or work processes become obsolete, we may not be able to
    differentiate our service offerings, and some of our competitors
    may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers.
    As a result, our business and revenue could be materially and
    adversely affected.

We may
    incur additional healthcare costs arising from federal
    healthcare reform legislation.

In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
    and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010
    were signed into law in the U.S. This legislation expands
    health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands
    coverage to those already insured. The changes required by this
    legislation could cause us to incur additional healthcare and
    other costs, although we do not expect any material short-term
    impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation.
    We are currently assessing the extent of any long-term impact
    from the legislation, including any potential changes to this
    legislation.

Certain
    provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an
    acquisition of our company more difficult.

The following provisions of our certificate of incorporation and
    bylaws, as currently in effect, as well as Delaware law, could
    discourage potential proposals to acquire us, delay or prevent a
    change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be
    willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock:

•

our certificate of incorporation permits our Board of Directors
    to issue “blank check” preferred stock and to adopt
    amendments to our bylaws;

•

our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of
    stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be
    considered at stockholder meetings;


•

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right
    of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to
    act by written consent; and

•

we are subject to provisions of Delaware law which prohibit us
    from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions
    with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three
    years following the date such stockholder became classified as
    an interested stockholder.

Properties

Facilities

We lease our corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas and
    maintain other facilities throughout North America. Our
    facilities are used for offices, equipment yards, warehouses,
    storage and vehicle shops. As of December 31, 2010, we
    own 37 of the facilities we occupy, many of which are
    encumbered by our credit facility, and we lease the remainder.
    We believe that our existing facilities are sufficient for our
    current needs.

Equipment

We operate a fleet of owned and leased trucks and trailers,
    support vehicles and specialty construction equipment, such as
    backhoes, excavators, trenchers, generators, boring machines,
    cranes, robotic arms, wire pullers, tensioners, and helicopters.
    Our owned equipment and the leasehold interest in our leased
    equipment is incumbered by a security interest under our credit
    facility. As of December 31, 2010, the total size of the
    rolling-stock fleet was approximately 24,000 units. Most of our
    fleet is serviced by our own mechanics who work at various
    maintenance sites and facilities. We believe that our equipment
    is generally well maintained and adequate for our present
    operations.

ITEM 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and
    other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These actions typically seek, among other things,
    compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract

and/or

property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
    losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all
    such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record a reserve when
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we disclose
    matters for which management believes a material loss is at
    least reasonably possible. See Note 14 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

    shares issued by Quanta Services EC Canada Ltd., a wholly owned
    subsidiary of Quanta, six holders of record of our Limited
    Vote Common Stock and one holder of record of our Series F
    preferred stock. There is no established trading market for the
    exchangeable shares, the Limited Vote Common Stock or the Series
    F preferred stock; however, the exchangeable shares may be
    exchanged at the option of the holder for Quanta common stock on
    a one-for-one basis and the Limited Vote Common Stock converts
    into common stock immediately upon sale. See Note 10 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Unregistered
    Sales of Securities During the Fourth Quarter of 2010

On October 25, 2010, we completed the acquisition of Valard
    in which some of the consideration consisted of our unregistered
    securities. The aggregate consideration paid in this transaction
    was $118.9 million in cash, 623,720 shares of Quanta
    common stock and 3,909,110 exchangeable shares of a Canadian
    subsidiary of Quanta that are substantially equivalent to, and
    exchangeable on a

one-for-one

basis for, Quanta common stock. In addition, one share of Quanta
    Series F preferred stock with voting rights equivalent to
    Quanta common stock equal to the number of exchangeable shares
    outstanding at any time was issued to a voting trust on behalf
    of the holders of the exchangeable shares. This acquisition was
    not affiliated with any other acquisitions prior to such
    transaction.

We relied on Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as
    amended (the Securities Act), as the basis for exemption from
    registration. Regulation S allows the issuance of
    securities to persons outside the United States without
    registration. All issuances were as a result of privately
    negotiated transactions and not pursuant to public solicitations.

In connection with acquisition of Valard, certain former owners
    of Valard received exchangeable shares of Quanta Services EC
    Canada Ltd. (EC Canada), one of Quanta’s wholly owned
    Canadian subsidiaries that was subsequently amalgamated with
    Valard Construction Ltd. The exchangeable shares may be
    exchanged at the


option of the holder for Quanta common stock on a

one-for-one

basis. The holders of exchangeable shares can make an exchange
    only once in any calendar quarter and must exchange a minimum of
    either 50,000 shares or, if less, the total number of
    remaining exchangeable shares registered in the name of the
    holder making the request.

(ii)

In connection with the acquisition of Valard on October 25,
    2010, Quanta issued one share of Quanta Series F preferred
    stock to a voting trust on behalf of the holders of the
    exchangeable shares of EC Canada discussed above. The
    Series F preferred stock provides the holders of the
    exchangeable shares voting rights in Quanta common stock
    equivalent to the number of exchangeable shares outstanding at
    any time.

Dividends

We have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock
    during the years ended December 31, 2010 or 2009. We
    currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to
    finance the growth, development and expansion of our business.
    Accordingly, we currently do not intend to declare or pay any
    cash dividends on our common stock in the immediate future. The
    declaration, payment and amount of future cash dividends, if
    any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after
    taking into account various factors. These factors include our
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flows from
    operations, current and anticipated capital requirements and
    expansion plans, the income tax laws then in effect and the
    requirements of Delaware law. In addition, as discussed in

“Debt Instruments — Credit Facility”

in Item 7.

“Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”

our credit facility includes limitations on the payment of
    cash dividends without the consent of the lenders.

Performance
    Graph

The following Performance Graph and related information shall
    not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be
    “filed” with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
    nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any
    future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that
    we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.

The following graph compares, for the period from
    December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2010, the cumulative
    stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total
    return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (the
    S&P 500 Index) and two peer groups selected by our
    management that include public companies within our industry.
    The companies in each peer group were selected because they
    comprise a broad group of publicly held corporations, each of
    which has some operations similar to ours. The peer group used
    in prior years (the 2009 Peer Group) includes Chicago
    Bridge & Iron Company N.V., Dycom Industries, Inc.,
    MasTec, Inc., MYR Group Inc., Pike Electric Corporation, and The
    Shaw Group, Inc. The current peer group (the 2010 Peer Group)
    includes Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., Comfort
    Systems USA Inc., Dycom Industries, Inc., EMCOR Group Inc.,
    Flour Corporation, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., MasTec, Inc.,
    MYR Group Inc., Pike Electric Corporation, The Shaw Group, Inc.,
    URS Corp. and Wilbros Group Inc. The shift to the 2010 Peer
    Group was based on our decision to focus the comparison on
    companies that are similar to us in market capitalization and
    lines of business and for consistency with other comparisons, as
    management and the Board utilize the 2010 Peer Group when
    evaluating various aspects of our business.


The graph below assumes an investment of $100 (with reinvestment
    of all dividends) in our common stock, the S&P 500 Index,
    and each of the peer groups, on December 31, 2005 and
    tracks their relative performance through December 31,
    2010. MYR Group Inc. completed its initial public offering on
    August 12, 2008, and accordingly, the performance graph
    below assumes $100 was invested in MYR Group Inc. in 2008. The
    graph also assumes that the returns of each company in the peer
    groups are weighted based on the market capitalization of each
    constituent company at the beginning of the measurement period.
    The stock price performance reflected on the following graph is
    not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations should be read in
    conjunction with our historical consolidated financial
    statements and related notes thereto in Item 8.
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The
    discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are
    based upon our current expectations and are subject to
    uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may
    differ materially from these expectations due to inaccurate
    assumptions and known or unknown risks and uncertainties,
    including those identified in “Uncertainty of
    Forward-Looking Statements and Information” below and in
    Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

Introduction

We are a leading national provider of specialty contracting
    services, offering infrastructure solutions to the electric
    power, natural gas and oil pipeline and telecommunications
    industries. The services we provide include the design,
    installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of infrastructure
    within each of the industries we serve, such as electric power
    transmission and distribution networks, substation facilities,
    renewable energy facilities, natural gas and oil transmission
    and distribution systems and telecommunications networks used
    for video, data and voice transmission. We also design, procure,
    construct and maintain fiber optic telecommunications
    infrastructure in select markets and license the right to use
    these

point-to-point

fiber optic telecommunications facilities to customers.

We report our results under four reportable segments:
    (1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services,
    (2) Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services,
    (3) Telecommunications Infrastructure Services and
    (4) Fiber Optic Licensing. These reportable segments are
    based on the types of services we provide. Our consolidated
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were
    approximately $3.9 billion, of which 52% was attributable
    to the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment, 36% to
    the Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment, 9%
    to the Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segment and 3%
    to the Fiber Optic Licensing segment.

Our customers include many of the leading companies in the
    industries we serve. We have developed strong strategic
    alliances with numerous customers and strive to develop and
    maintain our status as a preferred vendor to our customers. We
    enter into various types of contracts, including competitive
    unit price, hourly rate, cost-plus (or time and materials
    basis), and fixed price (or lump sum basis), the final terms and
    prices of which we frequently negotiate with the customer.
    Although the terms of our contracts vary considerably, most are
    made on either a unit price or fixed price basis in which we
    agree to do the work for a price per unit of work performed
    (unit price) or for a fixed amount for the entire project (fixed
    price). We complete a substantial majority of our fixed price
    projects within one year, while we frequently provide
    maintenance and repair work under open-ended unit price or
    cost-plus master service agreements that are renewable
    periodically.

We recognize revenue on our unit price and cost-plus contracts
    as units are completed or services are performed. For our fixed
    price contracts, we record revenues as work on the contract
    progresses on a

percentage-of-completion

basis. Under this method, revenue is recognized based on the
    percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to
    total estimated costs to complete the contract. Fixed price
    contracts generally include retainage provisions under which a
    percentage of the contract price is withheld until the project
    is complete and has been accepted by our customer.

For internal management purposes, we are organized into three
    internal divisions, namely, the electric power division, the
    natural gas and pipeline division and the telecommunications
    division. These internal divisions are closely aligned with the
    reportable segments described above based on the predominant
    type of work provided by the operating units within a division.
    The operating units providing predominantly telecommunications
    and fiber optic licensing services are managed within the same
    internal division.

Reportable segment information, including revenues and operating
    income by type of work, is gathered from each operating unit for
    the purpose of evaluating segment performance in support of our
    market strategies. These classifications of our operating unit
    revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes can at
    times require judgment on the part of management. Our operating
    units may perform joint infrastructure service projects for
    customers in multiple industries, deliver multiple types of
    network services under a single customer contract or


provide service across industries, for example, joint trenching
    projects to install distribution lines for electric power,
    natural gas and telecommunication customers. Our integrated
    operations and common administrative support at each of our
    operating units requires that certain allocations, including
    allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility
    costs, indirect operating expenses including depreciation and
    general and administrative costs, are made to determine
    operating segment profitability. Corporate costs, such as
    payroll and benefits, employee travel expenses, facility costs,
    professional fees, acquisition costs and amortization related to
    certain intangible costs are not allocated.

The Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment provides
    comprehensive network solutions to customers in the electric
    power industry. Services performed by the Electric Power
    Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design,
    installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power
    transmission and distribution networks and substation facilities
    along with other engineering and technical services. This
    segment also provides emergency restoration services, including
    repairing infrastructure damaged by inclement weather, the
    energized installation, maintenance and upgrade of electric
    power infrastructure utilizing unique bare hand and hot stick
    methods and our proprietary robotic arm technologies, and the
    installation of “smart grid” technologies on electric
    power networks. In addition, this segment designs, installs and
    maintains renewable energy generation facilities, in particular
    solar and wind, and related switchyards and transmission
    networks. To a lesser extent, this segment provides services
    such as the design, installation, maintenance and repair of
    commercial and industrial wiring, installation of traffic
    networks and the installation of cable and control systems for
    light rail lines.

The Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment
    provides comprehensive network solutions to customers involved
    in the transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline
    products. Services performed by the Natural Gas and Pipeline
    Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design,
    installation, repair and maintenance of natural gas and oil
    transmission and distribution systems, compressor and pump
    stations and gas gathering systems, as well as related
    trenching, directional boring and automatic welding services. In
    addition, this segment’s services include pipeline
    protection, pipeline integrity and rehabilitation and
    fabrication of pipeline support systems and related structures
    and facilities. To a lesser extent, this segment designs,
    installs and maintains airport fueling systems as well as water
    and sewer infrastructure.

The Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segment provides
    comprehensive network solutions to customers in the
    telecommunications and cable television industries. Services
    performed by the Telecommunications Infrastructure Services
    segment generally include the design, installation, repair and
    maintenance of fiber optic, copper and coaxial cable networks
    used for video, data and voice transmission, as well as the
    design, installation and upgrade of wireless communications
    networks, including towers, switching systems and
    “backhaul” links from wireless systems to voice, data
    and video networks. This segment also provides emergency
    restoration services, including repairing telecommunications
    infrastructure damaged by inclement weather. To a lesser extent,
    services provided under this segment include cable locating,
    splicing and testing of fiber optic networks and residential
    installation of fiber optic cabling.

The Fiber Optic Licensing segment designs, procures, constructs
    and maintains fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure in
    select markets and licenses the right to use these

point-to-point

fiber optic telecommunications facilities to our customers
    pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with licensing terms
    from five to twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal
    options. Under those agreements, customers are provided the
    right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic
    facility, with the facility owned and maintained by us. The
    Fiber Optic Licensing segment provides services to enterprise,
    education, carrier, financial services and healthcare customers,
    as well as other entities with high bandwidth telecommunication
    needs. The telecommunication services provided through this
    segment are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications
    Commission and certain state public utility commissions.

Recent
    Acquisitions

On October 25, 2010, we acquired Valard Construction LP and
    certain of its affiliated entities (Valard), an electric power
    infrastructure services company based in Alberta, Canada. This
    acquisition allows us to further expand our electric power
    infrastructure capabilities and scope of services in Canada.
    Because of the type of work performed by Valard, its financial
    results will generally be included in the Electric Power
    Infrastructure Services


segment. The results of Valard have been included in our
    consolidated financial statements beginning on October 25,
    2010.

Seasonality;
    Fluctuations of Results; Economic Conditions

Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to
    seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced
    by weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, project
    timing and schedules as well as holidays. Typically, our
    revenues are lowest in the first quarter of the year because
    cold, snowy or wet conditions cause delays on projects. The
    second quarter is typically better than the first, as some
    projects begin, but continued cold and wet weather can often
    impact second quarter productivity. The third quarter is
    typically the best of the year, as a greater number of projects
    are underway and weather is more accommodating to work on
    projects. Generally, revenues during the fourth quarter of the
    year are lower than the third quarter but higher than the second
    quarter. Many projects are completed in the fourth quarter, and
    revenues are often impacted positively by customers seeking to
    spend their capital budgets before the end of the year; however,
    the holiday season and inclement weather can sometimes cause
    delays, reducing revenues and increasing costs. Any quarter may
    be positively or negatively affected by atypical weather
    patterns in a given part of the country such as severe weather,
    excessive rainfall or warmer winter weather, making it difficult
    to predict these variations

quarter-to-quarter

and their effect on particular projects.

Additionally, our industry can be highly cyclical. As a result,
    our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines or
    delays in new projects in various geographic regions in the
    United States and Canada. Project schedules, in particular in
    connection with larger, longer-term projects, can also create
    fluctuations in the services provided, which may adversely
    affect us in a given period. The financial condition of our
    customers and their access to capital, variations in the margins
    of projects performed during any particular period, regional,
    national and global economic and market conditions, timing of
    acquisitions, the timing and magnitude of acquisition and
    integration costs associated with acquisitions and interest rate
    fluctuations may also materially affect quarterly results.
    Accordingly, our operating results in any particular period may
    not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any
    other period. You should read

“Outlook”

and

“Understanding Margins”

for additional
    discussion of trends and challenges that may affect our
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We and our customers continue to operate in a challenging
    business environment, with increasing regulatory requirements
    and only gradual recovery in the economy and capital markets
    from recessionary levels. We are closely monitoring our
    customers and the effect that changes in economic and market
    conditions have had or may have on them. Certain of our
    customers have reduced spending in the past two years, which we
    attribute to the negative economic and market conditions, and we
    anticipate that these negative conditions may continue to affect
    demand for some of our services in the near-term. However, we
    believe that most of our customers, many of whom are regulated
    utilities, remain financially stable in general and will be able
    to continue with their business plans in the long-term. You
    should read “Outlook” and “Understanding
    Margins” for additional discussion of trends and challenges
    that may affect our financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flows.

Understanding
    Margins

Our gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of
    revenues, and our operating margin is operating income expressed
    as a percentage of revenues. Cost of services, which is
    subtracted from revenues to obtain gross profit, consists
    primarily of salaries, wages and benefits to employees,
    depreciation, fuel and other equipment expenses, equipment
    rentals, subcontracted services, insurance, facilities expenses,
    materials and parts and supplies. Selling, general and
    administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets
    are then subtracted from gross profit to obtain operating
    income. Various factors — some controllable, some
    not — impact our margins on a quarterly or annual
    basis.

Seasonal and Geographical.

As discussed above,
    seasonal patterns can have a significant impact on margins.
    Generally, business is slower in the winter months versus the
    warmer months of the year. This can be offset somewhat by
    increased demand for electrical service and repair work
    resulting from severe weather. Additionally, project schedules,
    including when projects begin and when they are completed, may
    impact margins. The mix of business conducted in different parts
    of the country will also affect margins, as some parts of the
    country offer the


opportunity for higher gross margins than others due to the
    geographic characteristics associated with the physical location
    where the work is being performed. Such characteristics include
    whether the project is performed in an urban versus a rural
    setting or in a mountainous area or in open terrain. Site
    conditions, including unforeseen underground conditions, can
    also impact margins.

Weather.

Adverse or favorable weather
    conditions can impact gross margins in a given period. For
    example, it is typical that parts of the country may experience
    snow or rainfall that may negatively impact our revenues and
    margins due to reduced productivity. In many cases, projects may
    be delayed or temporarily placed on hold. Conversely, in periods
    when weather remains dry and temperatures are accommodating,
    more work can be done, sometimes with less cost, which would
    have a favorable impact on margins. In some cases, severe
    weather, such as hurricanes and ice storms, can provide us with
    higher margin emergency restoration service work, which
    generally has a positive impact on margins.

Revenue Mix.

The mix of revenues derived from
    the industries we serve will impact margins, as certain
    industries provide higher margin opportunities. Additionally,
    changes in our customers’ spending patterns in each of the
    industries we serve can cause an imbalance in supply and demand
    and, therefore, affect margins and mix of revenues by industry
    served.

Service and Maintenance versus
    Installation.

Installation work is often obtained
    on a fixed price basis, while maintenance work is often
    performed under pre-established or negotiated prices or
    cost-plus pricing arrangements. Margins for installation work
    may vary from project to project, and may be higher than
    maintenance work, as work obtained on a fixed price basis has
    higher risk than other types of pricing arrangements. We
    typically derive approximately 30% of our annual revenues from
    maintenance work, but a higher portion of installation work in
    any given period may affect our gross margins for that period.

Subcontract Work.

Work that is subcontracted
    to other service providers generally yields lower margins. An
    increase in subcontract work in a given period may contribute to
    a decrease in margins. We typically subcontract approximately
    15% to 20% of our work to other service providers.

Materials versus Labor.

Typically, our
    customers are responsible for supplying their own materials on
    projects; however, for some of our contracts, we may agree to
    procure all or part of the required materials. Margins may be
    lower on projects where we furnish a significant amount of
    materials, as our

mark-up

on
    materials is generally lower than on our labor costs. In a given
    period, an increase in the percentage of work with higher
    materials procurement requirements may decrease our overall
    margins.

Depreciation.

We include depreciation in cost
    of services. This is common practice in our industry, but it can
    make comparability to other companies difficult. This must be
    taken into consideration when comparing us to other companies.

Insurance.

Margins could be impacted by
    fluctuations in insurance accruals as additional claims arise
    and as circumstances and conditions of existing claims change.
    We are insured for employer’s liability, general liability,
    auto liability and workers’ compensation claims. Since
    August 1, 2009, all policy deductible levels are
    $5.0 million per occurrence, other than employer’s
    liability, which is subject to a deductible of
    $1.0 million. We also have employee health care benefit
    plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining
    agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible
    of $350,000 per claimant per year. For the policy year ended
    July 31, 2009, employer’s liability claims were
    subject to a deductible of $1.0 million per occurrence,
    general liability and auto liability claims were subject to a
    deductible of $3.0 million per occurrence, and
    workers’ compensation claims were subject to a deductible
    of $2.0 million per occurrence. Additionally, for the
    policy year ended July 31, 2009, our workers’
    compensation claims were subject to an annual cumulative
    aggregate liability of up to $1.0 million on claims in
    excess of $2.0 million per occurrence. Our deductibles were
    generally lower in periods prior to August 1, 2008.

Performance Risk.

Margins may fluctuate
    because of the volume of work and the impacts of pricing and job
    productivity, which can be impacted both favorably and
    negatively by weather, geography, customer decisions and crew
    productivity. For example, when comparing a service contract
    between a current quarter and the comparable prior year’s
    quarter, factors affecting the gross margins associated with the
    revenues generated by the contract may include pricing under the
    contract, the volume of work performed under the contract, the
    mix of the type of work


specifically being performed and the productivity of the crews
    performing the work. Productivity of a crew can be influenced by
    many factors, including where the work is performed (

e.g.,

rural versus urban area or mountainous or rocky area versus
    open terrain), whether the work is on an open or encumbered
    right of way or the impacts of inclement weather. These types of
    factors are not practicable to quantify through accounting data,
    but each may have a direct impact on the gross margin of a
    specific project.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily
    of compensation and related benefits to management,
    administrative salaries and benefits, marketing, office rent and
    utilities, communications, professional fees, bad debt expense,
    acquisition costs, gains and losses on the sale of property and
    equipment, letter of credit fees and maintenance, training and
    conversion costs related to the implementation of information
    technology systems.

Revenues.

Revenues increased
    $613.1 million, or 18.5%, to $3.93 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2010. Revenues from natural gas and
    pipeline infrastructure services increased $618.6 million,
    or 78.8%, to $1.40 billion and fiber optic licensing
    revenues increased $19.5 million, or 22.4%, to
    $106.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
    Revenues from natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services
    increased primarily as a result of revenue contributions from
    Price Gregory, which was acquired on October 1, 2009.
    Revenues from fiber optic licensing increased primarily as a
    result of continued network expansion and the associated
    revenues from licensing the right to use point to point fiber
    optic telecommunications facilities. These increases were
    partially offset by lower revenues from electric power
    infrastructure services, which decreased $19.6 million, or
    0.9%, to


$2.05 billion, primarily due to the timing of major
    transmission projects and decreases in spending by our customers.

Gross profit.

Gross profit increased
    $40.9 million, or 6.9%, to $634.4 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2010. The increase in gross profit was
    predominantly due to the contribution of gas transmission
    service revenues during 2010, primarily as the result of the
    acquisition of Price Gregory. As a percentage of revenues, gross
    margin decreased to 16.1% for the year ended December 31,
    2010 from 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    primarily as a result of decreases in gross margins in electric
    power, natural gas and pipeline and telecommunications
    infrastructure services. The decrease in electric power margins
    is primarily the result of lower overall levels of profit being
    contributed from higher margin electric  transmission services
    as a result of the timing of major projects discussed above.
    Although overall levels of gas transmission service revenues and
    gross profit increased in 2010 as compared to 2009, gross
    margins earned for 2010 were negatively impacted by
    unanticipated delays and difficult weather conditions, which led
    to higher costs on certain large gas transmission jobs.
    Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in gross
    margin in fiber optic licensing services.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased $27.3 million, or 8.7%, to
    $339.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
    Selling, general and administrative expenses increased
    approximately $20.3 million as a result of the addition of
    administrative expenses associated with the Price Gregory
    acquisition and, to a lesser extent, the Valard acquisition. In
    addition, acquisition and integration costs of
    $10.6 million were incurred in 2010 compared to
    $2.8 million in 2009. The costs for the ongoing
    implementation of technology solutions also increased
    $1.5 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. Partially
    offsetting these increases was a decrease in net losses on sales
    of equipment, which were $4.7 million during 2010, as
    compared to $8.0 million in 2009. Included in the
    $8.0 million in net losses in 2009 was an impairment charge
    of $4.5 million for assets held for sale at
    December 31, 2009 related to natural gas segment equipment
    that was deemed to be duplicative as a result of the Price
    Gregory acquisition. As a percentage of revenues, selling,
    general and administrative expenses decreased to 8.6% from 9.4%
    primarily due to a better ability to cover fixed costs as a
    result of higher revenues earned in 2010.

Amortization of intangible
    assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    decreased $0.4 million to $38.6 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2010. This decrease is primarily due to
    reduced amortization expense from previously acquired intangible
    assets as balances became fully amortized, offset by increased
    amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisitions of
    Valard on October 25, 2010 and Price Gregory on
    October 1, 2009.

Interest expense.

Interest expense for the
    year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $6.4 million as
    compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due
    to the redemption of all of our 3.75% convertible subordinated
    notes due 2026 (3.75% Notes) on May 14, 2010.

Interest income.

Interest income was
    $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010,
    compared to $2.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. The decrease results primarily from
    substantially lower interest rates earned for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Loss on early extinguishment of debt.

Loss on
    early extinguishment of debt was $7.1 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2010. The loss on early extinguishment
    of debt is a result of the redemption of all of the outstanding
    3.75% Notes on May 14, 2010. This loss includes a
    non-cash loss of $3.5 million related to the difference
    between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value on
    the 3.75% Notes calculated as of the date of redemption,
    the payment of $2.3 million representing the 1.607%
    redemption premium above par value and a non-cash loss of
    $1.3 million from the write-off of the remaining
    unamortized deferred financing costs related to the
    3.75% Notes.

Provision for income taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes was $90.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010, with an effective tax rate of 36.8%. The
    provision for income taxes was $70.2 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009, with an effective tax rate of
    30.0%. The effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were impacted
    by the recording of tax benefits in the amount of
    $10.5 million in 2010 and $23.7 million in 2009
    associated with decreases in reserves for uncertain tax
    positions resulting from the expiration of various federal and
    state statutes of limitations.


    compared to 2008

Revenues.

Revenues decreased
    $462.1 million, or 12.2%, to $3.32 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2009. Electric power infrastructure
    services revenues decreased $233.7 million, or 10.2%, to
    $2.07 billion, telecommunications infrastructure services
    revenues decreased $158.4 million, or 29.5%, to
    $378.4 million and natural gas and pipeline infrastructure
    services revenues decreased $94.9 million, or 10.8%, to
    $784.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
    Overall, revenues were negatively impacted by decreases in the
    number and size of projects as a result of reduced capital
    spending by our customers. Additionally, revenues from electric
    power infrastructure services were also impacted by a decrease
    of approximately $126.5 million in revenues from emergency
    restoration services, from approximately $206.3 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 to approximately
    $79.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    due to work performed following hurricanes Fay, Gustav and Ike
    during the third and fourth quarters of 2008 in the Gulf Coast
    region of the United States. These decreases were partially
    offset by approximately $245.1 million in natural gas and
    pipeline services revenues contributed by Price Gregory for the
    period from October 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009.
    Additionally, revenues from fiber optic licensing increased
    $24.9 million, or 40.0%, to $87.3 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009. This increase in revenues is
    primarily a result of our continued network expansion and the
    associated revenues from licensing the right to use

point-to-point

fiber optic telecommunications facilities.

Gross profit.

Gross profit decreased
    $41.4 million, or 6.5%, to $593.5 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in gross profit
    resulted primarily from the effect of the decreased revenues
    discussed above. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin
    increased to 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009
    from 16.8% for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily
    as a result of increased revenues from our higher margin
    electric transmission services combined with improved margins in
    telecommunications infrastructure services. Gross margins in
    2009 were favorably impacted by increased fiber optic licensing
    revenues, which typically generate higher gross margins than our
    other services. In addition, gross margins for our
    telecommunications infrastructure services were negatively
    affected in 2008 by losses on a project ongoing during the year,
    which resulted from substantial delays and productivity issues
    on the project.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased $3.0 million, or 1.0%, to
    $312.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
    Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by
    $7.5 million for the period October 1, 2009 through
    December 31, 2009 as a result of the Price Gregory
    acquisition. In addition, acquisition and ongoing integration
    costs of $2.8 million were incurred in 2009, primarily in
    connection with the Price Gregory acquisition. Also contributing
    to the increase were $8.0 million in net losses on sales of
    equipment during 2009, as compared to losses of
    $2.5 million in 2008. Included in the $8.0 million in
    net losses in 2009 was an impairment charge of $4.5 million
    for assets held for sale at December 31, 2009 related to
    natural gas segment equipment that was deemed to be duplicative
    as a result of the Price Gregory acquisition. These increases
    were partially offset by a decrease in performance bonuses of
    approximately $11.8 million. As a percentage of revenues,
    selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 9.4%
    from 8.2% primarily due to less ability to cover fixed costs as
    a result of lower revenues earned in 2009 than in 2008.

Amortization of intangible
    assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    increased $2.7 million to $39.0 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009. This increase is primarily due to
    increased amortization of backlog related to the acquisition of
    Price Gregory on October 1, 2009, partially offset by
    reduced amortization expense from previously acquired intangible
    assets as balances became fully amortized.

Interest expense.

Interest expense for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $20.7 million
    as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily
    due to the conversion, redemption and repurchase of all
    outstanding 4.5% convertible subordinated notes that occurred in
    September and early October of 2008.

Interest income.

Interest income was
    $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    compared to $9.8 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The decrease results primarily from
    substantially lower interest rates partially offset by a higher
    average cash balance for the year ended December 31, 2009
    as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.


Provision for income taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes was $70.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, with an effective tax rate of 30.0%. The
    provision for income taxes was $109.7 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, with an effective tax rate of
    41.0%. The lower effective tax rate for 2009 results primarily
    from $23.7 million of tax benefits recorded in 2009
    associated with decreases in reserves for uncertain tax
    positions resulting from the expiration of various federal and
    state statutes of limitations.

Electric
    Power Infrastructure Services Segment Results

Revenues for this segment decreased $19.6 million, or 0.9%,
    to $2.05 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010.
    Revenues were negatively impacted primarily by a reduction in
    electric power transmission services related to the timing of
    major transmission projects. Partially offsetting this decrease
    was an increase in revenues from other electric power
    infrastructure services, as well as approximately
    $25.7 million in revenues contributed from Valard, which
    was acquired on October 25, 2010. Additionally, revenues were
    positively impacted by an increase of approximately
    $16.7 million in revenues from emergency restoration
    services, to approximately $96.5 million in 2010 from
    approximately $79.8 million in 2009. This increase is
    primarily due to the increased work associated with ice storms
    in the United States during the first quarter of 2010.

Operating income decreased $16.2 million, or 7.2%, to
    $209.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010,
    as compared to $226.1 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, while operating income as a percentage
    of revenues decreased to 10.2% for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 from 10.9% for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. These decreases are primarily the result
    of lower levels of profit being contributed from higher margin
    electric transmission services due to the timing of major
    transmission projects discussed above, coupled with a more
    competitive pricing environment for smaller scale transmission
    projects and distribution services. In addition, margins were
    lower on emergency restoration services performed in 2010 as
    compared to 2009.

Natural
    Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services Segment
    Results

Revenues for this segment increased $618.6 million, or
    78.8%, to $1.40 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. This increase is due to the incremental
    contribution of natural gas transmission service revenues


primarily from the operations of Price Gregory, which was
    acquired on October 1, 2009.

Operating income increased $56.5 million, or 90.2%, to
    $119.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
    Operating income as a percentage of revenues increased to 8.5%
    for the year ended December 31, 2010 from 8.0% for the year
    ended December 31, 2009. The increases in operating income
    and operating margin are primarily due to the increased revenue
    contributions resulting from the acquisition of Price Gregory,
    which led to a change in the mix of services to a greater volume
    of higher margin gas transmission services in 2010 as compared
    to 2009, as well as the impact of higher overall revenues on
    this segment’s ability to cover fixed costs.

Telecommunications
    Infrastructure Services Segment Results

Revenues for this segment decreased $5.4 million, or 1.4%,
    to $372.9 million for the year ended December 31,
    2010, primarily due to lower revenues from fiber build-out
    initiatives as a result of continued reduced capital spending by
    our customers during 2010 as compared to 2009. This decrease in
    revenues was partially offset by an increase in the volume of
    work associated with long-haul fiber installation during the
    year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the 2009 period.

Operating income decreased $10.5 million, or 41.4%, to
    $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as
    compared to operating income of $25.3 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009. Operating income as a percentage
    of revenues decreased from 6.7% for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 to 4.0% for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. These decreases are primarily due to the
    impact of losses incurred during the first quarter of 2010 as a
    result of weather related slowdowns impacting this
    segment’s productivity, coupled with lower overall margins
    on work performed in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to a change in
    the mix of the types of services performed during 2010 as a
    result of continued reduced capital spending by our customers.

Fiber
    Optic Licensing Segment Results

Revenues for this segment increased $19.5 million, or
    22.4%, to $106.8 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. This increase in revenues is primarily a
    result of our continued network expansion and the associated
    revenues from licensing the right to use

point-to-point

fiber optic telecommunications facilities.

Operating income increased $8.6 million, or 19.4%, to
    $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010,
    primarily as a result of the increased revenues discussed above.
    Operating income as a percentage of revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 remained relatively constant.

Corporate
    and Non-allocated Costs

Certain selling, general and administrative expenses and
    amortization of intangible assets are not allocated to segments.
    Corporate and non-allocated costs for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 increased $24.3 million to
    $140.5 million. The increase is primarily due to an
    increase in salaries and benefits costs of approximately
    $11.1 million from increased

non-cash

stock compensation as well as higher personnel and incentive
    compensation expenses associated with current levels of
    operating activity. In addition, acquisition and ongoing
    integration costs of $10.6 million were incurred in 2010
    compared to $2.8 million in 2009. Also, the costs for the
    ongoing implementation of technology solutions increased
    $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010
    as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.

    compared to 2008

Electric
    Power Infrastructure Services Segment Results

Revenues for this segment decreased $233.7 million, or
    10.2%, to $2.07 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Revenues were negatively impacted by a
    decrease of approximately $126.5 million in revenues from
    emergency restoration services, to approximately
    $79.8 million for 2009 from approximately
    $206.3 million in 2008. This decrease resulted from work
    following hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region of the United
    States during 2008 which was only partially offset by emergency
    restoration services related to ice storms in the first quarter
    of 2009. Emergency restoration services associated with these
    hurricanes continued into the first


quarter of 2009; however, no major hurricanes impacted the
    United States during 2009. Revenues were also negatively
    impacted by a decrease in electric power distribution services
    and other electric power infrastructure services primarily from
    reduced service work and capital spending by our customers,
    which was partially offset by increased revenues from electric
    transmission services related to an increased number of larger
    projects being performed in 2009.

Operating income decreased $21.6 million, or 8.7%, for the
    year ended December 31, 2009, as a result of the reduced
    revenues discussed above. Operating income as a percentage of
    revenues increased slightly to 10.9% for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 from 10.8% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Although there was a substantial
    decrease in emergency restoration services in 2009, which
    typically generate higher margins, the increased contribution in
    2009 from higher margin electric transmission services as well
    as generally higher margins for other services in this segment
    offset this decrease. In addition, general and administrative
    expenses decreased approximately $6.2 million primarily due
    to decreased salaries and benefits expense associated with lower
    performance bonuses.

Natural
    Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services Segment
    Results

Revenues for this segment decreased $94.9 million, or
    10.8%, to $784.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. This decrease is primarily due to a
    decrease in gas distribution services of $73.4 million due
    to reduced capital spending by our customers resulting in
    reductions in the number and size of projects during the period.
    Additionally, natural gas transmission revenues contributed by
    Price Gregory, which was acquired on October 1, 2009, were
    approximately $245.1 million, which offset year over year
    decreases in other natural gas transmission revenues of
    $246.7 million resulting from larger projects during 2008
    that were not replaced in 2009.

Operating income decreased $13.5 million, or 17.7%, to
    $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as
    a result of the decreased revenues discussed above. Operating
    income as a percentage of revenues decreased to 8.0% for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 from 8.7% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The decrease in operating margins is
    primarily due to the lower overall revenues and the related
    impact on this segment’s ability to cover fixed costs,
    coupled with losses of $4.5 million on natural gas segment
    assets held for sale that were deemed to be duplicative assets
    as a result of the acquisition and integration of Price Gregory.
    These decreases were partially offset by the contribution of
    Price Gregory’s higher margin transmission pipeline work.

Telecommunications
    Infrastructure Services Segment Results

Revenues for this segment decreased $158.4 million, or
    29.5%, to $378.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 primarily due to reduced capital spending
    for fiber build-out initiatives during 2009. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, revenues from fiber build-out
    initiatives decreased approximately $114.5 million to
    approximately $147.8 million as compared to approximately
    $262.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    Revenues were also negatively impacted by a decrease in the
    number and size of other telecommunications projects as a result
    of overall reduced capital spending by our customers in 2009 as
    compared to 2008.

Operating income decreased $16.6 million, or 39.5%, to
    $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as
    a result of the decreased revenues discussed above. Operating
    income as a percentage of revenues decreased to 6.7% for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 from 7.8% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. This decrease is a result of the lower
    overall revenues and the related impact on this segment’s
    ability to cover fixed costs during 2009.

Fiber
    Optic Licensing Segment Results

Revenues for this segment increased from $62.3 million, or
    40.0%, to $87.3 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. This increase in revenues is primarily a
    result of our continued network expansion and the associated
    revenues from licensing the right to use

point-to-point

fiber optic telecommunications facilities.

Operating income increased $11.4 million, or 34.7%, to
    $44.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as
    a result of the increased revenues discussed above. Operating
    income as a percentage of revenues decreased to 50.6% from 52.6%
    primarily as a result of the timing of various system
    maintenance costs.


Corporate
    and Non-allocated Costs

Certain selling, general and administrative expenses and
    amortization of intangible assets are not allocated to segments.
    Corporate and non-allocated costs for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 increased $6.8 million to
    $116.1 million primarily due to a $2.9 million
    increase in non-capitalized costs associated with an ongoing
    implementation of information technology solutions, coupled with
    acquisition and integration costs of approximately
    $2.8 million incurred in 2009, principally related to the
    Price Gregory acquisition, and an increase in amortization of
    intangible assets of $2.7 million. This increase in
    amortization of intangible assets is primarily due to increased
    amortization of backlog related to the acquisition of Price
    Gregory on October 1, 2009, partially offset by reduced
    amortization expense from previously acquired intangible assets
    as balances became fully amortized. These increases were
    partially offset by decreases due to lower salaries and benefits
    expense in 2009 associated with lower performance bonuses.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Cash
    Requirements

We anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, which
    totaled $539.2 million as of December 31, 2010,
    existing borrowing capacity under our credit facility, and our
    future cash flows from operations will provide sufficient funds
    to enable us to meet our future operating needs, debt service
    requirements and planned capital expenditures, as well as
    facilitate our ability to grow in the foreseeable future. We
    also evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions from time
    to time that may require cash. In addition, we evaluate
    opportunities to make investments in customer-sponsored projects
    where we anticipate performing services such as project
    management, engineering, procurement or construction services,
    and we believe such investments enhance our ability to secure
    such services. These investment opportunities exist in the
    markets and industries we serve and may take the form of debt or
    equity investments, which may require cash.

Management continues to monitor the financial markets and
    general national and global economic conditions. We consider our
    cash investment policies to be conservative in that we maintain
    a diverse portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality cash
    investments with short-term maturities. We were in compliance
    with our covenants under our credit facility at
    December 31, 2010. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that
    any weakness in the capital markets will have a material impact
    on the principal amounts of our cash investments or our ability
    to rely upon our existing credit facility for funds. To date, we
    have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash
    equivalents or funds under our credit facility; however, we can
    provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash
    equivalents will not be impacted in the future by adverse
    conditions in the financial markets.

Capital expenditures are expected to be between
    $180 million to $210 million for 2011. Approximately
    $30 million to $35 million of the expected 2011
    capital expenditures are targeted for the expansion of our fiber
    optic networks.

Sources
    and Uses of Cash

As of December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents
    of $539.2 million, working capital of $1.10 billion
    and a nominal amount of long-term obligations. We also had
    $177.0 million of letters of credit outstanding under our
    credit facility, leaving $298.0 million available for
    revolving loans or issuing new letters of credit.

Operating
    Activities

Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for
    our services, operating margins and the type of services we
    provide, but can also be influenced by working capital needs, in
    particular on larger projects, due to the timing of collection
    of receivables and the settlement of payables and other
    obligations. Working capital needs are generally higher during
    the summer and fall months due to increased demand for our
    services when favorable weather conditions exist in certain
    regions of the country. Conversely, working capital assets are
    typically converted to cash during the winter months.

Operating activities provided net cash to us of
    $240.3 million during 2010 as compared to
    $376.9 million during 2009 and $242.5 million during
    2008. The operating cash flows in 2009 were higher than in 2010
    and 2008


primarily due to the collection of large  accounts receivable
    and retainage balances in 2009 that were outstanding at the end
    of 2008. Additionally, operating cash flows in 2010 were
    negatively impacted as a result of an increase in working
    capital levels at December 31, 2010 as compared to 2009
    primarily due to the timing of production and billing milestones
    on certain large gas transmission projects.

Investing
    Activities

During 2010, we used net cash in investing activities of
    $254.3 million as compared to $119.7 million and
    $219.3 million used in investing activities in 2009 and
    2008. Investing activities in 2010 included $130.3 million
    of net cash used in connection with our acquisition of Valard
    and $149.7 million used for capital expenditures, partially
    offset by $25.7 million of proceeds from the sale of
    equipment. Investing activities in 2009 included
    $36.2 million of net cash acquired primarily as a result of
    our acquisition of Price Gregory. During 2009 and 2008, we used
    $165.0 million and $185.6 million for capital
    expenditures, partially offset by $9.1 million and
    $15.4 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment.
    Investing activities during 2008 also include $34.5 million
    in net cash outlays for three acquisitions and
    $14.6 million paid to secure patents and developed
    technology.

Financing
    Activities

In 2010, we used net cash in financing activities of
    $145.7 million as compared to $1.5 million provided by
    financing activities in 2009 and $8.2 million provided by
    financing activities in 2008. Financing activities in 2010
    included $143.8 million in payments for the redemption of
    the aggregate principal amount of our 3.75% Notes,
    described in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8.

“Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data”

, as well as $2.3 million in
    net repayments of other borrowings during the year ended
    December 31, 2010. Additionally, we made a
    $2.4 million cash payment to a noncontrolling interest as a
    distribution of profits. These outflows were partially offset by
    $2.2 million in tax impacts from stock-based equity awards
    and $0.5 million received from the exercise of stock
    options. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2009
    resulted primarily from  $2.0 million in net proceeds from
    borrowings, coupled with cash inflows of $1.0 million from
    the exercise of stock options. These inflows were partially
    offset by a $1.5 million tax impact from the vesting of
    stock-based equity awards. Net cash provided by financing
    activities in 2008 resulted primarily from $6.0 million
    received from the exercise of stock options.

Debt
    Instruments

Credit
    Facility

We have an agreement with various lenders that provides for a
    $475.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility
    maturing on September 19, 2012. Subject to the conditions
    specified in the credit facility, borrowings under the credit
    facility are to be used for working capital, capital
    expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The entire
    unused portion of the credit facility is available for the
    issuance of letters of credit.

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately
    $177.0 million of letters of credit issued under the credit
    facility and no outstanding revolving loans. The remaining
    $298.0 million was available for revolving loans or issuing
    new letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the credit
    facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either
    (a) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the credit facility)
    plus 0.875% to 1.75%, as determined by the ratio of our total
    funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit
    facility), or (b) the base rate (as described below) plus
    0.00% to 0.75%, as determined by the ratio of our total funded
    debt to consolidated EBITDA. Letters of credit issued under the
    credit facility are subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.875%
    to 1.75%, based on the ratio of our total funded debt to
    consolidated EBITDA. We are also subject to a commitment fee of
    0.15% to 0.35%, based on the ratio of our total funded debt to
    consolidated EBITDA, on any unused availability under the credit
    facility. The base rate equals the higher of (i) the
    Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus


/


of 1% or (ii) the bank’s prime rate.

The credit facility contains certain covenants, including
    covenants with respect to maximum funded debt to consolidated
    EBITDA, maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA and minimum
    interest coverage, in each case as specified in the credit
    facility. For purposes of calculating the maximum funded debt to
    consolidated EBITDA ratio and the maximum senior debt to
    consolidated EBITDA ratio, our maximum funded debt and maximum
    senior debt are reduced by all cash and cash equivalents (as
    defined in the credit facility) held by us in excess of
    $25.0 million. As of December 31, 2010, we were in
    compliance with all of its covenants. The credit


facility limits certain acquisitions, mergers and
    consolidations, capital expenditures, asset sales and
    prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to certain exceptions,
    prohibits liens on material assets. The credit facility also
    limits the payment of dividends and stock repurchase programs in
    any fiscal year except those payments or other distributions
    payable solely in capital stock. The credit facility provides
    for customary events of default and carries cross-default
    provisions with our continuing indemnity and security agreement
    with our sureties and all of our other debt instruments
    exceeding $15.0 million in borrowings. If an event of
    default (as defined in the credit facility) occurs and is
    continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
    in the credit facility, amounts outstanding under the credit
    facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared
    immediately due and payable.

The credit facility is secured by a pledge of the capital stock
    of certain of our subsidiaries and substantially all of our
    assets. Our U.S. subsidiaries also guarantee the repayment
    of all amounts due under the credit facility.

3.75% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

As of December 31, 2010, none of our 3.75% Notes were
    outstanding. The 3.75% Notes were originally issued in
    April 2006 for an aggregate principal amount of
    $143.8 million and required semi-annual interest payments
    on April 30 and October 30 until maturity.

On May 14, 2010, we redeemed all of the $143.8 million
    aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 3.75% Notes
    at a redemption price of 101.607% of the principal amount of the
    notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including,
    the date of redemption. The redemption resulted in the payment
    of the aggregate redemption price of $146.1 million and the
    recognition of a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately
    $7.1 million. Included in the loss on early extinguishment
    of debt was a non-cash loss of $3.5 million related to the
    difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair
    value of the 3.75% Notes calculated as of the date of
    redemption, the payment of $2.3 million representing the
    1.607% redemption premium above par value and a non-cash loss of
    $1.3 million from the write-off of the remaining
    unamortized deferred financing costs related to the
    3.75% Notes.

The $126.6 million of convertible subordinated notes on the
    consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 was
    presented net of a debt discount of $17.2 million, which
    was being amortized as interest expense. The effective interest
    rate that was used to calculate total interest expense for the
    3.75% Notes was 7.85%.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Transactions

As is common in our industry, we have entered into certain
    off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of
    business that result in risks not directly reflected in our
    balance sheets. Our significant off-balance sheet transactions
    include liabilities associated with non-cancelable operating
    leases, letter of credit obligations, commitments to expand our
    fiber optic networks, surety guarantees, multi-employer pension
    plan liabilities and obligations relating to certain joint
    venture arrangements. Certain joint venture structures involve
    risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets. For certain
    joint ventures, we have guaranteed all of the obligations of the
    joint venture under a contract with the customer. Additionally,
    other joint venture arrangements qualify as a general
    partnership, for which we are jointly and severally liable for
    all of the obligations of the joint venture. In each joint
    venture arrangement, each joint venturer has indemnified the
    other party for any liabilities incurred in excess of the
    liabilities for which such other party is obligated to bear
    under the respective joint venture agreement. Other than as
    previously discussed, we have not engaged in any material
    off-balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose
    entities, and we have no material guarantees of the work or
    obligations of third parties.

Leases

We enter into non-cancelable operating leases for many of our
    facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow us to
    conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of
    facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them.
    We may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of
    its term, in which case we are typically liable to the lessor
    for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease.

We have guaranteed the residual value of the underlying assets
    under certain of our equipment operating leases at the date of
    termination of such leases. We have agreed to pay any difference
    between this residual value and the


fair market value of each underlying asset as of the lease
    termination date. As of December 31, 2010, the maximum
    guaranteed residual value was approximately $116.4 million.
    We believe that no significant payments will be made as a result
    of the difference between the fair market value of the leased
    equipment and the guaranteed residual value. However, there can
    be no assurance that future significant payments will not be
    required.

Letters
    of Credit

Certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure
    reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf,
    such as to beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance
    programs. In addition, from time to time some customers require
    us to post letters of credit to ensure payment to our
    subcontractors and vendors under those contracts and to
    guarantee performance under our contracts. Such letters of
    credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial
    institution. The letter of credit commits the issuer to pay
    specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the
    holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified
    actions. If this were to occur, we would be required to
    reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the
    circumstances of such a reimbursement, we may also have to
    record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. We do not
    believe that it is likely that any claims will be made under a
    letter of credit in the foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2010, we had $177.0 million in
    letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility
    primarily to secure obligations under our casualty insurance
    program. These are irrevocable stand-by letters of credit with
    maturities generally expiring at various times throughout 2011.
    Upon maturity, it is expected that the majority of these letters
    of credit will be renewed for subsequent one-year periods.

Performance
    Bonds and Parent Guarantees

Many customers, particularly in connection with new
    construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds
    issued by a financial institution known as a surety. These bonds
    provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under
    the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and
    vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay
    subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the
    surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must
    reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs.
    Under our continuing indemnity and security agreement with our
    sureties and with the consent of our lenders under our credit
    facility, we have granted security interests in certain of our
    assets to collateralize our obligations to the sureties. In
    addition, we have assumed obligations with other sureties with
    respect to bonds issued on behalf of acquired companies that
    were outstanding as of the applicable dates of acquisition. To
    the extent these bonds have not expired or been replaced, we may
    be required to transfer to the applicable sureties certain of
    our assets as collateral in the event of default under these
    other agreements. We may be required to post letters of credit
    or other collateral in favor of the sureties or our customers in
    the future. Posting letters of credit in favor of the sureties
    or our customers would reduce the borrowing availability under
    our credit facility. To date, we have not been required to make
    any reimbursements to our sureties for bond-related costs. We
    believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund
    significant claims under our surety arrangements in the
    foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2010, the total
    amount of outstanding performance bonds was approximately
    $1.10 billion, and the estimated cost to complete these
    bonded projects was approximately $521.4 million.

From time to time, we guarantee the obligations of our wholly
    owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain
    contracts with customers, certain lease obligations and, in some
    states, obligations in connection with obtaining
    contractors’ licenses.

The committed capital expenditures for fiber optic networks
    represent commitments related to signed contracts with
    customers. The amounts are estimates of costs required to build
    the networks under contract. The actual capital expenditures
    related to building the networks could vary materially from
    these estimates.

As of December 31, 2010, the total unrecognized tax
    benefits related to uncertain tax positions was
    $50.6 million. We estimate that none of this will be paid
    within the next twelve months. However, we believe that it is
    reasonably possible that within the next twelve months
    unrecognized tax benefits may decrease up to $8.8 million
    due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. We are
    unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the
    timing of future cash outflows, if any, associated with the
    remaining unrecognized tax benefits.

The above table does not reflect estimated contractual
    obligations under the multi-employer pension plans in which our
    union employees participate. Certain of our operating units are
    parties to various collective bargaining agreements that require
    us to provide to the employees subject to these agreements
    specified wages and benefits, as well as to make contributions
    to multi-employer pension plans. Our multi-employer pension plan
    contribution rates are determined annually and assessed on a
    “pay-as-you-go” basis based on our union employee
    payrolls, which cannot be determined for future periods because
    the location and number of union employees that we have employed
    at any given time and the plans in which they may participate
    vary depending on the projects we have ongoing at any time and
    the need for union resources in connection with those projects.
    Additionally, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
    1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments
    Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are
    contributors to a multi-employer plan in the event of the
    employer’s withdrawal from, or upon termination of, such
    plan. None of our operating units have any current plans to
    withdraw from these plans, and accordingly, no withdrawal
    liabilities are reflected in the above table. We may also be
    required to make additional contributions to our multi-employer
    pension plans if they become underfunded, and these additional
    contributions will be determined based on our union employee
    payrolls. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding
    rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007
    for multi-employer plans that are classified as
    “endangered,” “seriously endangered,” or
    “critical” status. For a plan in critical status,
    additional required contributions and benefit reductions may
    apply. A number of multi-employer plans to which Quanta
    operating units contribute or may contribute in the future are
    in “critical” status. Certain of these plans may
    require additional contributions, generally in the form of a
    surcharge on future benefit contributions required for future
    work performed by union employees covered by these plans. The
    amount of additional funds, if any, that we may be obligated to
    contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated and
    is not included in the above table, as such amounts will likely
    be based on future levels of work that require the specific use
    of those union employees covered by these plans.

Self-Insurance

We are insured for employer’s liability, general liability,
    auto liability and workers’ compensation claims. Since
    August 1, 2009, all policy deductible levels are
    $5.0 million per occurrence, other than employer’s
    liability, which is subject to a deductible of
    $1.0 million. We also have employee health care benefit
    plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining
    agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible
    of $350,000 per claimant per year. For the policy year ended
    July 31, 2009, employer’s liability claims were
    subject to a deductible of $1.0 million per occurrence,
    general liability and auto liability claims were subject to a
    deductible of


$3.0 million per occurrence, and workers’ compensation
    claims were subject to a deductible of $2.0 million per
    occurrence. Additionally, for the policy year ended
    July 31, 2009, our workers’ compensation claims were
    subject to an annual cumulative aggregate liability of up to
    $1.0 million on claims in excess of $2.0 million per
    occurrence. Our deductibles were generally lower in periods
    prior to August 1, 2008.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported
    and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
    assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance
    liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
    factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of
    damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to
    other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The
    accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and
    management believes such accruals are adequate. As of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the gross amount accrued for
    insurance claims totaled $216.8 million and
    $184.7 million, with $164.3 million and
    $130.1 million considered to be long-term and included in
    other non-current liabilities. Related insurance
    recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2010 and 2009
    were $66.3 million and $33.7 million, of which
    $9.4 million and $13.4 million are included in prepaid
    expenses and other current assets and $56.9 million and
    $20.3 million are included in other assets, net.

We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and
    therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may
    change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel our
    coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or
    the cost to obtain such coverage may become unreasonable. In any
    such event, our overall risk exposure would increase which could
    negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition
    and cash flows.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

We are subject to concentrations of credit risk related
    primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and our accounts
    receivable, including amounts related to unbilled accounts
    receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of
    billings on uncompleted contracts. Substantially all of our cash
    investments are managed by what we believe to be high credit
    quality financial institutions. In accordance with our
    investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest
    this cash in a diversified portfolio of what we believe to be
    high quality investments, which primarily include
    interest-bearing demand deposits, money market mutual funds and
    investment grade commercial paper with original maturities of
    three months or less. Although we do not currently believe the
    principal amount of these investments is subject to any material
    risk of loss, the weakness in the economy has significantly
    impacted the interest income we receive from these investments
    and is likely to continue to do so in the future. In addition,
    we grant credit under normal payment terms, generally without
    collateral, to our customers, which include electric power,
    natural gas and pipeline companies, telecommunications service
    providers, governmental entities, general contractors, and
    builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial
    properties located primarily in the United States and Canada.
    Consequently, we are subject to potential credit risk related to
    changes in business and economic factors throughout the United
    States and Canada, which may be heightened as a result of
    depressed economic and financial market conditions that have
    existed over the past two years. However, we generally have
    certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided.
    Under certain circumstances, such as foreclosures or negotiated
    settlements, we may take title to the underlying assets in lieu
    of cash in settlement of receivables. In such circumstances,
    extended time frames may be required to liquidate these assets,
    causing the amounts realized to differ from the value of the
    assumed receivable. Historically, some of our customers have
    experienced significant financial difficulties, and others may
    experience financial difficulties in the future. These
    difficulties expose us to increased risk related to
    collectability of receivables and costs and estimated earnings
    in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts for services we
    have performed. One customer accounted for approximately 11% of
    consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31,
    2010 and approximately 12% of billed and accrued receivables at
    December 31, 2010. Business with this customer is included
    in the Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment.
    No other customer represented 10% or more of revenues during the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008 or of accounts
    receivable as of December 31, 2010 or 2009.

Litigation

We are from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and
    other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These actions typically seek, among other things,
    compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract

and/or

property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
    losses, or injunctive or


declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims
    and proceedings, we record a reserve when it is probable that a
    liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be
    reasonably estimated. In addition, we disclose matters for which
    management believes a material loss is at least reasonably
    possible. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8.

“Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data”

for additional
    information regarding litigation and claims.

Related
    Party Transactions

In the normal course of business, we enter into transactions
    from time to time with related parties. These transactions
    typically take the form of facility leases with prior owners of
    certain acquired companies and payables to prior owners who are
    now employees.

Inflation

Due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, inflation did
    not have a significant effect on our results.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements.

On
    January 1, 2010, we adopted new standards aimed to improve
    the visibility of off-balance sheet vehicles previously exempt
    from consolidation and address practice issues involving the
    accounting for transfers of financial assets as sales or secured
    borrowings. The impact from the adoption of these new standards
    was not material.

During the quarter ended December 31, 2010, we adopted a
    new standard to improve disclosures related to finance
    receivables (defined as a contractual right to receive money, on
    demand or on fixed or determinable dates, that is recognized as
    an asset on the creditor’s balance sheet) and allowances
    for credit losses. The impact from the adoption of this new
    standard was not material.

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU

2010-29,

Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for
    Business Combinations

.  The update requires the
    pro forma information for business combinations to be presented
    as if the business combination occurred at the beginning of the
    prior annual reporting period when calculating both the current
    reporting period and the prior reporting period pro forma
    financial information. The update also expands the supplemental
    pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and
    amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly
    attributable to the business combination. The amended guidance
    is effective prospectively for business combinations for which
    the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2010. We adopted the update in the fourth quarter of 2010. The
    impact from this update was not material.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
    results of operations are based on our consolidated financial
    statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
    The preparation of these consolidated financial statements
    requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of
    contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date
    the consolidated financial statements are published and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the
    periods presented. We review all significant estimates affecting
    our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and
    record the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their
    publication. Judgments and estimates are based on our beliefs
    and assumptions derived from information available at the time
    such judgments and estimates are made. Uncertainties with
    respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the
    preparation of financial statements. There can be no assurance
    that actual results will not differ from those estimates.
    Management has reviewed its development and selection of
    critical accounting


estimates with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. We
    believe the following accounting policies affect our more
    significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of
    our consolidated financial statements:

Revenue
    Recognition

Infrastructure Services

— Through our Electric
    Power Infrastructure Services, Natural Gas and Pipeline
    Infrastructure Services and Telecommunications Infrastructure
    Services segments, we design, install and maintain networks for
    the electric power, natural gas, oil, and telecommunications
    industries. These services may be provided pursuant to master
    service agreements, repair and maintenance contracts and fixed
    price and non-fixed price installation contracts. Pricing under
    these contracts may be competitive unit price, cost-plus/hourly
    (or time and materials basis) or fixed price (or lump sum
    basis), and the final terms and prices of these contracts are
    frequently negotiated with the customer. Under unit-based
    contracts, the utilization of an output-based measurement is
    appropriate for revenue recognition. Under these contracts, we
    recognize revenue as units are completed based on pricing
    established between us and the customer for each unit of
    delivery, which best reflects the pattern in which the
    obligation to the customer is fulfilled. Under our
    cost-plus/hourly and time and materials type contracts, we
    recognize revenue on an input basis, as labor hours are incurred
    and services are performed.

Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to
    total estimated costs for each contract. These contracts provide
    for a fixed amount of revenues for the entire project. Such
    contracts provide that the customer accept completion of
    progress to date and compensate us for services rendered, which
    may be measured in terms of units installed, hours expended or
    some other measure of progress. Contract costs include all
    direct materials, labor and subcontract costs and those indirect
    costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor,
    supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Much of the
    materials associated with our work are owner-furnished and are
    therefore not included in contract revenues and costs. The cost
    estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and
    experience of our engineers, project managers and financial
    professionals. Changes in job performance, job conditions and
    final contract settlements are factors that influence
    management’s assessment of total contract value and the
    total estimated costs to complete those contracts and therefore,
    our profit recognition. Changes in these factors may result in
    revisions to costs and income, and their effects are recognized
    in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions
    for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in
    which such losses are determined to be probable and the amount
    can be reasonably estimated. If actual results significantly
    differ from our estimates used for revenue recognition and claim
    assessments, our financial condition and results of operations
    could be materially impacted.

We may incur costs subject to change orders, whether approved or
    unapproved by the customer,

and/or

claims related to certain contracts. We determine the
    probability that such costs will be recovered based upon
    evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific
    discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer or
    verbal approvals. We treat items as a cost of contract
    performance in the period incurred if it is not probable that
    the costs will be recovered or will recognize revenue if it is
    probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be
    reliably estimated. As of December 31, 2010, we had
    approximately $83.1 million of change orders

and/or

claims that had been included as contract price adjustments on
    certain contracts which were in the process of being negotiated
    in the normal course of business.

The current asset “Costs and estimated earnings in excess
    of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents revenues
    recognized in excess of amounts billed for fixed price
    contracts. The current liability “Billings in excess of
    costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts”
    represents billings in excess of revenues recognized for fixed
    price contracts.

Fiber Optic Licensing

— The Fiber Optic
    Licensing segment constructs and licenses the right to use fiber
    optic telecommunications facilities to its customers pursuant to
    licensing agreements, typically with terms from five to
    twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal options. Under
    those agreements, customers are provided the right to use a
    portion of the capacity of a fiber optic facility, with the
    facility owned and maintained by us. Revenues, including any
    initial fees or advance billings, are recognized ratably over
    the expected length of the agreements, including probable
    renewal periods. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, initial
    fees and advance billings on these licensing agreements not yet
    recorded in revenue were $44.4 million and
    $35.9 million and are recognized as


deferred revenue, with $34.7 million and $25.4 million
    considered to be long-term and included in other non-current
    liabilities. Actual revenues may differ from those estimates if
    the contracts are not renewed as expected.

Self-Insurance.

We are insured for
    employer’s liability, general liability, auto liability and
    workers’ compensation claims. Since August 1, 2009,
    policy deductible levels are $5.0 million per occurrence,
    other than employer’s liability, which is subject to a
    deductible of $1.0 million. We also have employee
    healthcare benefit plans for most employees not subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is
    subject to a deductible of $350,000 per claimant per year. For
    policy year ended July 31, 2009, employer’s liability
    claims were subject to a deductible of $1.0 million per
    occurrence, general liability and auto liability claims were
    subject to a deductible of $3.0 million per occurrence, and
    workers’ compensation claims were subject to a deductible
    of $2.0 million per occurrence. Additionally, for the
    policy year ended July 31, 2009, our workers’
    compensation claims were subject to an annual cumulative
    aggregate liability of up to $1.0 million on claims in
    excess of $2.0 million per occurrence. Our deductibles were
    generally lower in periods prior to August 1, 2008.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported
    and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
    assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance
    liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
    factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of
    damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to
    other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The
    accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and
    management believes such accruals are adequate. As of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the gross amount accrued for
    insurance claims totaled $216.8 million and
    $184.7 million, with $164.3 million and
    $130.1 million considered to be long-term and included in
    other non-current liabilities. Related insurance
    recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2010 and 2009
    were $66.3 million and $33.7 million, of which
    $9.4 million and $13.4 million are included in prepaid
    expenses and other current assets and $56.9 million and
    $20.3 million are included in other assets, net.

We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and
    therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may
    change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel our
    coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or
    the cost to obtain such coverage may become unreasonable. In any
    such event, our overall risk exposure would increase, which
    could negatively affect our results of operations and financial
    condition.

Valuation of Goodwill.

We have recorded
    goodwill in connection with our acquisitions. Goodwill is
    subject to an annual assessment for impairment using a two-step
    fair value-based test, which we perform at the operating unit
    level. Each of our operating units is organized into one of
    three internal divisions, which are closely aligned with our
    reportable segments, based on the predominant type of work
    performed by the operating unit at the point in time the
    divisional designation is made. Because separate measures of
    assets and cash flows are not produced or utilized by management
    to evaluate segment performance, our impairment assessments of
    our goodwill do not include any consideration of assets and cash
    flows by reportable segment. As a result, we have determined
    that our individual operating units represent our reporting
    units for the purpose of assessing goodwill impairments.

Our goodwill impairment assessment is performed annually at
    year-end, or more frequently if events or circumstances exist
    which indicate that goodwill may be impaired. For instance, a
    decrease in our market capitalization below book value, a
    significant change in business climate or a loss of a
    significant customer, among other things, may trigger the need
    for interim impairment testing of goodwill associated with one
    or all of our reporting units. The first step of the two-step
    fair value-based test involves comparing the fair value of each
    of our reporting units with its carrying value, including
    goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds
    its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step
    compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill. If the
    implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount,
    an impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction to goodwill
    with a corresponding charge to operating expense.

We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a
    weighted combination of the discounted cash flow, market
    multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches, with
    heavier weighting on the discounted cash flow method, as in
    management’s opinion, this method currently results in the
    most accurate calculation of a reporting unit’s fair value.
    Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment
    and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such
    estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates,
    operating margins, discount rates, weighted average costs of
    capital and future market conditions, among others. We believe
    that the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment
    assessments are reasonable and based on available market


information, but variations in any of the assumptions could
    result in materially different calculations of fair value and
    determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated.

Under the discounted cash flow method, we determine fair value
    based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit,
    discounted to present value using risk-adjusted industry
    discount rates, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk
    of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor
    would expect to earn. Cash flow projections are derived from
    budgeted amounts and operating forecasts (typically a three-year
    model) plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which
    are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are
    developed for each reporting unit using growth rates that
    management believes are reasonably likely to occur along with a
    terminal value derived from the reporting unit’s earnings
    before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
    The EBITDA multiples for each reporting unit are based on
    trailing twelve-month comparable industry data.

Under the market multiple and market capitalization approaches,
    we determine the estimated fair value of each of our reporting
    units by applying transaction multiples to each reporting
    unit’s projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate
    with similar historical calculations using either a one, two or
    three year average. For the market capitalization approach, we
    add a reasonable control premium, which is estimated as the
    premium that would be received in a sale of the reporting unit
    in an orderly transaction between market participants.

The projected cash flows and estimated levels of EBITDA by
    reporting unit were used to determine fair value under the three
    approaches discussed herein. The following table presents the
    significant estimates used by management in determining the fair
    values of our reporting units at December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008:

For recently acquired reporting units, a step one impairment
    test may not indicate an implied fair value that is
    substantially different from the reporting unit’s carrying
    value. Such similarities in value are generally an indication
    that management’s estimates of future cash flows associated
    with the recently acquired reporting unit remain relatively
    consistent with the assumptions that were used to derive its
    initial fair value. During the fourth quarter of 2010, a
    goodwill impairment analysis was performed for each of our
    operating units, which indicated that the implied fair value of
    each of our operating units was substantially in excess of
    carrying value. As discussed generally above, when evaluating
    the 2010 step one impairment test results, management considered
    many factors in determining whether or not an impairment of
    goodwill for any reporting unit was reasonably likely to occur
    in future periods, including future market conditions and the
    economic environment in which our reporting units were
    operating. Circumstances such as continued market declines, the
    loss of a major customer or other factors could impact the
    valuation of goodwill in future periods.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, a goodwill analysis was performed
    for each operating unit with estimates and industry comparables
    obtained from the electric power, natural gas and pipeline,
    telecommunications and fiber optic licensing industries. The

15-year

discounted cash flow model used for fiber optic licensing was
    based on the long-term nature of the underlying fiber network
    licensing agreements.

We assigned a higher weighting to the discounted cash flow
    approach during each year to reflect increased expectations of
    market value being determined from a “held and used”
    model. At December 31, 2009, we decreased EBITDA multiples
    at operating units from 2008 to reflect potential declines in
    market conditions as a result of the


continued effect of the economic recession which began in late
    2008. At December 31, 2010, certain EBITDA multiples were
    increased slightly from 2009 to reflect more favorable market
    conditions as the effects of the economic recession have
    lessened. In general, our selected EBITDA multiples used at
    December 31, 2010 are consistent with those used at
    December 31, 2009.

As stated previously, cash flows are derived from budgeted
    amounts and operating forecasts that have been evaluated by
    management. In connection with the 2010 assessment, projected
    growth rates by reporting unit varied widely with ranges from 0%
    to 36% for operating units in the electric power and the natural
    gas and pipeline divisions, 0% to 57% for operating units in
    telecommunications and 0% to 34% for the operating unit in fiber
    optic licensing.

Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and
    our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized.
    Changes in our judgments and projections could result in a
    significantly different estimate of the fair value of reporting
    units and intangible assets and could result in an impairment.
    Variances in the assessment of market conditions, projected cash
    flows, cost of capital, growth rates and acquisition multiples
    applied could have an impact on the assessment of impairments
    and any amount of goodwill impairment charges recorded. For
    example, lower growth rates, lower acquisition multiples or
    higher costs of capital assumptions would all individually lead
    to lower fair value assessments and potentially increased
    frequency or size of goodwill impairments. Any goodwill or other
    intangible impairment would be included in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

Based on the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis, we
    determined that, as of December 31, 2010, the fair value of
    each reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value. We
    considered the sensitivity of these fair value estimates to
    changes in certain of management’s assumptions, and after
    giving consideration to at least a 10% decrease in the fair
    value of each of our reporting units, the results of our
    assessment would not have changed. Additionally, we compared the
    sum of fair values of our reporting units to our market
    capitalization at December 31, 2010 and determined that the
    excess of the aggregate fair value of all reporting units to our
    market capitalization reflected a reasonable control premium.
    Our market capitalization at December 31, 2010 was
    approximately $4.28 billion, and our total equity was
    approximately $3.37 billion. Accordingly, we determined
    that there was no goodwill impairment at December 31, 2010.
    Increases in the carrying value of individual reporting units
    that may be indicated by our impairment tests are not recorded,
    therefore we may record goodwill impairments in the future, even
    when the aggregate fair value of our reporting units as a whole
    may increase.

We and our customers continue to operate in a challenging
    business environment, with increasing regulatory requirements
    and only gradual recovery in the economy and capital markets
    from recessionary levels. We are closely monitoring our
    customers and the effect that changes in economic and market
    conditions have had or may have on them. Certain of our
    customers have reduced spending in the past two years, which we
    attribute to the negative economic and market conditions, and we
    anticipate that these negative conditions may continue to affect
    demand for some of our services in the near-term. We continue to
    evaluate the impact of the economic environment on our reporting
    units and the valuation of recorded goodwill. Although we are
    not aware of circumstances that would lead to a goodwill
    impairment at a reporting unit currently, circumstances such as
    a continued market decline, the loss of a major customer or
    other factors could impact the valuation of goodwill in the
    future.

Our goodwill is included in multiple reporting units. Due to the
    cyclical nature of our business, and the other factors described
    under

“Risk Factors”

in Item 1A, the
    profitability of our individual reporting units may suffer from
    downturns in customer demand and other factors. These factors
    may have a disproportionate impact on the individual reporting
    units as compared to Quanta as a whole and might adversely
    affect such fair value of individual reporting units. If
    material adverse conditions occur that impact our reporting
    units, our future estimates of fair value may not support the
    carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units, and the
    related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount
    considered recoverable.

Valuation of Other Intangibles.

Our intangible
    assets include customer relationships, backlog, trade names,
    non-compete agreements and patented rights and developed
    technology. The value of customer relationships is estimated
    using the

value-in-use

concept utilizing the income approach, specifically the excess
    earnings method. The excess earnings analysis consists of
    discounting to present value the projected cash flows
    attributable to the customer relationships, with consideration
    given to customer contract renewals, the importance or lack
    thereof of


existing customer relationships to our business plan, income
    taxes and required rates of return. We value backlog based upon
    the contractual nature of the backlog within each service line,
    using the income approach to discount back to present value the
    cash flows attributable to the backlog. The value of trade names
    is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method of the income
    approach. This approach is based on the assumption that in lieu
    of ownership, a company would be willing to pay a royalty in
    order to exploit the related benefits of this intangible asset.

We amortize intangible assets based upon the estimated
    consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset or
    on a straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits
    consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated. Intangible
    assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment and
    are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
    recoverable. For instance, a significant change in business
    climate or a loss of a significant customer, among other things,
    may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of
    intangible assets. An impairment loss is recognized if the
    carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and
    its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets.

We review
    long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
    realizable. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future
    undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared
    to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if an
    impairment of such asset is necessary. This requires us to make
    long-term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to
    the assets subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions
    about demand for our products and future market conditions.
    Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and
    our projections may vary from the cash flows eventually
    realized. Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions
    could require a provision for impairment in a future period. The
    effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference
    between the fair value of such asset and its carrying value.
    Such expense would be reflected in income (loss) from operations
    in the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, we
    estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets and other
    intangibles and periodically review these estimates to determine
    whether these lives are appropriate.

Current and Non-Current Accounts and Notes Receivable and
    Provision for Doubtful Accounts.

We provide an
    allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account or
    note receivable is considered doubtful, and receivables are
    written off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible.
    Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful
    accounts are certain judgments and estimates including, among
    others, our customer’s access to capital, our
    customer’s willingness or ability to pay, general economic
    and market conditions and the ongoing relationship with the
    customer. Under certain circumstances such as foreclosures or
    negotiated settlements, we may take title to the underlying
    assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. Material
    changes in our customers’ business or cash flows, which may
    be further impacted by unfavorable economic and market
    conditions, could affect our ability to collect amounts due from
    them. Should customers experience financial difficulties or file
    for bankruptcy, or should anticipated recoveries relating to the
    receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations
    fail to materialize, we could experience reduced cash flows and
    losses in excess of current allowances provided.

Income Taxes.

We follow the liability method
    of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences
    of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax
    bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the
    enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect
    when the underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or
    settled.

We regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for
    deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain.
    The estimation of required valuation allowances includes
    estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of
    deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
    taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
    differences become deductible. We consider projected future
    taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
    assessment. If actual future taxable income differs from our
    estimates, we may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent
    estimated.

We record reserves for expected tax consequences of uncertain
    tax positions assuming that the taxing authorities have full
    knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The income tax
    laws and regulations are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As
    such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and
    judgments regarding our tax positions that could materially
    affect amounts recognized in our future consolidated balance
    sheets and statements of operations.


Outlook

We and our customers continue to operate in a difficult business
    environment, with only gradual improvements in the economy and
    continuing uncertainty in the marketplace. Our customers are
    also facing stringent regulatory requirements as they implement
    projects to enhance the overall state of their infrastructure,
    which has resulted in reductions or delays in spending in 2010.
    These economic and regulatory factors negatively affected our
    results in 2010. We believe, however, that economic conditions
    will continue to improve and market constraints will lessen,
    resulting in increased activity and spending in the industries
    we serve in 2011 and beyond, although the regulatory obstacles
    our customers must overcome create continuing uncertainty as to
    the timing of spending. We continue to be optimistic, however,
    about our long-term opportunities in each of the industries we
    serve, and we believe that our financial and operational
    strengths will enable us to manage the challenges and
    uncertainties created by the adverse economic and market
    conditions.

Electric
    Power Infrastructure Services Segment

The North American electric grid is aging and requires
    significant upgrades to meet future demands for power. Over the
    past several years, many utilities across the country have begun
    to implement plans to improve their transmission systems. As a
    result, new construction, structure change-outs, line upgrades
    and maintenance projects on many transmission systems are
    occurring or planned. Indications are that the long-awaited
    transmission build-out programs by our customers has begun. In
    the second half of 2010 and in early 2011, several large-scale
    transmission projects were awarded, which is indicative that
    transmission spending is beginning to increase. Regulatory
    processes remain a hurdle for some proposed transmission
    projects, continuing to cause delays and create uncertainty as
    to timing on some transmission spending. We anticipate, however,
    these hurdles to be overcome and transmission spending to
    accelerate over the next few years.

We also anticipate that utilities will continue to integrate
    “smart grid” technologies into their transmission and
    distribution systems to improve grid management and create
    efficiencies. Development and installation of smart grid
    technologies have benefited from stimulus funding and the desire
    by consumers for more efficient energy use. With respect to our
    electric power distribution services, we have seen a slowdown in
    spending by our customers over the past two years on their
    distribution systems, which we believe is due primarily to
    adverse economic and market conditions. Although we saw some
    increase in spending in the latter part of 2010, we expect
    distribution spending to remain at low levels into 2011. As an
    indirect result of the prolonged economic downturn, overall
    growth in demand for electricity decreased, which could also
    affect the timing and scope of transmission and distribution
    spending by our customers on their existing systems or planned
    projects. We believe, however, that utilities remain committed
    to the expansion and strengthening of their transmission
    infrastructure, with planning, engineering and funding for many
    of their projects in place, and to date, we have not seen the
    current economic conditions negatively impact our
    customers’ plans for spending on transmission expansion,
    with demand for electricity and the need for reliability
    expected to increase over the long-term. As a result of these
    and other factors, including the renewable energy initiatives
    discussed below, we anticipate a continued shift over the
    long-term in our electric power service mix to a greater
    proportion of high-voltage electric power transmission and
    substation projects. Many of these projects have a long-term
    horizon, and timing and scope can be affected by numerous
    factors, including regulatory permitting, siting and

right-of-way

issues, environmental approvals and economic and market
    conditions.

We believe that opportunities also exist as a result of
    renewable energy initiatives. We saw an increase in renewable
    energy spending in 2010, and we expect future spending on
    renewable energy initiatives to continue to increase,
    particularly in connection with solar power, in 2011 and beyond.
    State renewable portfolio standards, which set required or
    voluntary standards for how much power is required to be
    generated from renewable energy sources, as well as general
    environmental concerns, are driving the development of renewable
    energy projects, with a stronger focus currently on
    utility-scale and distributed solar projects. Tax incentives and
    government stimulus funds are also expected to encourage
    development. We expect the construction of renewable energy
    facilities, including solar power and wind generation sources,
    to result in the need for additional transmission lines and
    substations to transport the power from the facilities, which
    are often in remote locations, to demand centers. We also
    believe opportunities exist for us to provide engineering,
    project management, materials procurement and installation
    services for renewable projects, as reflected by recent awards
    to us of contracts for these services on


various utility-scale solar facilities. However, the economic
    feasibility of renewable energy projects, and therefore the
    attractiveness of investment in the projects, may depend on the
    availability of tax incentive programs or the ability of the
    projects to take advantage of such incentives, and there is no
    assurance that the government will extend existing tax
    incentives or create new incentive or funding programs. The
    timing of investments in renewable energy projects and related
    infrastructure could also be affected by regulatory permitting
    processes and siting issues, as well as capital constraints if
    the financial markets deteriorate. Furthermore, to the extent
    that renewable energy projects are developed to satisfy
    mandatory state renewable portfolio standards, spending on such
    projects would likely decline if states were to lessen those
    standards.

We believe that certain provisions of the American Recovery and
    Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), enacted in February 2009, will
    also increase demand for our services in 2011 and beyond. The
    economic stimulus programs under the ARRA include incentives in
    the form of grants, loans, tax cuts and tax incentives for
    renewable energy, energy efficiency and electric power and
    telecommunications infrastructure. Additionally, loan guarantee
    programs partially funded through the ARRA and cash grant
    programs have been implemented for renewable energy and
    transmission reliability and efficiency projects. For example,
    in October 2009, approximately $3.4 billion in cash grants
    were awarded to foster the transition to a “smarter”
    electric grid. We anticipate investments in many of these
    initiatives to create opportunities for our operations, although
    many projects are waiting on regulatory approval. While we
    cannot predict with certainty the timing of the implementation
    of the programs under the ARRA, the funding of stimulus projects
    or the scope of projects once funding is received, we anticipate
    projects to have aggressive deployment schedules due to the
    deadlines under the stimulus plan, resulting in increased
    opportunities in the near term.

Several existing, pending or proposed legislative or regulatory
    actions may also positively affect demand for the services
    provided by this segment in the long-term, in particular in
    connection with electric power infrastructure and renewable
    energy spending. For example, legislative or regulatory action
    that alleviates some of the siting and

right-of-way

challenges that impact transmission projects would potentially
    accelerate future transmission projects. We also anticipate
    increased infrastructure spending by our customers as a result
    of legislation requiring the power industry to meet federal
    reliability standards for its transmission and distribution
    systems and providing further incentives to the industry to
    invest in and improve maintenance on its systems. Additionally,
    the proposed federal renewable portfolio standard could further
    advance the installation of renewable generation facilities and
    related electric transmission infrastructure. It is uncertain,
    however, if or when pending or proposed legislation or
    regulations will be effective or whether the potentially
    beneficial provisions we highlight in this outlook will be
    included in the final legislation, and this uncertainty could
    affect our customers’ decisions regarding potential
    projects and the timing thereof.

Several industry and market trends are also prompting customers
    in the electric power industry to seek outsourcing partners.
    These trends include an aging utility workforce, increasing
    costs and labor issues. The need to ensure available labor
    resources for larger projects is also driving strategic
    relationships with customers.

Natural
    Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services Segment

We also see potential growth opportunities over the long-term in
    our natural gas and pipeline operations, primarily in natural
    gas and oil pipeline installation and maintenance and related
    services such as gas gathering and pipeline integrity. We
    believe our position as a leading provider of transmission
    pipeline infrastructure services in North America will allow us
    to take advantage of these opportunities. However, the natural
    gas and oil industry is cyclical as a result of fluctuations in
    natural gas and oil prices, and spending in this industry has
    been negatively impacted in the past by lower natural gas and
    oil prices, a reduction in the development of resources,
    regulatory permitting processes and capital constraints. We
    believe that the cyclical nature of this business can be
    somewhat normalized by opportunities associated with an increase
    in the ongoing development of unconventional shale formations
    that produce natural gas

and/or

oil,
    as well as the development of Canadian oil sands, requiring the
    construction of transmission pipeline infrastructure to connect
    production with demand centers. Additionally, we believe the
    goals of clean energy and energy independence for the United
    States and Canada will make abundant, low-cost natural gas the
    fuel of choice to replace coal for power generation until
    renewable energy becomes a significant part of the overall
    generation of electricity, creating the demand for additional
    production of natural gas and the need for related
    infrastructure. The U.S. Department of Transportation has
    also implemented significant regulatory legislation through the
    Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration relating
    to pipeline


integrity requirements that we expect will increase the demand
    for our pipeline integrity and rehabilitation services over the
    long-term. In the past, our natural gas operations have been
    challenged by lower margins overall, due in part to the impact
    to our natural gas distribution services from declines in new
    housing construction. As a result, we have primarily focused our
    efforts in this segment on transmission pipeline opportunities
    and other more profitable services, and we are optimistic about
    these operations in the future. The timing and scope of projects
    could be affected, however, by economic and market conditions as
    well as lower natural gas and oil prices and regulatory
    requirements, especially in the near-term. Our specific
    opportunities in the transmission pipeline business are
    sometimes difficult to predict because of the seasonality of the
    bidding and construction cycles within the industry. Projects
    are often bid and awarded in the first part of the year, with
    construction activities compressed in the third and fourth
    quarters of the year. As a result, we often are limited in our
    ability to determine the outlook, including backlog, for this
    business until we near the close of the bidding cycle.

Telecommunications
    Infrastructure Services Segment

In connection with our telecommunications services, we expect
    increasing opportunities in the future as stimulus funding for
    broadband deployment to underserved areas progresses through the
    engineering phase into construction. Approximately
    $7.2 billion in funding has been awarded under the ARRA for
    numerous broadband deployment projects across the
    U.S. However, to receive funding for these projects,
    awardees are generally required to file environmental impact
    statements, the approval of which has delayed and may continue
    to delay projects. If funding is delayed, the demand for our
    telecommunications services will be affected. Although the
    timing of funding is uncertain, once funding is received,
    projects are expected to be rapidly deployed to meet stimulus
    deadlines that require completion of the project within three
    years, which for many projects will extend through 2013. As a
    result, we anticipate this deployment schedule will increase
    spending over the next three years. We also anticipate spending
    by our customers on fiber optic “backhaul” to provide
    links from wireless cell sites to broader voice, data and video
    networks. In connection with our wireless services, several
    wireless companies have announced plans to increase their cell
    site deployments over the next few years, including the
    expansion of next generation technology. In particular, the
    transition to 4G and LTE (long term evolution) technology by
    wireless service providers will require the enhancement of their
    networks. We also believe opportunities remain over the
    long-term as a result of fiber build-out initiatives by wireline
    carriers and government organizations, although we do not expect
    spending for these initiatives to increase significantly over
    the levels experienced in the past two years. We anticipate that
    the opportunities in both wireline and wireless businesses will
    increase demand for our telecommunications services over the
    long-term, with the timing and amount of spending from these
    opportunities being dependent on future economic, market and
    regulatory conditions.

Fiber
    Optic Licensing Segment

Our Fiber Optic Licensing segment is experiencing growth
    primarily through geographic expansion, with a focus on markets
    where secure high-speed networks are important, such as markets
    where enterprises, communications carriers and educational,
    financial services and healthcare institutions are prevalent. We
    continue to see opportunities for growth both in the markets we
    currently serve and new markets, although we cannot predict the
    adverse impact, if any, of economic conditions on these growth
    opportunities. To support the growth in this business, we
    anticipate the need for continued capital expenditures. This
    growth, however, has been affected in the education markets,
    which has in the past comprised a significant portion of this
    segment’s revenues. We believe this slow down is due to
    budgetary constraints that will continue to affect this
    segment’s customers in the near term. Our Fiber Optic
    Licensing segment typically generates higher margins than our
    other operations, but we can give no assurance that the Fiber
    Optic Licensing segment margins will continue at historical
    levels.

Conclusion

Spending by our customers declined in 2009 and remained slow
    throughout 2010; however, we are seeing growth opportunities
    beginning in 2011 in our electric transmission, gas
    transmission, telecommunications, renewables and fiber licensing
    operations despite negative effects from the economic recession
    and heightened regulatory requirements. We expect spending on
    electric distribution and gas distribution services, both of
    which have been more significantly affected by the economic
    conditions that have existed during the past two years, to
    remain slow in the near term. The weakness in the capital
    markets has also negatively affected some of our


customers’ plans for projects, and it may continue to do so
    in the future, which could delay, reduce or suspend future
    projects if funding is not available. However, we do not believe
    these factors are material or will significantly affect revenue
    growth in 2011 and beyond. We anticipate that utilities will
    increase spending on projects to upgrade and build out their
    transmission systems and outsource more of their work, due in
    part to their aging workforce issues. We believe that we remain
    the partner of choice for many utilities in need of broad
    infrastructure expertise, specialty equipment and workforce
    resources. We also believe that we are one of the largest
    full-service solution providers of natural gas transmission and
    distribution services in North America, which positions us to
    leverage opportunities in the natural gas industry. Furthermore,
    as new technologies emerge in the future for communications and
    digital services such as voice, video and data,
    telecommunications and cable service providers are expected to
    work quickly to deploy fast, next-generation fiber and wireless
    networks, and we are recognized as a key partner in deploying
    these services.

We also expect to continue to see our margins generally improve
    over the long-term, although reductions in spending by our
    customers and competitive pricing environments negatively
    impacted our margins during 2010 and could further affect our
    margins in the future. Additionally, margins may be negatively
    impacted on a quarterly basis due to adverse weather conditions,
    timing of projects and other factors as described in

“Understanding Margins”

above. We continue to
    focus on the elements of the business we can control, including
    costs, the margins we accept on projects, collecting
    receivables, ensuring quality service and rightsizing
    initiatives to match the markets we serve.

Capital expenditures for 2011 are expected to be between $180
    million to $210 million, of which approximately $30 million
    to $35 million of these expenditures are targeted for fiber
    optic network expansion with the majority of the remaining
    expenditures for operating equipment. We expect 2011 capital
    expenditures to continue to be funded substantially through
    internal cash flows and cash on hand.

We continue to evaluate other potential strategic acquisitions
    or investments to broaden our customer base, expand our
    geographic area of operation and grow our portfolio of services.
    We believe that additional attractive acquisition candidates
    exist primarily as a result of the highly fragmented nature of
    the industry, the inability of many companies to expand and
    modernize due to capital constraints and the desire of owners
    for liquidity. We also believe that our financial strength and
    experienced management team will be attractive to acquisition
    candidates.

We believe certain international regions also present
    significant opportunities for growth across many of our
    operations. We are strategically evaluating ways in which we can
    apply our expertise to strengthen the infrastructure in various
    foreign countries where infrastructure enhancements are
    increasingly important. For example, we are actively pursuing
    opportunities in growth markets where we can leverage our
    technology or proprietary work methods, such as our energized
    services, to establish a presence in these markets.

We believe that we are adequately positioned to capitalize upon
    opportunities and trends in the industries we serve because of
    our proven full-service operations with broad geographic reach,
    financial capability and technical expertise. Additionally, we
    believe that these industry opportunities and trends will
    increase the demand for our services over the long-term;
    however, we cannot predict the actual timing, magnitude or
    impact these opportunities and trends will have on our operating
    results and financial position.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our primary exposure to market risk relates to unfavorable
    changes in concentration of credit risk, interest rates and
    currency exchange rates.

Credit Risk.

We are subject to concentrations
    of credit risk related primarily to our cash and cash
    equivalents and our accounts receivable, including amounts
    related to unbilled accounts receivable and costs and estimated
    earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts.
    Substantially all of our cash investments are managed by what we
    believe to be high credit quality financial institutions. In
    accordance with our investment policies, these institutions are
    authorized to invest this cash in a diversified portfolio of
    what we believe to be high-quality investments, which primarily
    include interest-bearing demand deposits, money market mutual
    funds and investment grade commercial paper with original
    maturities of three months or less. Although we do not currently
    believe the principal amounts of these investments are subject
    to any material risk of loss, the weakness in the economy has
    significantly impacted the interest income we receive from these
    investments and is likely to continue to do so in the future. In
    addition, as we grant credit under normal payment terms,
    generally with collateral, we are subject to potential credit
    risk related to our customers’ ability to pay for services
    provided. This risk may be heightened as a result of the
    depressed economic and financial market conditions that have
    existed over the past two years. However, we believe the
    concentration of credit risk related to trade accounts
    receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of
    billings on uncompleted contracts is limited because of the
    diversity of our customers. We perform ongoing credit risk
    assessments of our customers and financial institutions and
    obtain collateral or other security from our customers when
    appropriate.

Interest Rate and Market Risk.

Currently, we
    do not have any significant assets or obligations with exposure
    to significant interest rate and market risk.

Currency Risk.

In the third quarter of 2009,
    one of our Canadian operating units entered into three forward
    contracts with settlement dates in 2009 and 2010, to reduce
    foreign currency risk associated with anticipated customer sales
    that were denominated in South African rand. This same operating
    unit also entered into three additional forward contracts with
    the same settlement dates to reduce the foreign currency
    exposure associated with a series of forecasted intercompany
    payments denominated in U.S. dollars to be made over a
    twelve-month period. These contracts were accounted for as cash
    flow hedges. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the
    forward contracts were recorded in other comprehensive income
    (loss) prior to their settlement and were reclassified into
    earnings in the periods in which the hedged transactions
    occurred.

The South African rand to Canadian dollar forward contracts had
    an aggregate notional amount of approximately $11.0 million
    ($CAD) at origination, and the Canadian dollar to
    U.S. Dollar forward contracts had an aggregate notional
    amount of approximately $9.5 million (U.S.) at origination.
    During the year ended December 31, 2010, net losses of
    $0.4 million were recorded in income in connection with the
    settled contracts. There were no forward contracts outstanding
    at December 31, 2010, and as a result, there is no balance
    related to the forward contracts in other comprehensive income.
    During the year ended December 31, 2009, losses of
    $0.8 million were recorded in income in connection with the
    settled contracts, and at December 31, 2009, there was
    $0.4 million in other comprehensive income (loss) related
    to the forward contracts.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT

Management’s
    Report on Financial Information and Procedures

The accompanying financial statements of Quanta Services, Inc.
    and its subsidiaries were prepared by management. These
    financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States, applying
    certain estimates and judgments as required.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or
    detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
    well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
    absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives
    will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the
    fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
    controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further,
    because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
    evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
    misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all
    control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
    company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
    the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
    and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or
    mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual
    acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
    management override of the controls. The design of any system of
    controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the
    likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
    any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
    potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in
    the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control
    over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal
    control over financial reporting includes those policies and
    procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
    that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
    (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based upon the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2010 to provide reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation of financial statements for external reporting
    purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal
    control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
    assurances and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

The effectiveness of Quanta Services, Inc.’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010
    has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which
    appears herein.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010 excluded the acquisition we completed on
    October 25, 2010. Such exclusion was in accordance with SEC
    guidance that an assessment of recently acquired businesses may
    be omitted in management’s report on internal control over
    financial reporting, provided the acquisition took place within
    twelve months of management’s evaluation. This acquisition
    comprised approximately 6% of our consolidated assets at
    December 31, 2010 and less than 1% of our consolidated
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010.


REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Quanta Services,
    Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, of cash flows
    and equity, present fairly, in all material respects, the
    financial position of Quanta Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
    on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded its 2010
    acquisition from its assessment of internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 because this
    acquisition was acquired by the Company through a purchase
    business combination on October 25, 2010. We have also
    excluded the Company’s 2010 acquisition from our audit of
    internal control over financial reporting. The 2010 acquisition
    of the Company and its related subsidiaries are wholly owned
    subsidiaries of the Company and have total assets and revenues
    which represent approximately 6% and less than 1%,
    respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement
    amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Acquisitions

On October 25, 2010, Quanta acquired Valard Construction LP
    and certain of its affiliated entities (Valard), an electric
    power infrastructure services company based in Alberta, Canada.
    In connection with the acquisition, Quanta paid the former
    owners of Valard approximately $118.9 million in cash and
    issued 623,720 shares of Quanta common stock and 3,909,110
    exchangeable shares of a Canadian subsidiary of Quanta. In
    addition, one share of Quanta Series F preferred stock with
    voting rights equivalent to Quanta common stock equal to the
    number of exchangeable shares outstanding at any time was issued
    to a voting trust on behalf of the holders of the exchangeable
    shares. The aggregate value of the common stock and exchangeable
    shares issued was approximately $88.5 million. The
    exchangeable shares are substantially equivalent to, and
    exchangeable on a

one-for-one

basis for, Quanta common stock. In connection with the
    acquisition, Quanta also repaid $12.8 million in Valard
    debt at the closing of the acquisition. As this transaction was
    effective October 25, 2010, the results of Valard have been
    included in the consolidated financial statements beginning on
    such date. This acquisition allows Quanta to further expand its
    capabilities and scope of services in Canada. Valard’s
    financial results will generally be included in Quanta’s
    Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.

On October 1, 2009, Quanta acquired Price Gregory Services,
    Incorporated (Price Gregory). In connection with the
    acquisition, Quanta issued approximately 10.9 million
    shares of Quanta common stock valued at approximately
    $231.8 million and paid approximately $95.8 million in
    cash to the stockholders of Price Gregory. As the transaction
    was effective October 1, 2009, the results of Price Gregory
    have been included in the consolidated financial statements
    beginning on such date. Price Gregory provides natural gas and
    oil transmission pipeline infrastructure services in North
    America, specializing in the construction of large diameter
    transmission pipelines. Price Gregory’s financial results
    are generally included in Quanta’s Natural Gas and Pipeline
    Infrastructure Services segment.

At various times during 2009, Quanta acquired three other
    businesses for an aggregate consideration of $36.0 million,

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Quanta include the
    accounts of Quanta Services, Inc. and its wholly owned
    subsidiaries, which are also referred to as its operating units.
    The consolidated financial statements also include the accounts
    of certain of Quanta’s investments in joint ventures, which
    are either consolidated or partially consolidated, as discussed
    in following summary of significant accounting policies. All
    significant intercompany


QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
    Unless the context requires otherwise, references to Quanta
    include Quanta and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Use of
    Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management in
    determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist
    as of the date the financial statements are published and the
    reported amount of revenues and expenses recognized during the
    periods presented. Quanta reviews all significant estimates
    affecting its consolidated financial statements on a recurring
    basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior
    to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on
    Quanta’s beliefs and assumptions derived from information
    available at the time such judgments and estimates are made.
    Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are
    inherent in the preparation of financial statements. Estimates
    are primarily used in Quanta’s assessment of the allowance
    for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, capitalization of
    internally produced assets, useful lives of assets, fair value
    assumptions in analyzing goodwill, other intangibles and
    long-lived asset impairments, valuation of derivative contracts,
    purchase price allocations, liabilities for self-insured claims,
    convertible debt, revenue recognition for construction contracts
    and fiber optic licensing, share-based compensation, operating
    results of reportable segments, provision for income taxes and
    the calculation of uncertain tax positions.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Quanta had cash and cash equivalents of $539.2 million and
    $699.6 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Cash
    consisting of interest-bearing demand deposits is carried at
    cost, which approximates fair value. Quanta considers all highly
    liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three
    months or less to be cash equivalents, which are carried at fair
    value. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, cash equivalents were
    $460.8 million and $636.8 million, which consisted
    primarily of money market mutual funds and investment grade
    commercial paper and are discussed further in

“Fair
    Value Measurements”

below. As of December 31, 2010
    and 2009, cash and cash equivalents held in domestic bank
    accounts were approximately $509.6 million and
    $669.8 million and cash and cash equivalents held in
    foreign bank accounts were approximately $29.6 million and
    $29.8 million.

Current
    and Long-Term Accounts and Notes Receivable and Allowance for
    Doubtful Accounts

Quanta provides an allowance for doubtful accounts when
    collection of an account or note receivable is considered
    doubtful, and receivables are written off against the allowance
    when deemed uncollectible. Inherent in the assessment of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and
    estimates including, among others, the customer’s access to
    capital, the customer’s willingness or ability to pay,
    general economic and market conditions and the ongoing
    relationship with the customer. Quanta considers accounts
    receivable delinquent after 30 days but does not generally
    include delinquent accounts in its analysis of the allowance for
    doubtful accounts unless the accounts receivable have been
    outstanding for 90 days. In addition to balances that have
    been outstanding for 90 days, Quanta also includes accounts
    receivable in its analysis of the allowance for doubtful
    accounts if they relate to customers in bankruptcy or with other
    known difficulties. Under certain circumstances such as
    foreclosures or negotiated settlements, Quanta may take title to
    the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of
    receivables. Material changes in Quanta’s customers’
    business or cash flows, which may be impacted by negative
    economic and market conditions, could affect its ability to
    collect amounts due from them. As of December 31, 2010 and
    2009, Quanta had total allowances for doubtful accounts of
    approximately $7.3 million and $9.1 million of which,
    approximately $6.1 million and $8.1 million were
    included as a reduction of net current accounts receivable.
    Should customers experience financial difficulties or file for
    bankruptcy, or should anticipated recoveries relating to
    receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations
    fail to materialize, Quanta could experience reduced cash flows
    and losses in excess of current allowances provided.


QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The balances billed but not paid by customers pursuant to
    retainage provisions in certain contracts will be due upon
    completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer.
    Based on Quanta’s experience with similar contracts in
    recent years, the majority of the retainage balances at each
    balance sheet date will be collected within the next twelve
    months. Current retainage balances as of December 31, 2010
    and 2009 were approximately $119.4 million and
    $152.1 million and are included in accounts receivable.
    Retainage balances with settlement dates beyond the next twelve
    months are included in other assets, net, and as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $8.0 million and
    $2.4 million.

Within accounts receivable, Quanta recognizes unbilled
    receivables in circumstances such as when: revenues have been
    earned and recorded but the amount cannot be billed under the
    terms of the contract until a later date; costs have been
    incurred but are yet to be billed under cost-reimbursement type
    contracts; or amounts arise from routine lags in billing (for
    example, work completed one month but not billed until the next
    month). These balances do not include revenues accrued for work
    performed under fixed-price contracts as these amounts are
    recorded as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings
    on uncompleted contracts. At December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    the balances of unbilled receivables included in accounts
    receivable were approximately $103.5 million and
    $96.9 million.

Inventories

Inventories consist primarily of parts and supplies held for use
    in the ordinary course of business, which are valued by Quanta
    at the lower of cost or market as determined by using either the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method or the average costing method.
    Inventories also include certain job specific materials not yet
    installed which are valued using the specific identification
    method.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is
    computed using the straight-line method, net of estimated
    salvage values, over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
    Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the
    lesser of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of
    the asset. Depreciation expense related to property and
    equipment was approximately $107.5 million,
    $86.9 million and $77.7 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Quanta capitalizes costs associated with internally developed or
    constructed assets primarily associated with fiber optic
    licensing networks and software systems for internal
    applications. Capitalized costs include external direct costs of
    materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining
    internal-use assets, as well as payroll and payroll-related
    expenses for employees who are directly associated with and
    devote time to placing the assets into service. Capitalization
    of such costs are recorded to construction work in process
    beginning when the preliminary project stage is complete and
    ceases no later than the point at which the project is
    substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose at
    which point in time the asset is placed into service. As of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately
    $11.3 million and $19.8 million related to fiber optic
    licensing networks and $5.5 million and $10.8 million
    associated with internally developed software systems were
    recorded in construction work in process. Those capitalized
    costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the economic
    useful life of the asset, beginning when the asset is ready for
    its intended use. Capitalized costs are included in property and
    equipment on the consolidated balance sheets.

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
    when incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments,
    which extend the useful lives of existing equipment, are
    capitalized and depreciated over the adjusted remaining useful
    life of the assets. Upon retirement or disposition of property
    and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are
    removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is
    reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount may not be realizable. If an evaluation is required, fair
    value would be determined by estimating the future undiscounted
    cash flows associated with the asset and comparing it to the
    asset’s carrying


QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary.
    The effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference
    between the fair value of such asset and its carrying value in
    the period incurred.

During 2010 and 2009, approximately $8.2 million and
    $7.8 million in net property and equipment was reclassified
    to prepaid expenses and other current assets as they were deemed
    to be assets held for sale. In conjunction with this assessment,
    approximately $0.1 million and $4.5 million in net
    losses from the impairment of assets held for sale were included
    in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 and 2009.

Other
    Assets, Net

Other assets, net consists primarily of debt issuance costs,
    long term receivables, non-current inventory, refundable
    security deposits for leased properties and insurance claims in
    excess of deductibles that are due from Quanta’s insurers.

Debt
    Issuance Costs

Capitalized debt issuance costs related to Quanta’s credit
    facility and any other debt outstanding at a given balance sheet
    date are included in other assets, net and are amortized into
    interest expense on a straight-line basis over the terms of the
    respective agreements giving rise to the debt issuance costs,
    which Quanta believes approximates the effective interest rate
    method. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, capitalized debt
    issuance costs were $2.9 million and $6.0 million,
    with accumulated amortization of $2.1 million and
    $3.2 million. For the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, amortization expense related to capitalized debt
    issuance costs was $0.6 million, $0.9 million and
    $1.9 million, respectively. See Note 8 regarding the
    write-off of deferred financing costs in 2010.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangibles

Quanta has recorded goodwill in connection with its
    acquisitions. Goodwill is subject to an annual assessment for
    impairment using a two-step fair value-based test, which Quanta
    performs at the operating unit level. Each of Quanta’s
    operating units is organized into one of three internal
    divisions, which are closely aligned with Quanta’s
    reportable segments, based on the predominant type of work
    performed by the operating unit at the point in time the
    divisional designation is made. Because separate measures of
    assets and cash flows are not produced or utilized by management
    to evaluate segment performance, Quanta’s impairment
    assessments of its goodwill do not include any consideration of
    assets and cash flows by reportable segment. As a result, Quanta
    has determined that its individual operating units represent its
    reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill
    impairments.

Quanta’s goodwill impairment assessment is performed
    annually at year-end, or more frequently if events or
    circumstances exist which indicate that goodwill may be
    impaired. For instance, a decrease in Quanta’s market
    capitalization below book value, a significant change in
    business climate or a loss of a significant customer, among
    other things, may trigger the need for interim impairment
    testing of goodwill associated with one or all of its reporting
    units. The first step of the two-step fair value-based test
    involves comparing the fair value of each of Quanta’s
    reporting units with its carrying value, including goodwill. If
    the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
    the second step is performed. The second step compares the
    carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the
    implied fair value of its goodwill. If the implied fair value of
    goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss
    would be recorded as a reduction to goodwill with a
    corresponding charge to operating expense.

Quanta determines the fair value of its reporting units using a
    weighted combination of the discounted cash flow, market
    multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches, with
    heavier weighting on the discounted cash flow method, as in
    management’s opinion, this method currently results in the
    most accurate calculation of a reporting unit’s fair value.
    Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment
    and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such
    estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates,
    operating margins,


QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

discount rates, weighted average costs of capital and future
    market conditions, among others. Quanta believes the estimates
    and assumptions used in its impairment assessments are
    reasonable and based on available market information, but
    variations in any of the assumptions could result in materially
    different calculations of fair value and determinations of
    whether or not an impairment is indicated.

Under the discounted cash flow method, Quanta determines fair
    value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting
    unit, discounted to present value using risk-adjusted industry
    discount rates, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk
    of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor
    would expect to earn. Cash flows projections are derived from
    budgeted amounts and operating forecasts (typically a three-year
    model) plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which
    are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are
    developed for each reporting unit using growth rates that
    management believes are reasonably likely to occur along with a
    terminal value derived from the reporting unit’s earnings
    before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
    The EBITDA multiples for each reporting unit are based on
    trailing twelve-month comparable industry data.

Under the market multiple and market capitalization approaches,
    Quanta determines the estimated fair value of each of its
    reporting units by applying transaction multiples to each
    reporting unit’s projected EBITDA and then averaging that
    estimate with similar historical calculations using either a
    one, two or three year average. For the market capitalization
    approach, Quanta adds a reasonable control premium, which is
    estimated as the premium that would be received in a sale of the
    reporting unit in an orderly transaction between market
    participants.

The projected cash flows and estimated levels of EBITDA by
    reporting unit were used to determine fair value under the three
    approaches discussed herein. The following table presents the
    significant estimates used by management in determining the fair
    values of Quanta’s reporting units at December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008:

For recently acquired reporting units, a step one impairment
    test may not indicate an implied fair value that is
    substantially different from the reporting unit’s carrying
    value. Such similarities in value are generally an indication
    that management’s estimates of future cash flows associated
    with the recently acquired reporting unit remain relatively
    consistent with the assumptions that were used to derive its
    initial fair value. During the fourth quarter of 2010, a
    goodwill impairment analysis was performed for each of
    Quanta’s operating units, which indicated that the implied
    fair value of each of Quanta’s operating units was
    substantially in excess of carrying value. Following the
    analysis, management concluded that no impairment was indicated
    at any operating unit. As discussed generally above, when
    evaluating the 2010 step one impairment test results, management
    considered many factors in determining whether or not an
    impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit was reasonably
    likely to occur in future periods, including future market
    conditions and the economic environment in which Quanta’s
    reporting units were operating. Circumstances such as continued
    market declines, the loss of a major customer or other factors
    could impact the valuation of goodwill in future periods.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, a goodwill analysis was performed
    for each operating unit with estimates and industry comparables
    obtained from the electric power, natural gas and pipeline,
    telecommunications and fiber


QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

optic licensing industries, and no impairment was indicated. The

15-year

discounted cash flow model used for fiber optic licensing is
    based on the long-term nature of the underlying fiber network
    licensing agreements.

Quanta assigned a higher weighting to the discounted cash flow
    approach in all periods to reflect increased expectations of
    market value being determined from a “held and used”
    model. At December 31, 2009 Quanta decreased EBITDA
    multiples at operating units from 2008 to reflect potential
    declines in market conditions as a result of the continued
    effect of the economic recession which began in late 2008. At
    December 31, 2010, certain EBITDA multiples were increased
    slightly from 2009 to reflect more favorable market conditions
    as the effects of the economic recession have lessened. In
    general, Quanta’s selected EBITDA multiples used at
    December 31, 2010 are consistent with those used at
    December 31, 2009.

Quanta’s intangible assets include customer relationships,
    backlog, trade names, non-compete agreements and patented rights
    and developed technology. The value of customer relationships is
    estimated using the

value-in-use

concept utilizing the income approach, specifically the excess
    earnings method. The excess earnings analysis consists of
    discounting to present value the projected cash flows
    attributable to the customer relationships, with consideration
    given to customer contract renewals, the importance or lack
    thereof of existing customer relationships to Quanta’s
    business plan, income taxes and required rates of return. Quanta
    values backlog based upon the contractual nature of the backlog
    within each service line, using the income approach to discount
    back to present value the cash flows attributable to the
    backlog. The value of trade names is estimated using the
    relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. This approach
    is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company
    would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the
    related benefits of this intangible asset.

Quanta amortizes intangible assets based upon the estimated
    consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset or
    on a straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits
    consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated. Intangible
    assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment and
    are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
    recoverable. For instance, a significant change in business
    climate or a loss of a significant customer, among other things,
    may trigger the need for impairment testing of intangible
    assets. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount
    of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying
    amount exceeds its fair value.

Investments
    in Joint Ventures

In the normal course of business, Quanta enters into various
    types of joint venture agreements, each having unique terms and
    conditions, with Quanta owning an equity interest in either an
    incorporated or an unincorporated company as a result. Quanta
    determines whether a joint venture is a variable interest entity
    (VIE) based on the characteristics of the entity involved. If
    the entity is determined to be a VIE, then management determines
    if Quanta is the primary beneficiary and whether or not
    consolidation of the VIE is required. The primary beneficiary
    consolidating the VIE must normally meet both of the following
    characteristics: (i) the power to direct the activities of
    a VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic
    performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the
    VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the
    right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be
    significant to the VIE. When Quanta is deemed to be the primary
    beneficiary, the other party’s equity interest in the joint
    venture is accounted for as a noncontrolling interest. In cases
    where Quanta determines it has an undivided interest in the
    assets, liabilities, revenues and profits of an unincorporated
    VIE (i.e., a general partnership interest), such amounts are
    consolidated on a basis proportional to Quanta’s ownership
    interest in the unincorporated entity.

and non-fixed price installation contracts. Pricing under
    contracts may be competitive unit price, cost-plus/hourly (or
    time and materials basis) or fixed price (or lump sum basis),
    and the final terms and prices of these contracts are frequently
    negotiated with the customer. Under unit-based contracts, the
    utilization of an output-based measurement is appropriate for
    revenue recognition. Under these contracts, Quanta recognizes
    revenue as units are completed based on pricing established
    between Quanta and the customer for each unit of delivery, which
    best reflects the pattern in which the obligation to the
    customer is fulfilled. Under cost-plus/ hourly and time and
    materials type contracts, Quanta recognizes revenue on an input
    basis, as labor hours are incurred and services are performed.

Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to
    total estimated costs for each contract. These contracts provide
    for a fixed amount of revenues for the entire project. Such
    contracts provide that the customer accept completion of
    progress to date and compensate Quanta for services rendered,
    which may be measured in terms of units installed, hours
    expended or some other measure of progress. Contract costs
    include all direct materials, labor and subcontract costs and
    those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as
    indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs.
    Much of the materials associated with Quanta’s work are
    owner-furnished and are therefore not included in contract
    revenues and costs. The cost estimation process is based on the
    professional knowledge and experience of Quanta’s
    engineers, project managers and financial professionals. Changes
    in job performance, job conditions and final contract
    settlements are factors that influence management’s
    assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs
    to complete those contracts and therefore, Quanta’s profit
    recognition. Changes in these factors may result in revisions to
    costs and income, and their effects are recognized in the period
    in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for losses on
    uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such
    losses are determined to be probable and the amount can be
    reasonably estimated.

Quanta may incur costs subject to change orders, whether
    approved or unapproved by the customer,

and/or

claims related to certain contracts. Quanta determines the
    probability that such costs will be recovered based upon
    evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific
    discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer or
    verbal approvals. Quanta treats items as a cost of contract
    performance in the period incurred if it is not probable that
    the costs will be recovered or will recognize revenue if it is
    probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be
    reliably estimated. As of December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009, Quanta had approximately
    $83.1 million and $26.1 million of change orders

and/or

claims that had been included as contract price adjustments on
    certain contracts which were in the process of being negotiated
    in the normal course of business.

The current asset “Costs and estimated earnings in excess
    of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents revenues
    recognized in excess of amounts billed for fixed price
    contracts. The current liability “Billings in excess of
    costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts”
    represents billings in excess of revenues recognized for fixed
    price contracts.

Fiber Optic Licensing

— The Fiber Optic
    Licensing segment constructs and licenses the right to use fiber
    optic telecommunications facilities to its customers pursuant to
    licensing agreements, typically with terms from five to
    twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal options. Under
    those agreements, customers are provided the right to use a
    portion of the capacity of a fiber optic facility, with the
    facility owned and maintained by Quanta. Revenues, including any
    initial fees or advance billings, are recognized ratably over
    the expected length of the agreements, including probable
    renewal periods. As of December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009, initial fees and advanced billings on
    these licensing agreements not yet recorded in revenue were
    $44.4 million and $35.9 million and are recognized as
    deferred revenue, with $34.7 million and $25.4 million
    considered to be long-term and

Income
    Taxes

Quanta follows the liability method of accounting for income
    taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are recorded for future tax consequences of temporary
    differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
    assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax
    rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the
    underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled.

Quanta regularly evaluates valuation allowances established for
    deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain.
    The estimation of required valuation allowances includes
    estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of
    deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
    taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
    differences become deductible. Quanta considers projected future
    taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
    assessment. If actual future taxable income differs from these
    estimates, Quanta may not realize deferred tax assets to the
    extent estimated.

Quanta records reserves for expected tax consequences of
    uncertain positions assuming that the taxing authorities have
    full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. As of
    December 31, 2010, the total amount of unrecognized tax
    benefits relating to uncertain tax positions was
    $50.6 million, an increase from December 31, 2009 of
    $5.4 million. This increase in unrecognized tax benefits
    results from a $10.6 million increase relating to the tax
    positions expected to be taken for 2010, a $10.3 million
    reduction due to the expiration of certain federal and state
    statutes of limitations for the 2006 tax year and a
    $5.1 million increase primarily related to foreign tax
    credits. Quanta recognized $2.2 million and
    $3.6 million of interest income and $4.8 million of
    interest expense and penalties in the provision for income taxes
    for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
    Quanta believes that it is reasonably possible that within the
    next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up
    to $8.8 million due to the expiration of certain statutes
    of limitations.

The income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and often
    ambiguous. As such, Quanta is required to make many subjective
    assumptions and judgments regarding its tax positions that could
    materially affect amounts recognized in its future consolidated
    balance sheets and statements of operations.

Collective
    Bargaining Agreements

Certain of Quanta’s operating units are parties to various
    collective bargaining agreements with unions representing
    certain of their employees. The agreements require such
    operating units to pay specified wages and provide certain
    benefits to their union employees, including contributions to
    certain multi-employer pension plans


QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and employee benefit trusts. The collective bargaining
    agreements expire at various times and have typically been
    renegotiated and renewed on terms that are similar to the ones
    contained in the expiring agreements.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Quanta recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based
    compensation based on the fair value of the awards granted, net
    of estimated forfeitures, at the date of grant. Quanta
    calculates the fair value of stock options using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted
    stock awards is determined based on the number of shares granted
    and the closing price of Quanta’s common stock on the date
    of grant. An estimate of future forfeitures is required in
    determining the period expense. Quanta uses historical data to
    estimate the forfeiture rate; however, these estimates are
    subject to change and may impact the value that will ultimately
    be realized as compensation expense. The resulting compensation
    expense from discretionary awards is recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is
    generally the vesting period, while compensation expense from
    performance based awards is recognized using the graded vesting
    method over the requisite service period. The cash flows
    resulting from the tax deductions in excess of the compensation
    expense recognized for stock options and restricted stock
    (excess tax benefit) are classified as financing cash flows.

Functional
    Currency and Translation of Financial Statements

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the majority
    of Quanta’s operations. However, Quanta has foreign
    operating units in Canada, for which Quanta considers the
    Canadian dollar to be the functional currency. Generally, the
    currency in which the operating unit transacts a majority of its
    transactions, including billings, financing, payroll and other
    expenditures, would be considered the functional currency, but
    any dependency upon the parent company and the nature of the
    operating unit’s operations must also be considered. Under
    the relevant accounting guidance, the treatment of these
    translation gains or losses is dependent upon management’s
    determination of the functional currency of each operating unit,
    which involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and
    circumstances affecting the operating unit. In preparing the
    consolidated financial statements, Quanta translates the
    financial statements of its foreign operating units from their
    functional currency into U.S. dollars. Statements of
    operations and cash flows are translated at average monthly
    rates, while balance sheets are translated at the month-end
    exchange rates. The translation of the balance sheets at the
    month-end exchange rates results in translation gains or losses.
    If transactions are denominated in the operating units’
    functional currency, the translation gains and losses are
    included as a separate component of equity under the caption
    “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” If
    transactions are not denominated in the operating units’
    functional currency, the translation gains and losses are
    included within the statement of operations.

Derivatives

From time to time, Quanta enters into forward currency contracts
    that qualify as derivatives in order to hedge the risks
    associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
    related to certain forecasted foreign currency denominated
    transactions. Quanta does not enter into derivative transactions
    for speculative purposes; however, for accounting purposes,
    certain transactions may not meet the criteria for cash flow
    hedge accounting. For a hedge to qualify for cash flow hedge
    accounting treatment, a hedge must be documented at the
    inception of the contract, with the objective and strategy
    stated, along with an explicit description of the methodology
    used to assess hedge effectiveness. The dates (or periods) for
    the expected forecasted events and the nature of the exposure
    involved (including quantitative measures of the size of the
    exposure) must also be documented. At the inception of the hedge
    and on an ongoing basis, the hedge must be deemed to be
    “highly effective” at minimizing the risk of the
    identified exposure. Effectiveness measures relate the gains or
    losses of the derivative to changes in the cash flows associated
    with the hedged item, and the forecasted transaction must be
    probable of occurring.

For forward contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges, Quanta
    accounts for the change in fair value of the forward contracts
    directly in equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss). Any ineffective

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

portion of cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the
    period ineffectiveness occurs. For instance, if a forward
    contract is discontinued as a cash flow hedge because it is
    probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur
    by the end of the originally specified time period, the related
    amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would
    be reclassified to other income (expense) in the consolidated
    statement of operations in the period such determination is
    made. When a forecasted transaction occurs, the portion of the
    accumulated gain or loss applicable to the forecasted
    transaction is reclassified from equity to earnings. Changes in
    fair value related to transactions that do not meet the criteria
    for cash flow hedge accounting are recorded in the consolidated
    results of operations and are included in other income (expense).

Comprehensive
    Income

Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a
    period except those resulting from investments by and
    distributions to stockholders. As described above, Quanta
    records other comprehensive income, net of tax, for the foreign
    currency translation adjustment related to its foreign
    operations and for changes in fair value of its derivative
    contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges.

Litigation
    Costs and Reserves

Quanta records reserves when it is probable that a liability has
    been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably
    estimated. Costs incurred for litigation are expensed as
    incurred. Further details are presented in Note 14.

Fair
    Value Measurements

The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
    accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due
    to the short-term nature of those instruments. For disclosure
    purposes, qualifying assets and liabilities are categorized into
    three broad levels based on the priority of the inputs used to
    determine their fair values. The fair value hierarchy gives the
    highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the
    lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). All of
    Quanta’s cash equivalents are categorized as Level 1
    assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009, as all values are
    based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an
    active market that Quanta has the ability to access.

In connection with Quanta’s acquisitions, identifiable
    intangible assets acquired included goodwill, backlog, customer
    relationships, trade names and covenants

not-to-compete.

Quanta utilized the fair value premise as the primary basis for
    its valuation procedures, which is a market based approach to
    determining the price that would be received to sell an asset or
    paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
    market participants. Quanta periodically engaged the services of
    an independent valuation firm to assist management with this
    valuation process, which included assistance with the selection
    of appropriate valuation methodologies and the development of
    market-based valuation assumptions. Based on these
    considerations, management utilized various valuation methods,
    including an income approach, a market approach and a cost
    approach, to determine the fair value of intangible assets
    acquired based on the appropriateness of each method in relation
    to the type of asset being valued. The assumptions used in these
    valuation methods were analyzed and compared, where possible, to
    available market data, such as industry-based weighted average
    costs of capital and discount rates, trade name royalty rates,
    public company valuation multiples and recent market acquisition
    multiples. The level of inputs used for these fair value
    measurements is the lowest level (Level 3). Quanta believes
    that these valuation methods appropriately represent the methods
    that would be used by other market participants in determining
    fair value.

Quanta uses fair value measurements on a routine basis in its
    assessment of assets classified as goodwill, other intangible
    assets and long-lived assets held and used. In accordance with
    its annual impairment test during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of such assets,
    including goodwill, was compared to its fair value. No changes
    in carrying amount resulted. The inputs used for fair value
    measurements for goodwill, other


QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

intangible assets and long-lived assets held and used, are the
    lowest level (Level 3) inputs for which Quanta uses
    the assistance of third party specialists to develop valuation
    assumptions.

Quanta’s derivative liabilities at December 31, 2009,
    which are described in Note 10, were classified as
    Level 2 liabilities and had a total fair value on such date
    of $0.7 million. The fair values were determined based on
    adjusted broker quotes derived from open market pricing
    information. These derivative liabilities were included within
    accounts payable and accrued expenses in the December 31,
    2009 consolidated balance sheet. There were no derivatives
    outstanding at December 31, 2010.

Quanta’s 3.75% convertible subordinated notes (3.75% Notes)
    which were redeemed in full on May 14, 2010, were not
    required to be carried at fair value, although their fair market
    value was required to be disclosed. Prior to the redemption, the
    fair market value of Quanta’s 3.75% convertible
    subordinated notes due 2026 was subject to interest rate risk
    because of their fixed interest rate and market risk due to
    their convertible feature. The fair market value of
    Quanta’s 3.75% Notes was determined based upon the quoted
    secondary market price on or before the dates specified, which
    is considered a Level 2 input. The fair value of the
    aggregate outstanding principal amount of Quanta’s 3.75%
    Notes of $143.8 million was $160.8 million at
    December 31, 2009. None of the 3.75% Notes were outstanding
    at December 31, 2010.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

Adoption
    of New Accounting Pronouncements

On January 1, 2010, Quanta adopted new standards aimed to
    improve the visibility of off-balance sheet vehicles previously
    exempt from consolidation and address practice issues involving
    the accounting for transfers of financial assets as sales or
    secured borrowings. The impact from the adoption of these new
    standards was not material.

During the quarter ended December 31, 2010, Quanta adopted
    a new standard to improve disclosures related to finance
    receivables (defined as a contractual right to receive money, on
    demand or on fixed or determinable dates, that is recognized as
    an asset on the creditor’s balance sheet) and allowances
    for credit losses. The impact from the adoption of this new
    standard was not material.

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU

2010-29,

Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for
    Business Combinations

. The update requires the pro forma
    information for business combinations to be presented as if the
    business combination occurred at the beginning of the prior
    annual reporting period when calculating both the current
    reporting period and the prior reporting period pro forma
    financial information. The update also expands the supplemental
    pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and
    amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly
    attributable to the business combination. The amended guidance
    is effective prospectively for business combinations for which
    the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2010. Quanta adopted this update in the fourth quarter of 2010.
    The impact from this update was not material.

ACQUISITIONS:

    Acquisition

On October 25, 2010, Quanta acquired Valard. In connection
    with the acquisition, Quanta paid the former owners of
    Valard approximately $118.9 million in cash and issued
    623,720 shares of Quanta common stock, and 3,909,110
    exchangeable shares of a Canadian subsidiary of Quanta that are
    substantially equivalent to, and exchangeable on a

one-for-one

basis for, Quanta common stock. In addition, Quanta issued to a
    voting trust on behalf of the holders of the exchangeable shares
    one share of Quanta Series F preferred stock with voting
    rights equivalent to Quanta common stock equal to the number of
    exchangeable shares outstanding at any time. The aggregate value
    of the above issued securities on the closing date totaled
    approximately $88.5 million. In


QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

connection with the acquisition, Quanta also repaid
    $12.8 million in Valard debt at the closing of the
    acquisition. Valard provides electric power infrastructure
    services in Canada, expanding Quanta’s capabilities in the
    Canadian market. Valard’s results of operations have been
    included in Quanta’s consolidated results of operations
    since October 25, 2010.

    Acquisitions

On October 1, 2009, Quanta acquired Price Gregory in
    exchange for the issuance of approximately 10.9 million
    shares of Quanta common stock valued at approximately
    $231.8 million on the date of closing and the payment of
    approximately $95.8 million in cash. In connection with the
    acquisition, $0.5 million in cash and approximately
    1.5 million shares of Quanta common stock, valued at
    approximately $32.5 million, were placed into an escrow
    account, which will be maintained until April 1, 2011 for
    the settlement of any claims asserted by Quanta against the
    former stockholders of Price Gregory. Price Gregory provides
    natural gas and oil transmission pipeline infrastructure
    services in North America and expands Quanta’s service
    capabilities in this market. Price Gregory’s results of
    operations have been included in Quanta’s consolidated
    results of operations since October 1, 2009.

Also in 2009, Quanta completed three other acquisitions of
    specialty contractors with operations in the electric power,
    natural gas and telecommunications industries for an aggregate
    purchase price of approximately $36.0 million, consisting
    of a total of approximately $25.3 million in cash and
    approximately 0.5 million shares of Quanta common stock
    valued in the aggregate at approximately $10.7 million as
    of the dates of acquisition. These acquisitions enhance
    Quanta’s electric power, natural gas and pipeline and
    telecommunications capabilities throughout the various regions
    of the United States and Western Canada.

    Acquisitions

In 2008, Quanta acquired a telecommunications infrastructure
    services construction company, a helicopter-assisted electric
    transmission line installation, maintenance and repair services
    company and two affiliated professional telecommunications
    engineering companies in three separate transactions for an
    aggregate purchase price of approximately $54.1 million,
    consisting of a total of approximately $34.6 million in
    cash and approximately 1.0 million shares of Quanta common
    stock valued in the aggregate at approximately
    $19.5 million as of the dates of acquisitions. The
    acquisitions allow Quanta to further expand its
    telecommunications infrastructure services capabilities in the
    southwestern and southeastern United States and to augment its
    existing electric power infrastructure services.

The fair value of current assets acquired in 2010 includes
    accounts receivable with a fair value of $68.0 million. The
    fair value of current assets acquired in 2009 included accounts
    receivable with a fair value of $156.2 million.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
    net amount of the fair values assigned to assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed. The acquisition of Valard strategically
    expands Quanta’s Canadian service offering. Quanta believes
    the opportunities presented by this acquisition contribute to
    the recognition of the goodwill. In connection with this
    acquisition, goodwill of $109.4 million was recorded and
    included within Quanta’s electric power division at
    December 31, 2010. None of this goodwill is expected to be
    deductible for income tax purposes.

Additionally, the Price Gregory and other 2009 acquisitions
    furthered Quanta’s position in the North American energy
    transmission infrastructure market and will primarily enable
    Quanta to take advantage of the positive long-term outlook for
    this market. Quanta believes these opportunities contribute to
    the recognition of the goodwill. In connection with the 2009
    acquisitions, goodwill of $68.5 million was included within
    Quanta’s natural gas and pipeline division,
    $9.2 million has been assigned to Quanta’s
    telecommunications division and $8.6 million has been
    included within Quanta’s electric power division at
    December 31, 2009, all of which are closely aligned with
    Quanta’s corresponding reportable segments. None of this
    goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

    The pro forma combined results of operations for the year ended

    historical results of Quanta to include the historical results
    of the 2010 acquisition as if it occurred January 1, 2009

    results of operations for the year ending December 31, 2008
    have been prepared by adjusting the historical results of Quanta
    to include the historical results of the acquisitions completed
    in 2008 and 2009 as if the acquisitions occurred January 1,
    2008. These pro forma combined historical results were then
    adjusted for the following: a reduction of interest expense and
    interest income as a result of the repayment of outstanding
    indebtedness and the retirement of preferred stock, a reduction
    of interest income as a result of the cash consideration paid,
    an increase in amortization expense due to the incremental
    intangible assets recorded related to the 2010 and 2009
    acquisitions, an increase in depreciation expense within cost of
    services related to the net impact of adjusting acquired
    property and equipment to the acquisition date fair value and
    conforming depreciable lives with Quanta’s accounting
    policies and certain reclassifications to conform the acquired
    companies’ presentation to Quanta’s accounting
    policies. The pro forma results of operations do not include any
    adjustments to eliminate the impact of acquisition related costs
    or any cost savings or other synergies that may result from the
    2010, 2009 and 2008 acquisitions. As noted above, the pro forma
    results of operations do not purport to be indicative of the
    actual results that would have been achieved by the combined

For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, a
    nominal number of stock options were excluded from the
    computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise
    prices of these common stock equivalents were greater than the
    average market price of Quanta’s common stock. The
    3.9 million exchangeable shares of a Canadian subsidiary of
    Quanta that were issued pursuant to the acquisition of Valard on
    October 25, 2010, which are exchangeable on a

one-for-one

basis with Quanta common shares, are included in weighted
    average shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per
    share, weighted for the portion of the year they were
    outstanding. Shares placed in escrow related to the acquisition
    of Price Gregory are included in the computation of diluted
    earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2010
    and 2009, weighted according to the portion of the year they
    were outstanding. These shares will be released from escrow on
    April 1, 2011 when certain conditions are satisfied. For
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the
    effect of assuming conversion of Quanta’s 3.75% Notes would
    have been antidilutive and therefore the shares issuable upon
    conversion were excluded from the calculation of diluted
    earnings per share. Additionally, the 4.5% convertible
    subordinated notes were not outstanding after October 8,
    2008 but were dilutive to 2008 and have been included in the
    computation of 2008 diluted earnings per share above.

Credit
    Facility

Quanta has an agreement with various lenders that provides for a
    $475.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility
    maturing on September 19, 2012. Subject to the conditions
    specified in the credit facility, borrowings under the credit
    facility are to be used for working capital, capital
    expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The entire
    unused portion of the credit facility is available for the
    issuance of letters of credit.

As of December 31, 2010, Quanta had approximately
    $177.0 million of letters of credit issued under the credit
    facility and no outstanding revolving loans. The remaining
    $298.0 million was available for revolving loans or issuing
    new letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the credit
    facility bear interest, at Quanta’s option, at a rate equal
    to either (a) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the credit
    facility) plus 0.875% to 1.75%, as determined by the ratio of
    Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as
    defined in the credit facility), or (b) the base rate (as
    described below) plus 0.00% to 0.75%, as determined by the ratio
    of Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA.
    Letters of credit issued under the credit facility are subject
    to a letter of credit fee of 0.875% to 1.75%, based on the ratio
    of Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA.
    Quanta is also subject to a commitment fee of 0.15% to
    0.35%, based on the ratio of its total funded debt to
    consolidated EBITDA, on any unused availability under the credit
    facility. The base rate equals the higher of (i) the
    Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus


/


of 1% or (ii) the bank’s prime rate.

The credit facility contains certain covenants, including
    covenants with respect to maximum funded debt to consolidated
    EBITDA, maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA and minimum
    interest coverage, in each case as specified in the credit
    facility. For purposes of calculating the maximum funded debt to
    consolidated


QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

EBITDA ratio and the maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA
    ratio, Quanta’s maximum funded debt and maximum senior debt
    are reduced by all cash and cash equivalents (as defined in the
    credit facility) held by Quanta in excess of $25.0 million.
    As of December 31, 2010, Quanta was in compliance with all
    of its covenants. The credit facility limits certain
    acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, capital expenditures,
    asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to
    certain exceptions, prohibits liens on material assets. The
    credit facility also limits the payment of dividends and stock
    repurchase programs in any fiscal year except those payments or
    other distributions payable solely in capital stock. The credit
    facility provides for customary events of default and carries
    cross-default provisions with Quanta’s continuing indemnity
    and security agreement with its sureties and all of its other
    debt instruments exceeding $15.0 million in borrowings. If
    an event of default (as defined in the credit facility) occurs
    and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions
    set forth in the credit facility, amounts outstanding under the
    credit facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared
    immediately due and payable.

The credit facility is secured by a pledge of the capital stock
    of certain of Quanta’s subsidiaries and substantially all
    of Quanta’s assets. Quanta’s U.S. subsidiaries
    also guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the credit
    facility.

3.75% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

As of December 31, 2010, none of Quanta’s
    3.75% Notes were outstanding. The 3.75% Notes were
    originally issued in April 2006 for an aggregate principal
    amount of $143.8 million and required semi-annual interest
    payments on April 30 and October 30 until maturity.

On May 14, 2010, Quanta redeemed all of the
    $143.8 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of
    the 3.75% Notes at a redemption price of 101.607% of the
    principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest
    to, but not including, the date of redemption. The redemption
    resulted in a payment of the aggregate redemption price of
    $146.1 million and the recognition of a loss on early
    extinguishment of debt of approximately $7.1 million.
    Included in the loss on early extinguishment of debt was a
    non-cash loss of $3.5 million related to the difference
    between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of
    the 3.75% Notes, calculated as of the date of redemption,
    the payment of $2.3 million representing the 1.607%
    redemption premium above par value and a non-cash loss of
    $1.3 million from the write-off of the remaining
    unamortized deferred financing costs related to the
    3.75% Notes.

The $126.6 million of convertible subordinated notes on the
    consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 is
    presented net of a debt discount of $17.2 million, which
    was being amortized as interest expense. The effective interest
    rate that was used to calculate total interest expense for the
    3.75% Notes was 7.85%.

4.5% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, none of Quanta’s 4.5%
    convertible subordinated notes due 2023 (4.5% Notes) were
    outstanding. During 2008, the holders of $269.8 million
    aggregate principal amount of the 4.5% Notes elected to
    convert their notes, resulting in the issuance of
    24,229,781 shares of Quanta’s common stock,
    substantially all of which followed a notice of redemption by
    Quanta that it would redeem on October 8, 2008 all of the
    4.5% Notes outstanding pursuant to the indenture governing
    the notes. Quanta also repurchased or redeemed, as applicable,
    $155,000 aggregate principal amount of the 4.5% Notes in
    October 2008. As a result of all of these transactions, none of
    the 4.5% Notes remained outstanding as of October 8,
    2008. The 4.5% Notes were originally issued in October 2003
    for an aggregate principal amount of $270.0 million and
    required semi-annual interest payments on April 1 and October 1
    until maturity.

The valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets at
    December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $11.4 million,
    $8.6 million, and $9.2 million, respectively. These
    valuation allowances relate to state net operating loss
    carryforwards, a deferred tax asset for goodwill and foreign tax
    credit carryforwards. The net change in the total valuation
    allowance for each of the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009, and 2008 was an increase of $2.8 million, a decrease
    of $0.6 million and an increase of $0.9 million,
    respectively. The valuation allowance was

    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

established primarily as a result of uncertainty in our outlook
    as to future taxable income in particular tax jurisdictions.
    Quanta believes it is more likely than not that we will realize
    the benefit of our deferred tax assets, net of existing
    valuation allowances.

At December 31, 2010, Quanta had state and foreign net
    operating loss carryforwards, the tax effect of which is
    approximately $12.4 million. These carryforwards will
    expire as follows: 2011, $0.3 million; 2012,
    $0.3 million; 2013, $0.4 million; 2014,
    $0.3 million; 2015, $0.8 million and
    $10.3 million thereafter. The state net operating loss
    carryforwards have a valuation allowance of $6.3 million against
    the related deferred taxes.

Through December 31, 2010, Quanta has not provided
    U.S. income taxes on unremitted foreign earnings because
    such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside
    the U.S. It is not practicable to determine the amount of
    any additional U.S. tax liability that may result if Quanta
    decides to no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings

Quanta classifies interest and penalties within the provision
    for income taxes. Quanta recognized $2.2 million and
    $3.6 million of interest income and $4.8 million of
    interest expense and penalties in the provision for income taxes
    for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Quanta is subject to income tax in the United States, multiple
    state jurisdictions and a few foreign jurisdictions. Quanta
    remains open to examination by the IRS for tax years 2007
    through 2010 as these statutes of limitations have not yet
    expired. Quanta does not consider any state in which it does
    business to be a major tax jurisdiction.

EQUITY:

Exchangeable
    Shares and Series F Preferred Stock

In connection with acquisition of Valard as discussed in
    Notes 1 and 4, certain former owners of Valard received
    exchangeable shares of Quanta Services EC Canada Ltd. (EC
    Canada), one of Quanta’s wholly owned Canadian
    subsidiaries. The exchangeable shares may be exchanged at the
    option of the holder for Quanta common stock on a

one-for-one

basis. The holders of exchangeable shares can make an exchange
    only once in any calendar quarter and must exchange a minimum of
    either 50,000 shares or if less, the total number of
    remaining exchangeable shares registered in the name of the
    holder making the request. Quanta also issued one share of
    Quanta Series F preferred stock to a voting trust on behalf
    of the holders of the exchangeable shares. The Series F
    preferred stock provides the holders of the exchangeable shares
    voting rights in Quanta common stock equivalent to the number of
    exchangeable shares outstanding at any time. The combination of
    the exchangeable shares and the share of Series F preferred
    stock gives the holders of the exchangeable shares rights
    equivalent to Quanta common stockholders as far as dividends,
    voting and other economic rights.

Limited
    Vote Common Stock

The shares of Limited Vote Common Stock have rights similar to
    shares of common stock, except that such shares are entitled to
    elect one member of the Board of Directors and are entitled to
    one-tenth of one vote for each share held on all other matters.
    Each share of Limited Vote Common Stock will convert into common
    stock upon disposition by the holder of such shares in
    accordance with the transfer restrictions applicable to such
    shares. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008, 0 shares, 0 shares and 11,790 shares,
    respectively, of Limited Vote Common Stock were converted to
    common stock. In 2010, Quanta issued an aggregate
    241,300 shares of its common stock in exchange for an
    aggregate 229,808 shares of Limited Vote Common Stock. In
    addition, in 2008, Quanta issued an aggregate 90,394 shares
    of its common stock in exchange for an aggregate
    86,088 shares of Limited Vote Common Stock.

Treasury
    Stock

Pursuant to the stock incentive plans described in Note 11,
    employees may elect to satisfy their tax withholding obligations
    upon vesting of restricted stock by having Quanta make such tax
    payments and withhold a number of vested shares having a value
    on the date of vesting equal to their tax withholding
    obligation. As a result of such employee elections, Quanta
    withheld 243,821 shares of Quanta common stock in 2010 with
    a total market value of $4.6 million, 210,469 shares
    of Quanta common stock in 2009 with a total market value of
    $3.6 million and 188,714 shares of Quanta common stock
    in 2008 with a total market value of $4.5 million, in each
    case for settlement of employee tax liabilities. These shares
    were accounted for as treasury stock. Under Delaware corporate
    law, treasury stock is not entitled to vote or be counted for
    quorum purposes.

Noncontrolling
    Interest

Quanta has an investment in a joint venture that provides
    infrastructure services, including the design, installation and
    maintenance of electric transmission and distribution systems in
    the northeast United States, under a contract awarded by a large
    utility customer. The joint venture members each own equal
    equity interests in the

joint venture. Quanta has determined that the joint venture is a
    variable interest entity, with Quanta providing the majority of
    the subcontractor services to the joint venture, which
    management believes most significantly influences the economic
    performance of the joint venture. As a result, Quanta has
    determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the joint
    venture and has accounted for the results of the joint venture
    on a consolidated basis. The other party’s equity interest
    in the joint venture has been accounted for as a noncontrolling
    interest as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010
    and 2009. Additionally, Quanta holds investments in other
    individually insignificant joint ventures which are accounted
    for on a consolidated basis, due to Quanta having been deemed to
    be the primary beneficiary.

Quanta holds multiple investments in joint ventures. These joint
    ventures, which constitute variable interest entities, have been
    included on a consolidated basis in the accompanying financial
    statements, with income attributable to the other joint venture
    members accounted for as a reduction of reported net income
    attributable to common stock for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 in the amount of $2.4 million
    and $1.3 million. Equity in the consolidated assets and
    liabilities of the joint ventures attributable to the other
    joint venture members has been accounted for as a noncontrolling
    interest component of total equity in the accompanying balance
    sheet.

The carrying value of the investments held by Quanta and the
    noncontrolling interests in the variable interest entities that
    have been included on a consolidated basis in the accompanying
    financial statements at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were
    $1.4 million and $1.4 million. A $2.4 million
    distribution was made to a noncontrolling interest in the year
    ended December 31, 2010.

Comprehensive
    Income

Quanta’s foreign operations are translated into
    U.S. dollars, and a translation adjustment is recorded in
    other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as a result.
    Additionally, unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency
    cash flow hedges are also recorded in other comprehensive income
    (loss), net of tax, until the hedged transactions occur. The
    following table presents the components of comprehensive income
    for the periods presented (in thousands):

In the third quarter of 2009, one of Quanta’s Canadian
    operating units entered into three forward contracts with
    settlement dates in 2009 and 2010, to reduce foreign currency
    risk associated with anticipated customer sales that were
    denominated in South African rand. This same operating unit also
    entered into three additional forward contracts with the same
    settlement dates to reduce the foreign currency exposure
    associated with a series of forecasted intercompany payments
    denominated in U.S. dollars to be made over a twelve-month
    period. These contracts were accounted for as cash flow hedges.
    Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the forward contracts
    were recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) prior to
    their settlement and were reclassified into earnings in the
    periods in which the hedged transactions occurred.

The South African rand to Canadian dollar forward contracts had
    an aggregate notional amount of approximately $11.0 million
    ($CAD) at origination, and the Canadian dollar to
    U.S. Dollar forward contracts had an

aggregate notional amount of approximately $9.5 million
    (U.S.) at origination. During the year ended December 31,
    2010, net losses of $0.4 million were recorded in income in
    connection with the settled contracts. There were no forward
    contracts outstanding at December 31, 2010, and as a
    result, there is no balance related to the forward contracts in
    other comprehensive income. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, losses of $0.8 million were
    recorded in income in connection with the settled contracts, and
    at December 31, 2009, there was $0.4 million in other
    comprehensive income (loss) related to the forward contracts.

Effectiveness testing related to these cash flow hedges was
    performed at the end of each quarter while they were
    outstanding. Any ineffective portion of these contracts was
    reclassified into earnings if the derivatives were no longer
    deemed to be cash flow hedges. For the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, a nominal portion of the
    forward contracts were considered ineffective.

LONG-TERM
    INCENTIVE PLANS:

Stock
    Incentive Plans

Pursuant to the Quanta Services, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan
    (the 2007 Plan), which was adopted on May 24, 2007, Quanta
    may award restricted common stock, incentive stock options and
    non-qualified stock options. The purpose of the 2007 Plan is to
    provide directors, key employees, officers and certain
    consultants and advisors with additional performance incentives
    by increasing their proprietary interest in Quanta. Awards also
    remain outstanding under a prior plan adopted by Quanta, as well
    as under plans assumed by Quanta in connection with its
    acquisition of InfraSource Services, Inc. in 2007. While no
    further awards may be made under these plans, the awards
    outstanding under the plans continue to be governed by their
    terms. These plans, together with the 2007 Plan, are referred to
    as the Plans.

The 2007 Plan, which is the only plan sponsored by Quanta
    pursuant to which future awards may be made, provides for the
    award of incentive stock options (ISOs) as defined in
    Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended (the Code), nonqualified stock options and restricted
    stock (collectively, the Awards). The aggregate number of shares
    of common stock with respect to which options or restricted
    stock may be awarded may not exceed 4,000,000 shares of
    common stock. The 2007 Plan is administered by the Compensation
    Committee of the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee
    has, subject to applicable regulation and the terms of the 2007
    Plan, the authority to grant Awards under the 2007 Plan, to
    construe and interpret the 2007 Plan and to make all other
    determinations and take any and all actions necessary or
    advisable for the administration of the 2007 Plan, provided that
    the Board, or authorized committee of the Board, may delegate to
    a committee of the Board designated as the Equity Grant
    Committee, consisting of one or more directors, the authority to
    grant limited Awards to eligible persons who are not executive
    officers or non-employee directors. Specifically, the Equity
    Grant Committee has the authority to award stock options and
    restricted stock pursuant to the 2007 Plan, provided
    (i) the aggregate number of shares of common stock subject
    to stock options

and/or

shares of restricted stock awarded by the Equity Grant Committee
    in any calendar quarter does not exceed 100,000 shares (or
    20,000 shares in any calendar quarter with respect to any
    individual) and (ii) the aggregate value of restricted
    stock awarded by the Equity Grant Committee in any calendar
    quarter does not exceed $250,000 (or $25,000 with respect to any
    individual), in each case, determined based on the fair market
    value of the common stock on the date the restricted stock is
    awarded. In connection with the adoption of the 2007 Plan, the
    Board approved the designation of the Equity Grant Committee and
    appointed John R. Colson, Quanta’s Chairman of the Board
    and Chief Executive Officer, as sole member of the committee.

All of Quanta’s employees (including its executive officers
    and directors who are also employees), non-employee directors
    and certain consultants and advisors are eligible to receive
    awards under the 2007 Plan, but only its employees (including
    executive officers and directors who are also employees) are
    eligible to receive ISOs. Awards in the form of stock options
    are exercisable during the period specified in each stock option
    agreement and generally become exercisable in installments
    pursuant to a vesting schedule designated by the Compensation
    Committee or, if applicable, the Equity Grant Committee. No
    option will remain exercisable later than ten years


QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

after the date of award (or five years in the case of ISOs
    awarded to employees owning more than 10% of Quanta’s
    voting capital stock). The exercise price for ISOs awarded under
    the 2007 Plan may be no less than the fair market value of a
    share of common stock on the date of award (or 110% in the case
    of ISOs awarded to employees owning more than 10% of
    Quanta’s voting capital stock). Upon the exercise of new
    stock options, Quanta has historically issued shares of common
    stock rather than treasury shares or shares purchased on the
    open market, although the plan permits any of the three. Awards
    in the form of restricted stock are subject to forfeiture and
    other restrictions until they vest. Except in certain limited
    circumstances and with respect to restricted stock awards
    awarded by the Compensation Committee covering in the aggregate
    no more than 200,000 shares of common stock, any restricted
    stock award that vests on the basis of a grantee’s
    continuous service shall not provide for vesting that is any
    more rapid than annual pro rata vesting over a three year
    period, and any restricted stock award that vests upon the
    attainment of performance goals established by the Compensation
    Committee shall provide for a performance period of at least
    twelve months, in each case, as designated by the Compensation
    Committee or, if applicable, the Equity Grant Committee and as
    specified in each award agreement.

Restricted
    Stock

Restricted common stock has been issued under the Plans at the
    fair market value of the common stock as of the date of
    issuance. The shares of restricted common stock issued are
    subject to forfeiture, restrictions on transfer and certain
    other conditions until they vest, which generally occurs over
    three or four years in equal annual installments. During the
    restriction period, the restricted stockholders are entitled to
    vote and receive dividends on such shares.

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    Quanta granted 1.2 million, 1.1 million and
    0.8 million shares of restricted stock under the 2007 Plan
    with a weighted average grant price of $19.20, $22.10 and
    $23.57, respectively. During the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, 0.8 million, 0.6 million and
    0.6 million shares vested with an approximate fair value at
    the time of vesting of $14.7 million, $13.1 million
    and $15.0 million, respectively.

    December 31, 2010 is as follows (shares in thousands):

Restricted
    Stock Units

In 2010, Quanta adopted the Restricted Stock Unit Plan (the RSU
    Plan), pursuant to which restricted stock unit awards (RSUs) may
    be made to certain employees and consultants of Quanta’s
    Canadian operations. The RSU Plan is intended to provide plan
    participants with cash performance incentives that are
    substantially equivalent to the risks and rewards of equity
    ownership in Quanta by providing the participants with rights to
    receive a cash bonus that is determined by reference to
    Quanta’s common stock price. The number of RSUs granted to
    a plan participant is determined based on the dollar amount of
    the grant and the closing price on the date of grant of a share
    of Quanta common stock. The RSUs vest over a designated period,
    typically three years, and are subject to forfeiture under
    certain conditions, primarily termination of service. Upon
    vesting, the plan participant receives a cash bonus (converted
    to Canadian dollars using a specified exchange rate as set forth
    in the RSU agreement) equal to the number of RSUs vested
    multiplied by Quanta’s common stock price on the vesting
    date.

Compensation expense related to RSUs was $0.5 million,
    $0.0 million and $0.0 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Such expense is recorded
    in selling, general and administrative expenses. As the
    RSU’s are settled only in cash, they are not included in
    the earnings per share calculation and are classified as
    liabilities. Liabilities recorded under the RSUs were
    $0.2 million and $0.0 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS:

Unions’
    Multi-Employer Pension Plans

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
    by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980,
    imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors
    to a multi-employer plan in the event of the employer’s
    withdrawal from, or upon termination of, such plan. None of
    Quanta’s operating units have any current plans to withdraw
    from these plans. In addition, the Pension Protection Act of
    2006 added new funding rules generally applicable to plan years
    beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are
    classified as “endangered,” “seriously
    endangered,” or “critical” status. For a plan in
    critical status, additional required contributions and benefit
    reductions may apply. A number of plans to which Quanta
    operating units contribute or may contribute in the future are
    in “critical” status. Certain of these plans may
    require additional contributions, generally in the form of a
    surcharge on future benefit contributions required for future
    work performed by union employees covered by these plans. The
    amount of additional funds, if any, that Quanta may be


QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be
    estimated, as such amounts will likely be based on future levels
    of work that require the specific use of those union employees
    covered by these plans. Contributions to all union
    multi-employer pension plans by Quanta were approximately
    $77.1 million, $84.0 million and $76.8 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Quanta
    401(k) Plan

Quanta has a 401(k) plan pursuant to which employees who are not
    provided retirement benefits through a collective bargaining
    agreement may make contributions through a payroll deduction.
    Quanta makes matching cash contributions of 100% of each
    employee’s contribution up to 3% of that employee’s
    salary and 50% of each employee’s contribution between 3%
    and 6% of such employee’s salary, up to the maximum amount
    permitted by law. Contributions to all non-union defined
    contribution plans by Quanta were approximately
    $10.2 million, $10.0 million and $10.4 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

Certain of Quanta’s operating units have entered into
    related party lease arrangements for operational facilities,
    typically with prior owners of certain acquired businesses.
    These lease agreements generally have terms of up to five years.
    Related party lease expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately
    $3.2 million, $5.4 million and $3.9 million,
    respectively.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES:

Joint
    Venture Contingencies

As described in Note 10, one of Quanta’s operating
    units entered into a joint venture with a third party
    engineering company for the purpose of providing infrastructure
    services under a contract with a large utility customer. Losses
    incurred by the joint venture are typically shared equally by
    the joint venture members. However, under the terms of the joint
    venture agreement, each member of the joint venture has
    guaranteed all of the obligations of the joint venture under the
    contract with the customer and therefore can be liable for full
    performance of the contract to the customer. Quanta is not aware
    of circumstances that would lead to future claims against it for
    material amounts in connection with this performance guarantee.

One of Quanta’s operating units operates under the terms of
    an unincorporated joint venture that provides joint engineering
    and construction services for the design and installation of
    fuel storage facilities under a contract for a specific
    customer. The joint venture is a general partnership, and the
    joint venture partners each own an equal equity interest in the
    joint venture and participate equally in the profits and losses
    of the entity. Quanta has determined that its investment in this
    joint venture partnership represents an undivided 50% interest
    in the assets, liabilities, revenues and profits of the joint
    venture, and such amounts have been proportionally consolidated
    in the accompanying financial statements. As a general
    partnership, the joint venture partners are jointly and
    severally liable for all of the obligations of the joint
    venture, including obligations owed to the customer or any other
    person or entity. Quanta is not aware of circumstances that
    would lead to future claims against it for material amounts in
    connection with its joint and several liability.

In each of the above joint venture arrangements, each joint
    venturer has indemnified the other party for any liabilities
    incurred in excess of the liabilities for which such other party
    is obligated to bear under the respective joint venture
    agreement. It is possible, however, that Quanta could be
    required to pay or perform obligations in excess of its share if
    the other joint venturer failed or refused to pay or perform its
    share of the obligations. Quanta is not aware of circumstances
    that would lead to future claims against it for material amounts
    that would not be indemnified.

Leases

Quanta leases certain land, buildings and equipment under
    non-cancelable lease agreements, including related party leases
    as discussed in Note 13. The terms of these agreements vary
    from lease to lease, including some with renewal options and
    escalation clauses. The following schedule shows the future
    minimum lease payments under these leases as of
    December 31, 2010 (in thousands):

    for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Quanta has guaranteed the residual value on certain of its
    equipment operating leases. Quanta guarantees the difference
    between this residual value and the fair market value of the
    underlying asset at the date of termination of the leases. At
    December 31, 2010, the maximum guaranteed residual value
    was approximately $116.4 million. Quanta believes that no
    significant payments will be made as a result of the difference
    between the fair market value of the leased equipment and the
    guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no assurance
    that significant payments will not be required in the future.

Committed
    Capital Expenditures

Quanta has committed various amounts of capital for expansion of
    its fiber optic network. Quanta typically does not commit
    capital to new network expansions until it has a committed
    licensing arrangement in place with at least one customer. The
    amounts of committed capital expenditures are estimates of costs
    required to build the networks under contract. The actual
    capital expenditures related to building the networks could vary
    materially from these estimates. As of December 31, 2010,
    Quanta estimates these committed capital expenditures to be
    approximately $15.1 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2011.

Litigation
    and Claims

Quanta is from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims
    and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These actions typically seek, among other things,
    compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract

and/or

property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
    losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all
    such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, Quanta records a reserve
    when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
    amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Quanta
    discloses matters for which management believes a material loss
    is at least reasonably possible. Except as otherwise stated
    below, none of these proceedings, separately or in the
    aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect on
    Quanta’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows. In all instances, management has
    assessed the matter based on current information and made a
    judgment concerning their potential outcome, giving due
    consideration to the nature of the claim, the amount and nature
    of damages sought and the probability of success.
    Management’s judgment may prove materially inaccurate, and
    such judgment is made subject to the known uncertainty of
    litigation.

California Fire Litigation — San Diego
    County.

On June 18, 2010, PAR Electrical
    Contractors, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Quanta (PAR),
    was named as a third party defendant in four lawsuits in
    California state court in San Diego County, California, all
    of which arise out of a wildfire in the San Diego area that
    started on October 21, 2007 referred to as the Witch Creek
    fire. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
    issued a report concluding that the Witch Creek fire was started
    when the conductors of a three phase 69kV transmission line,
    known as TL 637, owned by San Diego Gas &
    Electric (SDG&E) touched each other, dropping sparks on dry
    grass. The Witch Creek fire, together with another wildfire
    referred to as the Guejito fire that merged with the Witch Creek
    fire, burned a reported 198,000 acres, over 1,500 homes and
    structures and is alleged to have caused 2 deaths and numerous
    personal injuries.

Numerous additional lawsuits were filed directly against
    SDG&E and its parent company, Sempra, claiming
    SDG&E’s power lines caused the fire. The court ordered
    that the claims be organized into the four lawsuits mentioned
    above and grouped the matters by type of plaintiff, namely,
    insurance subrogation claimants, individual/business claimants,
    governmental claimants, and a class action matter, for which
    class certification has since been denied. PAR is not named as a
    defendant in any of these lawsuits against SDG&E or its
    parent. SDG&E has reportedly settled many of the claims. On
    June 18, 2010, SDG&E joined PAR to the four lawsuits
    as a third party defendant seeking contractual and equitable
    indemnification for losses related to the Witch Creek fire,
    although a claim for specific damages has not been made.
    SDG&E’s claims for indemnity relate to work done by
    PAR involving the replacement of one pole on TL 637 about four
    months prior to the Witch Creek fire. Quanta does not believe
    that the work done by PAR was the cause of the contact between
    the conductors. However, PAR has notified its various insurers
    of the claims. One insurer has accepted PAR’s notification
    for coverage, another has issued a reservation of rights letter,
    while others have not stated their position or have denied
    coverage. PAR is vigorously defending the third party claims and
    continues to work with the insurers to ensure coverage of any
    potential liabilities. An amount equal to the deductibles under
    Quanta’s applicable insurance policies has been expensed,
    and a liability and corresponding insurance recovery receivable
    of $35 million have been recorded in connection with these
    matters. Given PAR’s defenses to the indemnity claims, as
    well as the potential for insurance coverage, Quanta cannot
    estimate the amount of any possible loss or the range of
    possible losses which may exceed Quanta’s applicable
    insurance coverage. However, due to the nature of these claims,
    an adverse result in these proceedings leading to a significant
    uninsured loss could have a material effect on Quanta’s
    consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

California Fire Claim — Amador
    County.

In October 2004, a wildfire in Amador
    County, California, burned 16,800 acres. The United States
    Forest Service alleged that the fire originated as a result of
    the activities of a Quanta subsidiary crew performing vegetation
    management under a contract with Pacific Gas &
    Electric Co. (PG&E). In November 2007, the United States
    Department of Agriculture (USDA) sent a written demand to the
    Quanta subsidiary for payment of fire suppression costs of
    approximately $8.46 million. The USDA recently communicated
    verbally that it also intends to seek past and future
    restoration and other damages of approximately
    $51.3 million. No litigation has been filed. PG&E
    tendered defense and indemnification for the matter to Quanta in
    2010. The USDA, Quanta, its subsidiary and PG&E have
    entered into a tolling agreement with respect to the filing of
    any litigation and are exchanging information on an informal
    basis.

Quanta and its subsidiary intend to vigorously defend any
    liability and damage allegations. Quanta has notified its
    insurers, and one insurer is participating under a reservation
    of rights. Other insurers in that policy year have not stated a
    position regarding coverage. Given Quanta’s intent to
    vigorously defend and the potential for insurance coverage,
    Quanta has not reserved any losses and cannot estimate the
    amount of any loss or the range of any possible losses. However,
    due to the nature of these claims, an adverse result leading to
    a significant uninsured loss could have a material effect on
    Quanta’s consolidated financial condition, results of
    operation and cash flows.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Quanta is subject to concentrations of credit risk related
    primarily to its cash and cash equivalents and its accounts
    receivable, including amounts related to unbilled accounts
    receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of
    billings on uncompleted contracts. Substantially all of
    Quanta’s cash investments are managed by what it believes
    to be high credit quality financial institutions. In accordance
    with Quanta’s investment policies, these institutions are
    authorized to invest this cash in a diversified portfolio of
    what Quanta believes to be high quality investments, which
    consist primarily of interest-bearing demand deposits, money
    market mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper with
    original maturities of three months or less. Although Quanta
    does not currently believe the principal amount of these
    investments is subject to any material risk of loss, the
    weakness in the economy has significantly impacted the interest
    income Quanta receives from these investments and is likely to
    continue to do so in the future. In addition, Quanta grants
    credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral,
    to its customers, which include electric power, natural gas and
    pipeline companies, telecommunications and cable television
    system operators, governmental entities, general contractors,
    and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial
    properties located primarily in the United States. Consequently,
    Quanta is subject to potential credit risk related to changes in
    business and economic factors throughout the United States,
    which may be heightened as a result of negative economic and
    market conditions. However, Quanta generally has certain
    statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Under
    certain circumstances, such as foreclosures or negotiated
    settlements, Quanta may take title to the underlying assets in
    lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. In such
    circumstances, extended time frames may be required to liquidate
    these assets, causing the amounts realized to differ from the
    value of the assumed receivable. Historically, some of
    Quanta’s customers have experienced significant financial
    difficulties, and others may experience financial difficulties
    in the future. These difficulties expose Quanta to increased
    risk related to collectability of receivables and costs and
    estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted
    contracts for services Quanta has performed. One customer
    accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated revenues during
    the year ended December 31, 2010 and approximately 12% of
    billed and accrued receivables at December 31, 2010.
    Business with this customer is included in the Natural Gas and
    Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment. No other customers
    represented 10% or more of revenues for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 or of accounts receivable
    as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Self-Insurance

Quanta is insured for employer’s liability, general
    liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation claims.
    Since August 1, 2009, all policy deductible levels are
    $5.0 million per occurrence, other than employer’s
    liability, which is subject to a deductible of
    $1.0 million. Quanta also has employee health care benefit
    plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining
    agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible
    of $350,000 per claimant per year. For the policy year ended
    July 31, 2009, employer’s liability claims were
    subject to a deductible of $1.0 million per occurrence,
    general liability and auto liability claims were subject to a
    deductible of $3.0 million per occurrence, and
    workers’ compensation claims were subject to a deductible
    of $2.0 million per occurrence. Additionally, for the
    policy year ended July 31, 2009, Quanta’s
    workers’ compensation claims were subject to an annual
    cumulative aggregate liability of up to $1.0 million on
    claims in excess of $2.0 million per occurrence.
    Quanta’s deductibles were generally lower in periods prior
    to August 1, 2008.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon Quanta’s estimates of the ultimate liability for
    claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not
    reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These
    insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due
    to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the
    extent of damage, the determination of Quanta’s liability
    in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not
    reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical
    trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate. As
    of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the gross amount accrued for
    insurance claims totaled $216.8 million and
    $184.7 million, with $164.3 million and
    $130.1 million considered to be long-term and included in
    other non-current liabilities. Related insurance
    recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2010 and 2009
    were $66.3 million and $33.7 million, of which
    $9.4 million and $13.4 million are

included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and
    $56.9 million and $20.3 million are included in other
    assets, net.

Quanta renews its insurance policies on an annual basis, and
    therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may
    change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel
    Quanta’s coverage or determine to exclude certain items
    from coverage, or the cost to obtain such coverage may become
    unreasonable. In any such event, Quanta’s overall risk
    exposure would increase, which could negatively affect its
    results of operations and financial condition.

Letters
    of Credit

Certain of Quanta’s vendors require letters of credit to
    ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on its
    behalf, such as to beneficiaries under its self-funded insurance
    programs. In addition, from time to time some customers require
    Quanta to post letters of credit to ensure payment to its
    subcontractors and vendors under those contracts and to
    guarantee performance under its contracts. Such letters of
    credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial
    institution. The letter of credit commits the issuer to pay
    specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the
    holder demonstrates that Quanta has failed to perform specified
    actions. If this were to occur, Quanta would be required to
    reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the
    circumstances of such a reimbursement, Quanta may also have to
    record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. Quanta does
    not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be
    made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2010, Quanta had $177.0 million in
    letters of credit outstanding under its credit facility
    primarily to secure obligations under its casualty insurance
    program. These are irrevocable stand-by letters of credit with
    maturities generally expiring at various times throughout 2011.
    Upon maturity, it is expected that the majority of these letters
    of credit will be renewed for subsequent one-year periods.

Performance
    Bonds and Parent Guarantees

In certain circumstances, Quanta is required to provide
    performance bonds in connection with its contractual
    commitments. Quanta has indemnified its sureties for any
    expenses paid out under these performance bonds. As of
    December 31, 2010, the total amount of outstanding
    performance bonds was approximately $1.10 billion, and the
    estimated cost to complete these bonded projects was
    approximately $521.4 million.

Quanta, from time to time, guarantees the obligations of its
    wholly owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain
    contracts with customers, certain lease obligations and, in some
    states, obligations in connection with obtaining
    contractors’ licenses. Quanta has also guaranteed the
    obligations of its wholly owned subsidiary under the joint
    venture arrangement with a third party engineering company.

Employment
    Agreements

Quanta has various employment agreements with certain executives
    and other employees, which provide for compensation and certain
    other benefits and for severance payments under certain
    circumstances. Certain employment agreements also contain
    clauses that become effective upon a change of control of
    Quanta. Upon the occurrence of any of the defined events in the
    various employment agreements, Quanta will pay certain amounts
    to the employee, which vary with the level of the
    employee’s responsibility.

Collective
    Bargaining Agreements

Certain of Quanta’s operating units are parties to various
    collective bargaining agreements with certain of their
    employees. The agreements require such subsidiaries to pay
    specified wages, provide certain benefits to their union
    employees and contribute certain amounts to multi-employer
    pension plans and employee benefit trusts. Quanta’s
    multi-employer pension plan contribution rates are determined
    annually and are assessed on a “pay-as-you go” basis
    based on its union employee payrolls, which cannot be determined
    for future periods because the location and

    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

number of union employees that Quanta has employed at any given
    time and the plans in which they may participate vary depending
    on projects Quanta has ongoing at any time and the need for
    union resources in connection with those projects. The
    collective bargaining agreements expire at various times and
    have typically been renegotiated and renewed on terms similar to
    the ones contained in the expiring agreements.

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
    by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980,
    imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors
    to a multi-employer plan in the event of the employer’s
    withdrawal from, or upon termination of, such plan. None of
    Quanta’s operating units have any current plans to withdraw
    from these plans. In addition, the Pension Protection Act of
    2006 added new funding rules generally applicable to plan years
    beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are
    classified as “endangered,” “seriously
    endangered,” or “critical” status. For a plan in
    critical status, additional required contributions and benefit
    reductions may apply. A number of plans to which Quanta
    operating units contribute or may contribute in the future are
    in “critical” status. Certain of these plans may
    require additional contributions, generally in the form of a
    surcharge on future benefit contributions required for future
    work performed by union employees covered by the plans. The
    amount of additional funds, if any, that Quanta may be obligated
    to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated,
    as such amounts will likely be based on future levels of work
    that require the specific use of those union employees covered
    by these plans.

Indemnities

Quanta has indemnified various parties against specified
    liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in
    connection with Quanta’s previous acquisitions of certain
    companies. The indemnities under acquisition agreements usually
    are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that
    reach specified thresholds. Quanta also generally indemnifies
    its customers for the services it provides under its contracts,
    as well as other specified liabilities, which may subject Quanta
    to indemnity claims and liabilities and related litigation. As
    of December 31, 2010, except as otherwise set forth above
    in

Litigation and Claims

, Quanta does not believe any
    material liabilities for asserted claims exist against it in
    connection with any of these indemnity obligations.

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION:

Quanta presents its operations under four reportable segments:
    (1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services,
    (2) Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services,
    (3) Telecommunications Infrastructure Services and
    (4) Fiber Optic Licensing. This structure is generally
    focused on broad end-user markets for Quanta’s services.

The Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment provides
    comprehensive network solutions to customers in the electric
    power industry. Services performed by the Electric Power
    Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design,
    installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power
    transmission and distribution networks and substation facilities
    along with other engineering and technical services. This
    segment also provides emergency restoration services, including
    repairing infrastructure damaged by inclement weather, the
    energized installation, maintenance and upgrade of electric
    power infrastructure utilizing unique bare hand and hot stick
    methods and our proprietary robotic arm technologies, and the
    installation of “smart grid” technologies on electric
    power networks. In addition, this segment designs, installs and
    maintains renewable energy generation facilities, in particular
    solar and wind, and related switchyards and transmission
    networks. To a lesser extent, this segment provides services
    such as the design, installation, maintenance and repair of
    commercial and industrial wiring, installation of traffic
    networks and the installation of cable and control systems for
    light rail lines.

The Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment
    provides comprehensive network solutions to customers involved
    in the transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline
    products. Services performed by the Natural Gas and Pipeline
    Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design,
    installation, repair and maintenance of natural gas and oil
    transmission and distribution systems, compressor and pump
    stations and gas gathering systems, as well as related
    trenching, directional boring and automatic welding services. In
    addition, this segment’s services include pipeline
    protection, pipeline integrity and rehabilitation and
    fabrication of pipeline

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

support systems and related structures and facilities. To a
    lesser extent, this segment designs, installs and maintains
    airport fueling systems as well as water and sewer
    infrastructure.

The Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segment provides
    comprehensive network solutions to customers in the
    telecommunications and cable television industries. Services
    performed by the Telecommunications Infrastructure Services
    segment generally include the design, installation, repair and
    maintenance of fiber optic, copper and coaxial cable networks
    used for video, data and voice transmission, as well as the
    design, installation and upgrade of wireless communications
    networks, including towers, switching systems and
    “backhaul” links from wireless systems to voice, data
    and video networks. This segment also provides emergency
    restoration services, including repairing telecommunications
    infrastructure damaged by inclement weather. To a lesser extent,
    services provided under this segment include cable locating,
    splicing and testing of fiber optic networks and residential
    installation of fiber optic cabling.

The Fiber Optic Licensing segment designs, procures, constructs
    and maintains fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure in
    select markets and licenses the right to use these

point-to-point

fiber optic telecommunications facilities to its customers
    pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with licensing terms
    from five to twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal
    options. Under those agreements, customers are provided the
    right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic
    facility, with the facility owned and maintained by Quanta. The
    Fiber Optic Licensing segment provides services to enterprise,
    education, carrier, financial services and healthcare customers,
    as well as other entities with high bandwidth telecommunication
    needs. The telecommunication services provided through this
    segment are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications
    Commission and certain state public utility commissions.

Quanta’s segment results are derived from the types of
    services provided across its operating units in each of the end
    user markets described above. Quanta’s entrepreneurial
    business model allows each of its operating units to serve the
    same or similar customers and to provide a range of services
    across end user markets. Quanta’s operating units are
    organized into one of three internal divisions, namely, the
    electric power division, natural gas and pipeline division and
    telecommunications division. These internal divisions are
    closely aligned with the reportable segments described above
    based on their operating units’ predominant type of work,
    with the operating units providing predominantly
    telecommunications and fiber optic licensing services being
    managed within the same internal division.

Reportable segment information, including revenues and operating
    income by type of work, is gathered from each operating unit for
    the purpose of evaluating segment performance in support of
    Quanta’s market strategies. These classifications of
    Quanta’s operating unit revenues by type of work for
    segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the
    part of management. Quanta’s operating units may perform
    joint infrastructure service projects for customers in multiple
    industries, deliver multiple types of network services under a
    single customer contract or provide service across industries,
    for example, joint trenching projects to install distribution
    lines for electric power, natural gas and telecommunications
    customers.

In addition, Quanta’s integrated operations and common
    administrative support at each of its operating units requires
    that certain allocations, including allocations of shared and
    indirect costs, such as facility costs, indirect operating
    expenses including depreciation, and general and administrative
    costs, are made to determine operating segment profitability.
    Corporate costs, such as payroll and benefits, employee travel
    expenses, facility costs, professional fees, acquisition costs
    and amortization related to certain intangible assets are not
    allocated.

Separate measures of Quanta’s assets and cash flows,

    produced or utilized by management to evaluate segment
    performance. Quanta’s fixed assets include operating
    machinery, equipment and vehicles that are used on an
    interchangeable basis across its reportable segments, as well as
    office equipment, buildings and leasehold improvements that are
    shared across segment operations. As a result, depreciation is
    allocated to Quanta’s reportable segments based upon each
    operating unit’s revenue contribution to each reportable
    segment.

Foreign
    Operations

Quanta does not have significant operations or long-lived assets
    in countries outside of the United States. During 2010, 2009,
    and 2008, Quanta derived $256.1 million,
    $112.2 million and $98.8 million, respectively, of its
    revenues from foreign operations, the majority of which was
    earned in Canada. In addition, Quanta held property and
    equipment of $94.0 million and $57.1 million in
    foreign countries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The
    increase in property and equipment held by Quanta in foreign
    countries from 2009 to 2010 is primarily associated with the
    acquisition of Valard.

Controls
    and Procedures

Attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

are certifications of Quanta’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer that are required in accordance with

Rule 13a-14

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
    Act). This

section
    includes information concerning the controls and controls
    evaluation referred to in the certifications, and it should be
    read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete
    understanding of the topics presented.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management has established and maintains a system of
    disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide
    reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
    by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
    Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC rules and forms. The disclosure controls and procedures are
    also designed to provide reasonable assurance that such
    information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we
    evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to

Rule 13a-15(b)

of the Exchange Act. This evaluation was carried out under the
    supervision and with the participation of our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer. Based on this evaluation, these officers have concluded
    that, as of December 31, 2010, our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance of
    achieving their objectives.

Evaluation
    of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management’s Annual Report on internal control over
    financial reporting can be found in Item 8 of this Annual
    Report under the heading “Report of Management” and is
    incorporated herein by reference. The report of
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, on the financial statements, and its opinion on
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, can also be found in Item 8 of this Annual
    Report under the heading “Report of Independent Registered
    Public Accounting Firm” and is incorporated herein by
    reference.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2010, that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

Design
    and Operation of Control Systems

Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting
    will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control
    system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
    only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control
    system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control
    system must reflect the fact that there are resource
    constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
    relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent
    limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
    can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
    or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances
    of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These
    inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
    decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because
    of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can be circumvented by
    the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
    people, or by management override of the controls. The design of
    any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions
    about the


likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
    any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
    potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in
    the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
