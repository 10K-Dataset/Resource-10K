PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

General

Quanta Services, Inc. (Quanta) is a leading national provider of
    specialty contracting services, and we believe we are one of the
    largest contractors serving the transmission and distribution
    sector of the North American electric utility industry. We
    currently operate in two business segments. The infrastructure
    services (Infrastructure Services) segment provides specialized
    contracting services, offering end-to-end network solutions to
    the electric power, gas, telecommunications and cable television
    industries. Specifically, the comprehensive services provided by
    the Infrastructure Services segment include designing,
    installing, repairing and maintaining network infrastructure, as
    well as certain ancillary services. Additionally, the dark fiber
    (Dark Fiber) segment designs, procures, constructs and maintains
    fiber-optic telecommunications infrastructure in select markets
    and licenses the right to use point-to-point fiber-optic
    telecommunications facilities to our customers. The Dark Fiber
    segment services educational institutions, large industrial and
    financial services customers and other entities with high
    bandwidth telecommunication needs.

Our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31,
    2008 were approximately $3.78 billion, of which 56.8% was
    attributable to electric power work, 20.8% to gas work, 14.2% to
    telecommunications and cable television work and 6.6% to
    ancillary services. In addition, 1.6% of our consolidated
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 was generated
    by the Dark Fiber segment.

We have established a nationwide presence with a workforce of
    over 14,000 employees, which enables us to quickly and
    reliably serve a diversified customer base. We believe our
    reputation for responsiveness, performance, geographic reach and
    a comprehensive service offering has resulted in strong
    relationships with numerous customers, which include many of the
    leading companies in the industries we serve.

We were organized as a corporation in the state of Delaware in
    1997, and since that time have grown organically and made
    strategic acquisitions to expand our geographic presence and
    scope of services and to develop new capabilities to meet our
    customers’ evolving needs. On August 30, 2007, we
    acquired, through a merger transaction (the Merger), all of the
    outstanding common stock of InfraSource Services, Inc.
    (InfraSource). Similar to us, InfraSource provided design,
    procurement, construction, testing and maintenance services to
    electric power utilities, natural gas utilities,
    telecommunication customers, government entities and heavy
    industrial companies, such as petrochemical, processing and
    refining businesses, primarily in the United States. As a result
    of the Merger, we enhanced and expanded our position as a
    leading specialized contracting services company serving the
    electric power, gas, telecommunications and cable television
    industries and added the Dark Fiber segment.



Industry
    Overview

Described below are various industry trends that we believe will
    increase demand for our services over the long-term. We
    recognize, however, that we and our customers are operating in a
    challenging business environment in light of the economic
    downturn and volatile capital markets. We expect these economic
    and market conditions to negatively impact demand for our
    services until the conditions improve significantly. Therefore,
    we cannot predict the timing or magnitude that any of these
    trends will have on demand for our services, particularly in the
    near-term.

Need to upgrade electric power transmission and distribution
    networks.

The U.S. and Canadian electric
    power grid, which consists of more than 200,000 miles of
    high-voltage lines delivering electricity to over
    300 million people, is aging and requires significant
    maintenance and expansion to handle the U.S. and
    Canada’s current and growing power needs. In addition, the
    grid must facilitate the sale of electricity across competitive
    regional networks, a function for which it was not originally
    designed. According to the North American Electric Reliability
    Council (NERC), industry professionals rank the aging
    infrastructure and limited new construction as the number one
    challenge to reliability of the transmission system.

While the grid continues to deteriorate, demand for electricity
    is expected to continue to grow over the long-term. According to
    the 2008 Annual Energy Outlook published by the
    U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information
    Administration (EIA), the population in the United States has
    increased by 20% since 1990, with energy consumption increasing
    by a comparable 18%. The EIA also projects in the same report
    that total U.S. electricity sales from producers to
    consumers will increase by 41% from 3,660 billion

kilowatt-hours

in 2005 to 5,168 billion

kilowatt-hours

in 2030. NERC reports in its 2008 Long-Term Reliability
    Assessment that peak demand for electricity in the U.S., which
    typically occurs in the summer, is forecasted to increase by
    16.6% over the next ten years.

This increasing demand, coupled with the aging infrastructure,
    will affect reliability, requiring utilities to upgrade their
    existing transmission and distribution systems. These system
    upgrades are expected to result in increased spending over the
    next several years. According to a 2008 Edison Electric
    Institute (EEI) report, investor-owned utilities spent a total
    of $6.9 billion on their transmission systems in 2006 and
    plan to invest an additional $38.1 billion in their
    transmission systems from 2007 to 2010. This represents a 60%
    increase over the amount invested from 2003 to 2006. NERC
    projects the number of transmission miles will increase by 9.5%
    or 15,700 circuit miles in the U.S. over the next ten
    years. The Brattle Group, an independent consulting firm,
    reported in 2008 that by 2030, the electric utility industry
    will need to make a total infrastructure investment of between
    $1.5 trillion and $2.0 trillion to meet projected demand. The
    estimates from the Brattle Group include investments of
    $697 billion for new generation capacity, $298 billion
    for new transmission infrastructure and $583 billion for
    new distribution infrastructure. We believe that we are the
    partner of choice for utilities in need of broad infrastructure
    expertise, specialty equipment and workforce resources as they
    work to address the aging infrastructure requirements and
    increasing demand. We also believe that our utility customers
    generally remain financially healthy and are currently able to
    obtain financing for projects despite the instability in the
    financial markets. A long-term or deep recession, however, will
    likely have a negative impact on our customers’ spending,
    and a continued decline in the capital markets may negatively
    affect our customers’ plans for future projects, which
    could be delayed, reduced or eliminated if funding is not
    available.

Increased opportunities related to renewable
    energy.

We consider renewable energy, including
    wind and solar, to be one of the largest, most rapidly emerging
    opportunities for our engineering, project management and
    installation services. Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions,
    as well as the need to reduce reliance on power generation from
    fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, are creating the
    drive for more renewable energy. According to its annual report,
    the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) stated that
    U.S. capacity to generate power from wind turbines grew by
    a record 8,358 megawatts in 2008 as a result of $17 billion
    in investments. This represents 50% growth and brings the
    nation’s total renewable capacity to about 4% of the
    overall generation portfolio. Under current mandates in
    30 states, renewable energy is required to account for up
    to 30% of a utility’s energy generation portfolio within
    the next five to fifteen years. Renewable portfolio standards
    require seven to nine gigawatts to be from solar generation.
    Under the new presidential



administration, there is potential for the implementation of
    national renewable standards, which are expected to set a target
    of generating at least 10% of the nation’s electricity from
    renewables by 2012 and 25% by 2025. We believe that our
    comprehensive services, industry knowledge and experience in the
    design, installation and maintenance of renewable facilities
    will enable us to support our customers’ renewable energy
    efforts.

The latter part of 2008 experienced a slowdown in renewable
    spending, due in part to the economic downturn as well as the
    outcome of potential new legislation. The signing of the
    American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) in
    February 2009 resolved some of the legislative uncertainty by
    the extension of renewable tax credits through 2012 for
    producing wind energy. Industry experts anticipate that this
    extension will stabilize the market and encourage ongoing
    investment related to renewable energy facilities, although
    investment may continue to be negatively impacted by constraints
    on capital for new projects as a result of unfavorable economic
    and market conditions.

Increased demand calls for new generation sources and related
    connectivity to the grid.

As we discuss above,
    demand for power is increasing. As demand for power grows, the
    need for new power generation sources will grow as well. There
    is an increased focus on the development of renewable power
    sources such as wind, solar and hydro electric. However, as
    renewable power resources will only fulfill a portion of the
    increased demand in the future, we also expect a continuation of
    new power generation based on traditional resources, such as
    natural gas. The future development of new power generation
    sources will require connectivity to the grid to transport power
    to demand centers. Renewable energy in particular will require
    significant transmission infrastructure due to the often remote
    location of renewable sources of energy. As a result, we
    anticipate that future development of new power generation will
    lead to increased demand over the long-term for our transmission
    and substation engineering and installation services.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other legislative
    initiatives.

We expect the Energy Policy Act of
    2005 (Energy Act), which was enacted in August 2005, to result
    in increased spending by the power industry over the next
    decade. Since enactment, several aspects of the Energy Act have
    come into effect and, as a result, have better positioned
    utilities to finance and implement system enhancements. The
    objectives of the Energy Act include improving the nation’s
    electric transmission capacity and reliability and promoting
    investment in the nation’s energy infrastructure. It
    provides for a self-regulating reliability organization to
    implement and enforce mandatory reliability standards on all
    market participants, with oversight by the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission (FERC). FERC has issued rules to provide a
    more favorable return on equity for transmission system owners,
    and it has approved incentive rates to encourage transmission
    expansion and help ensure reliability in certain regions of the
    nation.

We anticipate that aspects of the Energy Act will make
    investment in the nation’s transmission system more
    attractive and lead to a streamlined permitting process. For
    example, the Energy Act provides for the designation of National
    Interest Electric Transmission Corridors (NIETCs) to facilitate
    siting of new transmission infrastructure. In October 2007, the
    Department of Energy (DOE) designated two NIETCs — the
    Mid-Atlantic Area National Corridor and the Southwest Area
    National Corridor. These NIETCs include two of the nation’s
    most populated regions with major transmission
    congestion — the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region and the
    Southwest region. The NIETCs will be in effect for 12 years
    to give regional transmission owners and utilities time to
    evaluate, plan, and build additional transmission infrastructure
    in the NIETCs. In addition, FERC was given “backstop”
    authority to issue permits to construct or modify electric
    transmission facilities in the NIETCs under certain
    circumstances, and in November 2006, it issued a final rule
    specifying the requirements and procedures for invoking this
    backstop authority. However, both DOE’s NIETC designations
    and FERC’s final rule regarding permitting have been
    challenged and are currently subject to review in various
    federal courts. In one such case, decided in February 2009, a
    federal court of appeals vacated FERC’s interpretation of
    the scope of its backstop siting authority. Accordingly, the
    long-term effect of DOE’s NIETC designations and the
    transmission siting rules will depend on the results of the
    remaining challenges, possible further revisions to various
    federal regulations or new legislation that may more clearly
    define the scope of FERC’s transmission siting authority.



We also expect that certain provisions of the ARRA will create
    demand for our services over the long-term. This
    $787 billion economic stimulus package consists of
    approximately $506 billion in spending and approximately
    $281 billion in tax cuts and tax credits that are intended
    to create jobs and improve the economy. Several of the
    ARRA’s provisions include incentives for investments in
    renewable energy, energy efficiency and related infrastructure,
    such as the extension of certain tax incentives for renewable
    energy projects, loan guarantees for the construction of
    renewable energy systems and electric power transmission and
    funds for modernization of the electric grid. The stimulus
    package also includes funding for the deployment of high-speed
    internet to rural areas that lack sufficient bandwidth to
    adequately support economic development, as well as funding to
    states for restoration, repair and construction of highways,
    which may create the need for relocation and upgrade of electric
    power, telecommunications and natural gas infrastructure. While
    we cannot predict the timing of when investments related to
    these initiatives will occur or the scope of the investments
    that may be made, we anticipate that certain of the ARRA
    initiatives will positively impact demand for our services in
    the future.

Increased outsourcing of network infrastructure installation
    and maintenance.

We believe that electric power,
    gas, telecommunications and cable television providers are
    increasingly focusing on their core competencies, resulting in
    an increase in the outsourcing of network services. Total
    employment in the electric utility industry declined
    substantially in the last decade, reflecting, in part, the
    outsourcing trend by utilities. We believe that by outsourcing
    network services to third-party service providers such as us,
    our customers can reduce costs, provide flexibility in budgets
    and improve service and performance.

One of the largest issues facing utilities is the aging of the
    workforce. NERC estimates that approximately one in three
    utility workers will be 50 or older by 2010, yet there will be a
    25% increase in demand for electricity by 2015. Many utilities
    look to a third-party partner to help address this issue. With
    more than 14,000 employees across the nation, we believe we
    are well-positioned to provide skilled labor to supplement or
    completely outsource a utility’s workforce. As a specialty
    contractor with nationwide scope, we are able to leverage our
    existing labor force and equipment infrastructure across
    multiple customers and projects, resulting in better utilization
    of labor and assets.

Continuing opportunities in Fiber to the Premises, or FTTP,
    and Fiber to the Node, or FTTN.

We believe that
    several of the large telecommunications companies remain
    committed to the build-out of their FTTP and FTTN initiatives
    over the long-term, despite the recent slow-down in deployment.
    Initiatives for the

last-mile

fiber build-out have been announced by Verizon and AT&T as
    well as municipalities throughout the United States. At the end
    of 2008, Verizon reported that it had passed 12 million
    premises and indicated that it expects to pass 18 million
    premises with its fiber network by the end of 2010, including
    three million during 2009. This 2010 goal equates to more than
    50% of the households in Verizon’s 28-state area.

At the end of 2008, AT&T had passed 17 million
    premises with fiber that can deliver its U-verse suite of
    services, which includes internet protocol

(IP)-based

television, high-speed internet access and voice services.
    AT&T had also secured approximately one million U-verse
    customers by the end of 2008.

The fiber installed by telecommunication companies will deliver
    integrated

IP-based

television, high-speed internet and IP voice and wireless
    bundles of products and services. More than three million North
    American households have subscribed to high-speed fiber network
    services. We believe the rate of growth in fiber to the home
    connections will continue to increase as more Americans look to
    next-generation networks for faster internet and more robust
    video services, although we cannot predict the impact that the
    current economic conditions will have on the timing or amount of
    this growth.

While not all of the spending in the FTTP and FTTN initiatives
    will be for services that we provide, we believe that we are
    well-positioned to furnish infrastructure solutions for these
    initiatives throughout the United States. We expect these
    initiatives to result in an increase in demand for our
    telecommunications and underground construction services over
    the next several years, although this demand has been, and will
    likely continue to be, negatively impacted by reductions in
    spending due to the economic downturn and volatility in the
    capital markets. This impact on demand is reflected in the
    slow-down that we have seen in FTTP and FTTN deployment since
    the second quarter of 2008.



Strengths

Geographic reach and significant size and
    scale.

As a result of our nationwide operations
    and significant scale, we are able to deploy services to
    customers across the United States. This capability is
    particularly important to our customers who operate networks
    that span multiple states or regions. The scale of our
    operations also allows us to mobilize significant numbers of
    employees on short notice for emergency restoration services, as
    well as reallocate certain of our resources from declining
    markets to growth opportunities.

Strong financial profile.

Our strong liquidity
    position provides us with the flexibility to capitalize on new
    business and growth opportunities. We believe our strong
    financial condition is viewed favorably by our existing and
    potential customers and will also enable us to better navigate a
    challenging economic environment. As of December 31, 2008,
    we had cash and cash equivalents of $437.9 million, working
    capital of $929.7 million and long-term debt of
    $143.8 million. We also have a $475.0 million credit
    facility under which we had available borrowing capacity of
    $314.8 million as of December 31, 2008.

Strong and diverse customer relationships.

Our
    customer relationships extend over multiple end markets and
    include electric power, gas, telecommunications and cable
    television companies, as well as commercial, industrial and
    governmental entities. We have established a solid base of
    long-standing customer relationships by providing high quality
    services in a cost-efficient and timely manner. Many of our
    customer relationships are multi-year and, in some cases,
    decades old. We believe our strong and diverse customer
    relationships offer opportunities for future growth.

Delivery of comprehensive and diverse
    solutions.

We believe that electric power, gas,
    telecommunications and cable television companies will continue
    to seek service providers who can design, install and maintain
    their networks on a quick and reliable, yet cost effective
    basis. We are one of the few network service providers capable
    of regularly delivering complete solutions on a nationwide
    basis. As companies in the electric power, gas,
    telecommunications and cable television industries continue to
    search for service providers who can effectively design, install
    and maintain their networks, we believe that our service,
    industry and geographical breadth places us in a strong position
    to meet these needs.

Proprietary technology.

Our electric power
    customers benefit from our ability to perform services without
    interrupting power service to their customers, which we refer to
    as energized services. We hold a U.S. patent protecting our
    exclusive use through 2014 of our
    LineMaster

tm

robotic arm, which enhances our ability to deliver these
    energized services to our customers. We also hold certain
    international patents for the
    LineMaster

tm

and U.S. and international patents protecting other robotic
    arm technologies for various periods up to 2024, as well as
    U.S. and international pending patent applications for
    certain energized methodologies. We believe that delivery of
    energized services is a significant factor in differentiating us
    from our competition and winning new business. Our energized
    services workforce is specially trained to deliver these
    services and operate the
    LineMaster

tm

robotic arm.

Experienced management team.

Our executive
    management team has an average of 33 years of experience
    within the contracting industry, and our operating unit
    executives’ average over 26 years of experience in
    their respective industries.

Strategy

The key elements of our business strategy are:

Capitalize on favorable trends in certain key end
    markets.

We believe that we are well-positioned
    to capitalize on future capital spending by customers across
    certain key end markets. Our strong and diverse customer
    relationships, geographic reach and financial strength should
    allow us to benefit from investments over the long-term by,
    among others, electric power customers in transmission,
    distribution and renewable energy infrastructure.

Leverage existing customer relationships and expand services
    to drive growth.

We believe we can improve our
    rate of growth by expanding the portfolio of services and
    solutions we provide to our existing and



potential customer base. Expanding our portfolio of services
    allows us to develop, build and maintain networks on a regional,
    national and international scale and adapt to our
    customers’ changing needs. We believe that increasing our
    geographic and technological capabilities, together with
    promoting best practices and cross-selling our services to our
    customers, positions us well to capitalize upon opportunities
    and trends in the industries we serve.

Focus on expanding operating efficiencies.

We
    intend to continue to:

•

focus on growth in our more profitable services and on projects
    that have higher margins;

•

adjust our costs to match the level of demand for our services;

•

combine overlapping operations of certain operating units;

•

share pricing and bidding methodologies, technology, equipment
    and best practices among our operating units; and

•

develop and expand the use of management information systems.

Pursue strategic acquisitions.

We continue to
    evaluate potential acquisitions of companies with strong
    management teams and good reputations to broaden our customer
    base, expand our geographic area of operation and grow our
    portfolio of services. During 2007 and 2008 and from 1998
    through 2000, we grew significantly through acquisitions. We
    believe that attractive acquisition candidates still exist as a
    result of the highly fragmented nature of the industry, the
    inability of many companies to expand and modernize due to
    capital constraints and the desire of owners of acquisition
    candidates for liquidity. We also believe that our financial
    strength and experienced management team will be attractive to
    acquisition candidates.

Pursue new business opportunities.

We
    continuously leverage our core expertise and pursue new business
    opportunities, including renewable energy projects, gas
    gathering and pipeline installations and in the government and
    international arenas. In connection with renewable energy
    projects, we have the capabilities to design, install and
    maintain the facilities as well as provide connectivity to the
    grid. We also believe that we are well-positioned to participate
    in power and communications infrastructure projects for the
    public sector and overseas.

Expand our dark fiber network.

We intend to
    continue to expand our dark fiber network in select markets.
    Approximately $85.0 million of our capital spending for
    2009 is targeted for the expansion of our dark fiber network.

Financial
    Information about Geographic Areas

We operate primarily in the United States; however, we derived
    $53.6 million, $71.5 million and $98.8 million of
    our revenues from foreign operations, the majority of which was
    earned in Canada, during the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2007 and 2008, respectively. In addition, we held property and
    equipment in the amount of $6.0 million, $9.0 million
    and $6.5 million in foreign countries as of
    December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.

Our business, financial condition and results of operations in
    foreign countries may be adversely impacted by monetary and
    fiscal policies, currency fluctuations, energy shortages,
    regulatory requirements and other political, social and economic
    developments or instability.

Customers,
    Strategic Alliances and Preferred Provider
    Relationships

Our customers include electric power, gas, telecommunications
    and cable television companies, as well as commercial,
    industrial and governmental entities. Our 10 largest customers
    accounted for 30.3% of our consolidated revenues during the year
    ended December 31, 2008. Our largest customer accounted for
    approximately 4.4% of our consolidated revenues for the year
    ended December 31, 2008.

Although we have a centralized marketing strategy, management at
    each of our operating units is responsible for developing and
    maintaining successful long-term relationships with customers.
    Our operating unit management teams build upon existing customer
    relationships to secure additional projects and increase revenue
    from our current customer base. Many of these customer
    relationships originated decades ago and are maintained through
    a partnering approach to account management that includes
    project evaluation and consulting, quality performance,
    performance measurement and direct customer contact. On an
    operating unit level, management maintains a parallel focus on
    pursuing growth opportunities with prospective customers. We
    continue to encourage operating unit management to cross-sell
    services of other operating units to their customers. In
    addition, our business development group promotes and markets
    our services for prospective large national accounts and
    projects that would require services from multiple operating
    units.

We strive to maintain our status as a preferred vendor to our
    customers. Many of our customers and prospective customers
    maintain a list of preferred vendors with whom the customer
    enters into a formal contractual agreement as a result of a
    request-for-proposal process. As a preferred vendor, we have met



minimum standards for a specific category of service, maintain a
    high level of performance and agree to certain payment terms and
    negotiated rates.

We believe that our strategic relationships with large providers
    of electric power and telecommunications services will continue
    to result in future opportunities. Many of these strategic
    relationships take the form of a strategic alliance or long-term
    maintenance agreement. Strategic alliance agreements generally
    state an intention to work together and many provide us with
    preferential bidding procedures. Strategic alliances and
    long-term maintenance agreements are typically agreements for an
    initial term of approximately two to four years that may include
    an option to add extensions at the end of the initial term.
    Certain of our strategic alliance and long-term maintenance
    agreements are “evergreen” contracts with exclusivity
    clauses providing that we will be awarded all contracts, or a
    right of first refusal, for a certain type of work or work in a
    certain geographic region.

Backlog

Backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to
    realize from work to be performed in the future on uncompleted
    contracts, including new contractual agreements on which work
    has not begun. Our backlog at December 31, 2006 was
    approximately $1.48 billion based only on work expected to
    be performed over the next twelve months. At that time, we did
    not include estimated revenues beyond twelve months in our
    calculations. Our total backlog at December 31, 2007 was
    approximately $4.67 billion, of which $2.36 billion
    was expected to be realized over the next twelve months, while
    our total backlog at December 31, 2008 was approximately
    $5.19 billion, of which $2.58 billion is expected to
    be realized over the next twelve months.

The backlog estimates above include amounts under long-term
    maintenance contracts in addition to construction contracts. We
    determine the amount of work under long-term maintenance
    contracts, or master service agreements (MSAs), to be disclosed
    as backlog as the estimate of future work to be performed by
    using recurring historical trends inherent in the current MSAs,
    factoring in seasonal demand and projected customer needs based
    upon ongoing communications with the customer. In many
    instances, our customers are not contractually committed to
    specific volumes of services under our MSAs, and many of our
    contracts may be terminated with notice. There can be no
    assurance as to our customer’s requirements or that our
    estimates are accurate. In addition, many of our MSAs, as well
    as contracts for dark fiber leasing, are subject to renewal
    options. For purposes of calculating backlog, we have included
    future renewal options only to the extent the renewals can
    reasonably be expected to occur.

Competition

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We
    compete with other contractors in most of the geographic markets
    in which we operate, and several of our competitors are large
    domestic companies that have significant financial, technical
    and marketing resources. In addition, there are relatively few
    barriers to entry into some of the industries in which we
    operate and, as a result, any organization that has adequate
    financial resources and access to technical expertise may become
    a competitor. A significant portion of our revenues is currently
    derived from unit price or fixed price agreements, and price is
    often an important factor in the award of such agreements.
    Accordingly, we could be underbid by our competitors in an
    effort by them to procure such business. We believe that as
    demand for our services increases, customers will increasingly
    consider other factors in choosing a service provider, including
    technical expertise and experience, financial and operational
    resources, nationwide presence, industry reputation and
    dependability, which we expect to benefit larger contractors
    such as us. There can be no assurance, however, that our
    competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and
    resources to provide services that are superior in both price
    and quality to our services, or that we will be able to maintain
    or enhance our competitive position. We may also face
    competition from the in-house service organizations of our
    existing or prospective customers, including electric power,
    gas, telecommunications, cable television and engineering
    companies, which employ personnel who perform some of the same
    types of services as those provided by us. Although a
    significant portion of these services is currently outsourced by
    our customers, there can be no assurance that our existing or
    prospective customers will continue to outsource services in the
    future.



Employees

As of December 31, 2008, we had 2,117 salaried employees,
    including executive officers, professional and administrative
    staff, project managers and engineers, job superintendents and
    clerical personnel, and 12,634 hourly employees, the number
    of which fluctuates depending upon the number and size of the
    projects we undertake at any particular time. Approximately 45%
    of our hourly employees at December 31, 2008 were covered
    by collective bargaining agreements with certain of our
    subsidiaries, primarily with the International Brotherhood of
    Electrical Workers (IBEW). These collective bargaining
    agreements require the payment of specified wages to our union
    employees, the observance of certain workplace rules and the
    payment of certain amounts to multi-employer pension plans and
    employee benefit trusts rather than administering the funds on
    behalf of these employees. These collective bargaining
    agreements have varying terms and expiration dates. The majority
    of the collective bargaining agreements contain provisions that
    prohibit work stoppages or strikes, even during specified
    negotiation periods relating to agreement renewal, and provide
    for binding arbitration dispute resolution in the event of
    prolonged disagreement.

We provide health, welfare and benefit plans for employees who
    are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have a
    401(k) plan pursuant to which eligible employees who are not
    provided retirement benefits through a collective bargaining
    agreement may make contributions through a payroll deduction. We
    make matching cash contributions of 100% of each employee’s
    contribution up to 3% of that employee’s salary and 50% of
    each employee’s contribution between 3% and 6% of such
    employee’s salary, up to the maximum amount permitted by
    law.

Our industry is experiencing a shortage of journeyman linemen in
    certain geographic areas. In response to the shortage, we seek
    to take advantage of various IBEW and National Electrical
    Contractors Association (NECA) training programs and support the
    joint IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program which trains qualified
    electrical workers. We have also established apprenticeship
    training programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor
    for employees not subject to the IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship
    Program, as well as additional company-wide and project-specific
    employee training and educational programs.

We believe our relationships with our employees and union
    representatives are good.

Materials

Our customers typically supply most or all of the materials
    required for each job. However, for some of our contracts, we
    may procure all or part of the materials required. We purchase
    such materials from a variety of sources and do not anticipate
    experiencing any difficulties in procuring such materials.

Training,
    Quality Assurance and Safety

Performance of our services requires the use of equipment and
    exposure to conditions that can be dangerous. Although we are
    committed to a policy of operating safely and prudently, we have
    been and will continue to be subject to claims by employees,
    customers and third parties for property damage and personal
    injuries resulting from performance of our services. Our
    operating units have established comprehensive safety policies,
    procedures and regulations and require that employees complete
    prescribed training and service programs prior to performing
    more sophisticated and technical jobs, which is in addition to
    those programs required, if applicable, by the IBEW/NECA
    Apprenticeship Program or our equivalent programs. Under the
    IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program, all journeyman linemen are
    required to complete a minimum of 7,000 hours of on-the-job
    training, approximately 200 hours of classroom education
    and extensive testing and certification. Certain of our
    operating units have established apprenticeship training
    programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor that
    prescribe equivalent training requirements for employees who are
    not otherwise subject to the requirements of the IBEW/NECA
    Apprenticeship Program. Our operating units also benefit from
    sharing best practices regarding their training and educational
    programs and comprehensive safety policies and regulations.



Regulation

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and
    international laws and regulations including:

•

licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to
    electricians and engineers;

•

building and electrical codes;

•

permitting and inspection requirements applicable to
    construction projects;

•

regulations relating to worker safety and environmental
    protection;

•

telecommunication regulations affecting our dark fiber licensing
    business; and

•

special bidding, procurement and other requirements on
    government projects.

We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our
    operations and that we are in substantial compliance with
    applicable regulatory requirements. Our failure to comply with
    applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or
    revocation of our operating licenses.

Environmental
    Matters

We are committed to the protection of the environment and train
    our employees to perform their duties accordingly. We are
    subject to numerous federal, state, local and international
    environmental laws and regulations governing our operations,
    including the handling, transportation and disposal of
    non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as
    emissions and discharges into the environment, including
    discharges to air, surface water and groundwater and soil. We
    also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability
    and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances
    into the environment. Under certain of these laws and
    regulations, such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of
    previously owned or operated properties, or properties to which
    hazardous substances or wastes were sent by current or former
    operations at our facilities, regardless of whether we directly
    caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of
    discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such
    substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or
    adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or use our
    properties as collateral for financing. In addition, we could be
    held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain
    environmental laws and regulations and also could be subject to
    a revocation of our licenses or permits, which could materially
    and adversely affect our business and results of operations.

From time to time, we may incur costs and obligations for
    correcting environmental noncompliance matters and for
    remediation at or relating to certain of our properties. We
    believe we are in substantial compliance with our environmental
    obligations to date and that any such obligations will not have
    a material adverse effect on our business or financial
    performance.

Risk
    Management and Insurance

We are insured for employer’s liability claims, subject to
    a deductible of $1.0 million per occurrence, and for
    general liability and auto liability subject to a deductible of
    $3.0 million per occurrence. We are also insured for
    workers’ compensation claims, subject to a deductible of
    $2.0 million per occurrence. Additionally, we are subject
    to an annual cumulative aggregate liability of up to
    $1.0 million on workers’ compensation claims in excess
    of $2.0 million per occurrence. We also have employee
    health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is
    subject to a deductible of $350,000 per claimant per year.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported
    and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
    assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance
    liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
    factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination
    of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of
    incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety
    program. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical
    trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate. As
    of December 31, 2007 and 2008, the gross amount accrued for
    insurance claims totaled $152.0 million and
    $147.9 million, with



$110.1 million and $105.0 million considered to be
    long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Related
    insurance recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2007
    and 2008 were $22.1 million and $12.5 million, of
    which $11.9 million and $7.2 million are included in
    prepaid expenses and other current assets and $10.2 million
    and $5.3 million are included in other assets, net.

Our casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods from
    August 1, 2000 to February 28, 2003 has experienced
    financial distress. Effective September 29, 2008, Quanta
    consummated a novation transaction that released this distressed
    casualty insurance carrier from all further obligations in
    connection with the policies in effect during that period in
    exchange for the payment to us of an agreed amount. Our current
    casualty insurance carrier assumed all obligations under the
    policies in effect during that period; however, we are obligated
    to indemnify the carrier in full for any liabilities under the
    policies assumed. At December 31, 2008, we estimate that
    the total future claim amounts associated with the novated
    policies was $6.8 million, based on an estimate of the
    potential range of these future claim amounts at
    December 31, 2008 of between $2.0 million and
    $8.0 million. The actual amounts ultimately paid by us in
    connection with these claims, if any, could vary materially from
    the above range and could be impacted by further claims
    development.

Seasonality
    and Cyclicality

Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to
    seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced
    by weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, project
    schedules and timing and holidays. Typically, our revenues are
    lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or
    wet conditions cause delays. The second quarter is typically
    better than the first, as some projects begin, but continued
    cold and wet weather can often impact second quarter
    productivity. The third quarter is typically the best of the
    year, as a greater number of projects are underway and weather
    is more accommodating to work on projects. Revenues during the
    fourth quarter of the year are typically lower than the third
    quarter but higher than the second quarter. Many projects are
    completed in the fourth quarter and revenues often are impacted
    positively by customers seeking to spend their capital budget
    before the end of the year; however, the holiday season and
    inclement weather sometimes can cause delays and thereby reduce
    revenues and increase costs.

Working capital needs are generally higher during the summer and
    fall months due to increased construction in weather affected
    regions of the country. Conversely, working capital assets are
    typically converted to cash during the winter months.

Additionally, our industry can be highly cyclical. As a result,
    our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines or
    delays in new projects in various geographic regions in the
    United States. Project schedules, in particular in connection
    with larger, longer-term projects, can also create fluctuations
    in the services provided under projects, which may adversely
    affect us in a given quarter. The financial condition of our
    customers and their access to capital, variations in the margins
    of projects performed during any particular quarter, regional,
    national and global economic and market conditions, timing of
    acquisitions, the timing and magnitude of acquisition
    assimilation costs, interest rate fluctuations and other factors
    may also materially affect our quarterly results. Accordingly,
    our operating results in any particular quarter or year may not
    be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other
    quarter or for any other year. An investor should read

    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” for additional
    discussion of trends and challenges that may affect our
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

    including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties
    described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are
    not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not known to us or not described below also may
    impair our business operations. If any of the following risks
    actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of
    operations could be harmed and we may not be able to achieve our
    goals. This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

also includes statements reflecting assumptions, expectations,
    projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are
    intended as “forward-looking statements” under the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be

“Uncertainty of Forward-Looking Statements and
    Information”

included in Item 7
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.”

Our
    operating results may vary significantly from quarter to
    quarter.

We typically experience lower gross and operating margins during
    winter months due to lower demand for our services and more
    difficult operating conditions. Additionally, our quarterly
    results may be materially and adversely affected by:

•

variations in the margins of projects performed during any
    particular quarter;

•

unfavorable regional, national or global economic and market
    conditions;

•

a reduction in the demand for our services;

•

the budgetary spending patterns of customers;

•

increases in construction and design costs;

•

the timing and volume of work we perform;

•

the termination of existing agreements;

•

losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by
    insurance;

•

a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;

•

payment risk associated with the financial condition of our
    customers;

•

changes in bonding and lien requirements applicable to existing
    and new agreements;

•

implementation of various information systems, which could
    temporarily disrupt day-to-day operations;

•

the recognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax
    positions;

•

decreases in interest rates we receive on our cash and cash
    equivalents;

•

changes in accounting pronouncements which require us to account
    for items differently than historical pronouncements have;



•

costs we incur to support growth internally or through
    acquisitions or otherwise;

•

the timing and integration of acquisitions; and

•

the timing and magnitude of acquisition costs, integration costs
    and potential goodwill impairments.

Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may
    not be indicative of the results that you can expect for any
    other quarter or for the entire year.

The
    recent economic downturn and the financial and credit crisis may
    adversely impact our customers’ future spending as well as
    payment for our services and, as a result, our operations and
    growth.

The growth in economic activity has slowed substantially, and
    the U.S. economy is in a recessionary period. It is
    uncertain when these conditions will improve. Stagnant or
    declining economic conditions may adversely impact the demand
    for our services and potentially result in the delay, reduction
    or cancellation of projects. Many of our customers finance their
    projects through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of
    debt or the issuance of equity. The credit markets have also
    declined, and the availability of credit is constrained.
    Additionally, many of our customers’ equity values have
    substantially declined. A reduction in cash flow and the lack of
    availability of debt or equity financing may result in a
    reduction in our customers’ spending for our services and
    may also impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed
    to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    operations and our ability to grow at historical levels.

An
    economic downturn in any of the industries we serve may lead to
    less demand for our services.

Because the vast majority of our revenue is derived from a few
    industries, a downturn in any of those industries would
    adversely affect our results of operations. Specifically, an
    economic downturn in any industry we serve could result in the
    delay, reduction or cancellation of projects by our customers as
    well as cause our customers to outsource less work, resulting in
    decreased demand for our services. The telecommunications and
    utility markets experienced substantial change during 2002 and
    2003 as evidenced by an increased number of bankruptcies in the
    telecommunications market, continued devaluation of many of our
    customers’ debt and equity securities and pricing pressures
    resulting from challenges faced by major industry participants.
    These factors contributed to the delay and cancellation of
    projects and reduction of capital spending, which impacted our
    operations and our ability to grow at historical levels. A
    number of other factors, including financing conditions and
    potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve or a prolonged
    economic downturn or recession, could adversely affect our
    customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital
    expenditures in the future or pay for past services. Recently,
    our telecommunications and cable operations have been negatively
    impacted by reductions in spending due to the economic downturn
    and volatility in the capital markets. We have seen a
    significant slow-down in FTTP and FTTN deployment from customers
    such as AT&T and Verizon since the second quarter of 2008,
    and we anticipate this slow-down will likely continue if
    economic conditions remain stagnant or further deteriorate. We
    have also seen reduced spending in electric distribution due to
    capital expenditure reductions. Additionally, our gas
    distribution installation business, which is driven in part by
    the housing construction market, has decreased, and continued
    declines in new housing construction could cause further
    reductions in this business. Another area of our natural gas
    business — gas gathering and pipeline installation and
    maintenance — has also declined, which we believe is
    due to lower natural gas prices and capital constraints on
    spending by our customers. Consolidation, competition, capital
    constraints or negative economic conditions in the electric
    power, gas, telecommunications or cable television industries
    may also result in reduced spending by, or the loss of, one or
    more of our customers.

Project
    delays or cancellations may result in additional costs to us,
    reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated
    damages.

In certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion by a
    scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance
    and performance testing levels. Failure to meet any of those
    schedules or performance requirements could result in additional
    costs or penalties, including liquidated damages, and such
    amounts could exceed expected project profit. Many projects
    involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction
    phases that may occur over extended time periods, sometimes over
    several years. We may



encounter difficulties in engineering, delays in designs or
    materials provided by the customer or a third party, equipment
    and material delivery, schedule changes, delays from our
    customer’s failure to timely obtain rights-of-way,
    weather-related delays and other factors, some of which are
    beyond our control, that impact our ability to complete the
    project in accordance with the original delivery schedule. For
    example, the recent increase in demand for transmission services
    has strained production resources, creating significant lead
    times for obtaining large transformers, transmission towers and
    poles. As a result, electric transmission project revenues could
    be significantly reduced or delayed due to the difficulty we or
    our customers may experience in obtaining required materials. In
    addition, we occasionally contract with third-party
    subcontractors to assist us with the completion of contracts.
    Any delay by suppliers or by subcontractors in the completion of
    their portion of the project, or any failure by a subcontractor
    to satisfactorily complete its portion of the project may result
    in delays in the overall progress of the project or may cause us
    to incur additional costs, or both. We also may encounter
    project delays due to local opposition, which may include
    injunctive actions as well as public protests, to the siting of
    transmission lines or other facilities.

Delays and additional costs may be substantial and, in some
    cases, we may be required to compensate the customer for such
    delays. We may not be able to recover all of such costs. In
    extreme cases, the above-mentioned factors could cause project
    cancellations, and we may not be able to replace such projects
    with similar projects or at all. Such delays or cancellations
    may impact our reputation or relationships with customers,
    adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts.

Project contracts may require customers or other parties to
    provide the design, engineering information, equipment or
    materials to be used on a project. In some cases, the project
    schedule or the design, engineering information, equipment or
    materials may be deficient or delivered later than required by
    the project schedule. Our customers may change or delay various
    elements of the project after its commencement, resulting in
    additional direct or indirect costs. Under these circumstances,
    we generally negotiate with the customer with respect to the
    amount of additional time required and the compensation to be
    paid to us. We are subject to the risk that we may be unable to
    obtain, through negotiation, arbitration, litigation or
    otherwise, adequate amounts to compensate us for the additional
    work or expenses incurred by us due to customer-requested change
    orders or failure by the customer to timely deliver items, such
    as engineering drawings or materials, required to be provided by
    the customer. Litigation or arbitration of claims for
    compensation may be lengthy and costly, and it is often
    difficult to predict when and for how much the claims will be
    resolved. A failure to obtain adequate compensation for these
    matters could require us to record a reduction to amounts of
    revenue and gross profit recognized in prior periods under the
    percentage-of-completion accounting method. Any such adjustments
    could be substantial. We may also be required to invest
    significant working capital to fund cost overruns while the
    resolution of claims is pending, which could adversely affect
    liquidity and financial results in any given period.

We may
    be unsuccessful at generating internal growth.

Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by,
    among other factors, our ability to:

•

expand the range of services we offer to customers to address
    their evolving network needs;

•

attract new customers;

•

increase the number of projects performed for existing customers;

•

hire and retain qualified employees;

•

expand geographically, including internationally, and

•

address the challenges presented by difficult economic or market
    conditions that may affect us or our customers.

In addition, our customers may delay, reduce or cancel the
    number or size of projects available to us due to their
    inability to obtain capital or pay for services provided, the
    risk of which has become heightened in light of the recent
    economic downturn. Many of the factors affecting our ability to
    generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we
    cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that
    we will be



able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and
    to support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not
    be able to achieve internal growth of our business or expand our
    operations.

Our
    use of fixed price contracts could adversely affect our
    business.

We currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a
    portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. We must
    estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for
    fixed price contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials,
    however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated. These
    variations, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed
    price contracts, may cause actual revenue and gross profits for
    a project to differ from those we originally estimated and could
    result in reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending
    upon the size of a particular project, variations from the
    estimated contract costs could have a significant impact on our
    operating results for any fiscal quarter or year.

Our
    use of percentage-of-completion accounting could result in a
    reduction or elimination of previously reported
    profits.

As discussed in Item 7

“Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Critical Accounting Policies”

and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements
    included in Item 8 hereof, a significant portion of our
    revenues are recognized using the percentage-of-completion
    method of accounting, utilizing the cost-to-cost method. This
    method is used because management considers expended costs to be
    the best available measure of progress on these contracts. This
    accounting method is generally accepted for fixed price
    contracts. The percentage-of-completion accounting practice we
    use results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings
    ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence
    of contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on
    individual contracts are based on estimates of contract
    revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses are
    recognized in full when determined to be probable and reasonably
    estimatable, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on
    ongoing reviews of contract profitability. Further, a
    substantial portion of our contracts contain various cost and
    performance incentives. Penalties are recorded when known or
    finalized, which generally occurs during the latter stages of
    the contract. In addition, we record cost recovery claims when
    we believe recovery is probable and the amounts can be
    reasonably estimated. Actual collection of claims could differ
    from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or
    elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain
    circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be
    significant.

Our
    industry is highly competitive.

Our industry is served by numerous small, owner-operated private
    companies, some public companies and several large regional
    companies. In addition, relatively few barriers prevent entry
    into some of our industries. As a result, any organization that
    has adequate financial resources and access to technical
    expertise may become one of our competitors. Competition in the
    industry depends on a number of factors, including price.
    Certain of our competitors may have lower overhead cost
    structures and, therefore, may be able to provide their services
    at lower rates than we are able to provide. In addition, some of
    our competitors have significant resources including financial,
    technical and marketing resources. We cannot be certain that our
    competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and
    resources to provide services that are superior in both price
    and quality to our services. Similarly, we cannot be certain
    that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive
    position within our industry or maintain our customer base at
    current levels. We also may face competition from the in-house
    service organizations of our existing or prospective customers.
    Electric power, gas, telecommunications and cable television
    service providers usually employ personnel who perform some of
    the same types of services we do. We cannot be certain that our
    existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource
    services in the future.

Legislative
    actions and incentives relating to electric power and renewable
    energy may fail to result in increased demand for our
    services.

Implementation of the Energy Act is still subject to
    considerable fiscal and regulatory uncertainty. Regulations
    implementing the components of the Energy Act that may affect
    demand for our services remain



in some cases subject to review in various federal courts. In
    one such case, decided in February 2009, a federal court of
    appeals vacated FERC’s interpretation of the scope of its
    backstop siting authority. Accordingly, the effect of these
    regulations, once finally implemented, is uncertain. As a
    result, the legislation may not result in increased spending on
    the electric power transmission infrastructure. Continued
    uncertainty regarding the implementation of the Energy Act may
    result in slower growth in demand for our services. In addition,
    changes to energy regulatory policy may be forthcoming due to
    the new administration.

Demand for our services also may not result from renewable
    energy initiatives or the ARRA. While 30 states currently
    have mandates in place that require certain percentages of power
    to be generated from renewable sources, states could reduce
    those mandates or make them optional, which would reduce, delay
    or eliminate renewable energy development in the affected
    states. Additionally, renewable energy is generally more
    expensive to produce and may require additional power generation
    sources as backup. The locations of renewable energy projects
    are often remote and are not viable unless connectivity to the
    grid to transport the power to demand centers is economically
    feasible. Furthermore, funding for renewable energy initiatives
    may not be available, which may be further constrained as a
    result of turbulent credit markets. These factors could result
    in fewer renewable energy projects than anticipated or a delay
    in the timing of construction of these projects and the related
    infrastructure, which would negatively affect the demand for our
    services. In addition, we cannot predict when programs under the
    ARRA will be implemented or the timing and scope of any
    investments to be made under these programs. Investments for
    renewable energy, electric power infrastructure and
    telecommunications fiber deployment under ARRA programs may not
    occur, may be less than anticipated or may be delayed, which
    would negatively impact demand for our services.

Many
    of our contracts may be canceled on short notice or may not be
    renewed upon completion or expiration, and we may be
    unsuccessful in replacing our contracts in such
    events.

We could experience a decrease in our revenue, net income and
    liquidity if any of the following occur:

•

our customers cancel a significant number of contracts or
    contracts having significant value;

•

we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts
    upon re-bid;

•

we complete a significant number of non-recurring projects and
    cannot replace them with similar projects; or

•

we fail to reduce operating and overhead expenses consistent
    with any decrease in our revenue.

Many of our customers may cancel our contracts on short notice,
    typically

30-90 days,

even if we are not in default under the contract. Certain of our
    customers assign work to us on a

project-by-project

basis under master service agreements. Under these agreements,
    our customers often have no obligation to assign a specific
    amount of work to us. Our operations could decline significantly
    if the anticipated volume of work is not assigned to us, which
    may be more likely if customer spending decreases, for example,
    due to the economic downturn. Many of our contracts, including
    our master service agreements, are opened to public bid at the
    expiration of their terms. There can be no assurance that we
    will be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that
    come up for re-bid.

Our
    business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and
    retain qualified employees.

Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will
    be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled
    personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We cannot be
    certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled
    labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our
    growth strategy. For instance, we may experience shortages of
    qualified journeyman linemen. In addition, we cannot be certain
    that our labor expenses will not increase as a result of a
    shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel. Labor
    shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to
    maintain our business or grow our revenues.



Backlog
    may not be realized or may not result in profits.

Backlog is difficult to determine with certainty. Customers
    often have no obligation under our contracts to assign or
    release work to us, and many contracts may be terminated on
    short notice. Reductions in backlog due to cancellation of one
    or more contracts by a customer or for other reasons could
    significantly reduce the revenue and profit we actually receive
    from contracts included in backlog. In the event of a project
    cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but
    typically have no contractual right to the total revenues
    reflected in our backlog. The backlog we obtain in connection
    with any companies we acquire may not be as large as we believed
    or may not result in the revenue or profits we expected. In
    addition, projects may remain in backlog for extended periods of
    time. All of these uncertainties are heightened as a result of
    negative economic conditions and their impact on our
    customers’ spending. Consequently, we cannot assure you
    that our estimates of backlog are accurate or that we will be
    able to realize our estimated backlog.

Our
    financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that
    may differ from actual results.

In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States, several estimates and assumptions are used by management
    in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented
    and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to
    exist as of the date of the financial statements. These
    estimates and assumptions must be made because certain
    information that is used in the preparation of our financial
    statements is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated
    with a high degree of precision from data available or is not
    capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted
    methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly
    difficult to determine and we must exercise significant
    judgment. Estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful
    lives of property and equipment, fair value assumptions in
    analyzing goodwill and long-lived asset impairments,
    self-insured claims liabilities, forfeiture estimates relating
    to stock-based compensation, revenue recognition under
    percentage-of-completion accounting and provision for income
    taxes. Actual results for all estimates could differ materially
    from the estimates and assumptions that we use, which could have
    a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

Factors
    beyond our control may affect our ability to successfully
    execute our acquisition strategy, which may have an adverse
    impact on our growth strategy.

Our business strategy includes expanding our presence in the
    industries we serve through strategic acquisitions of companies
    that complement or enhance our business. We expect to face
    competition for acquisition opportunities, and some of our
    competitors may have access to financing on more favorable terms
    than us or have greater financial resources. This competition
    may limit our acquisition opportunities and our ability to grow
    through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions
    and make them less accretive or possibly non-accretive to us.
    Acquisitions that we may pursue may also involve significant
    cash expenditures, debt incurrence or the issuance of
    securities. Any acquisition may ultimately have a negative
    impact on our business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

We may
    be unsuccessful at integrating companies that either we have
    acquired or that we may acquire in the future.

As a part of our business strategy, we have acquired, and seek
    to acquire in the future, companies that complement or enhance
    our business. However, we cannot be sure that we will be able to
    successfully integrate each of these companies with our existing
    operations without substantial costs, delays or other
    operational or financial problems. If we do not implement proper
    overall business controls, our decentralized operating strategy
    could result in inconsistent operating and financial practices
    at the companies we acquire and our overall profitability could
    be adversely affected. Integrating our acquired companies
    involves a number of special risks which could have a negative
    impact on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations, including:

•

failure of acquired companies to achieve the results we expect;



•

diversion of our management’s attention from operational
    and other matters;

•

difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of
    acquired companies;

•

inability to retain key personnel of acquired companies;

•

risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities;

•

loss of business due to customer overlap;

•

risks arising from the prior operations of acquired companies,
    such as performance, safety or workforce issues; and

•

potential disruptions of our business.

If one of our acquired companies suffers or has suffered
    customer dissatisfaction, performance problems or operational
    issues, the reputation of our entire company could suffer.

Our
    results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of
    goodwill impairments.

When we acquire a business, we record an asset called
    “goodwill” equal to the excess amount we pay for the
    business, including liabilities assumed, over the fair value of
    the tangible and intangible assets of the business we acquire.
    For example, in connection with the Merger, we recorded
    approximately $973.1 million in goodwill and
    $158.8 million of intangible assets based on the
    application of purchase accounting. Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 provides that goodwill
    and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives
    not be amortized, but instead be tested at least annually for
    impairment, and intangible assets that have finite useful lives
    continue to be amortized over their useful lives.
    SFAS No. 142 provides specific guidance for testing
    goodwill and other

non-amortized

intangible assets for impairment. SFAS No. 142
    requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions
    when allocating goodwill to reporting units and determining the
    fair value of a reporting unit’s net assets and
    liabilities, including, among other things, an assessment of
    market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, cost
    of capital and growth rates, which could significantly impact
    the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair
    value is determined using a combination of the discounted cash
    flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation
    approaches. Absent any impairment indicators, we perform our
    impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter. If there is
    a decrease in market capitalization below book value in the
    future, this may be considered an impairment indicator. As part
    of our 2006 annual test for goodwill impairment, goodwill in the
    amount of $56.8 million was written off as a non-cash
    operating expense associated with a decrease in the expected
    future demand for the services of one of our businesses, which
    has historically served the cable television industry. Any
    future impairments, including impairments of the goodwill or
    intangible assets recorded in connection with the Merger, would
    negatively impact our results of operations for the period in
    which the impairment is recognized.

Our
    profitability and financial operations may be negatively
    affected by changes in, or interpretations of, existing state or
    federal telecommunications regulations or new regulations that
    could adversely affect our Dark Fiber segment.

In connection with the Merger, we acquired InfraSource’s
    dark fiber licensing business. Many of the dark fiber customers
    benefit from the Universal Service

“E-rate”

program, which was established by Congress in the 1996
    Telecommunications Act and is administered by the Universal
    Service Administrative Company (USAC) under the oversight of the
    Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Under the

E-rate

program, schools, libraries and certain health-care facilities
    may receive subsidies for certain approved telecommunications
    services, internet access and internal connections. From time to
    time, bills have been introduced in Congress that would
    eliminate or curtail the

E-rate

program. Passage of such actions by the FCC or USAC to further
    limit

E-rate

subsidies could decrease the demand for telecommunications
    infrastructure services by certain customers.

The telecommunications services we provide through our dark
    fiber licensing business are subject to regulation by the FCC,
    to the extent that they are interstate telecommunications
    services, and by state



regulatory agencies, when wholly within a particular state. To
    remain eligible to provide services under the

E-rate

program, we must maintain telecommunications authorizations in
    every state where we operate, and we must obtain such
    authorizations in any new state where we plan to operate.
    Changes in federal or state regulations could reduce the
    profitability of our dark fiber licensing business, and delays
    in obtaining new authorizations could inhibit our ability to
    grow our dark fiber business in new geographic areas. We could
    be subject to fines if the FCC or a state regulatory agency were
    to determine that any of our activities or positions are not in
    compliance with certain regulations. If the profitability of our
    dark fiber licensing business were to decline, or if this
    business were to become subject to fines, our results of
    operations could also be adversely affected.

Our
    dark fiber licensing business is capital intensive and requires
    a substantial investment before returns can be
    realized.

Our dark fiber licensing business requires substantial amounts
    of capital investment to build out new fiber networks. In 2009,
    our proposed capital expenditures for our dark fiber licensing
    business is approximately $85.0 million, $70.9 million
    of which is related to committed licensing arrangements as of
    December 31, 2008. Although we do not commit capital to new
    networks until we have a committed license arrangement in place
    with at least one customer, we may not be able to recoup our
    initial investment in the network if that customer defaults on
    its commitment. Even if the customer does not default or we add
    additional customers to the network, we still may not realize a
    return on the capital investment for an extended period of time.
    Additionally, new or developing technologies could negatively
    impact our dark fiber licensing business. If any of the above
    events occur, it could result in an impairment of our dark fiber
    network.

We
    extend credit to customers for purchases of our services, and in
    the past we have had, and in the future we may have, difficulty
    collecting receivables from major customers that have filed for
    bankruptcy or are otherwise experiencing financial
    difficulties.

We grant credit, generally without collateral, to our customers,
    which include electric power and gas companies,
    telecommunications and cable television system operators,
    governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners
    and managers of commercial and industrial properties located
    primarily in the United States. Consequently, we are subject to
    potential credit risk related to changes in business and
    economic factors throughout the United States. In the past, our
    customers in the telecommunications business have experienced
    significant financial difficulties and in several instances have
    filed for bankruptcy. A number of our utility customers have
    also experienced financial and business challenges in the past.
    In addition, some of our customers are currently experiencing
    financial difficulties as a result of the recent economic
    downturn. If additional major customers file for bankruptcy or
    continue to experience financial difficulties, or if anticipated
    recoveries relating to receivables in existing bankruptcies or
    other workout situations fail to materialize, we could
    experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current
    allowances provided. In addition, material changes in any of our
    customer’s revenues or cash flows could affect our ability
    to collect amounts due from them.

We are
    self-insured against potential liabilities.

Although we maintain insurance policies with respect to
    employer’s liability, general liability, automobile and
    workers’ compensation claims, those policies are subject to
    deductibles ranging from $1.0 million to $3.0 million
    per occurrence depending on the insurance policy. We are
    primarily self-insured for all claims that do not exceed the
    amount of the applicable deductible. Additionally, we are
    subject to an annual cumulative aggregate liability of up to
    $1.0 million on workers’ compensation claims in excess
    of $2.0 million per occurrence. We also have employee
    health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is
    subject to a deductible of $350,000 per claimant per year.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported
    and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
    assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance
    liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
    factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination
    of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number



of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety
    program. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical
    trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate. If
    we were to experience insurance claims or costs significantly
    above our estimates, our results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected in a given period.

Our casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods from
    August 1, 2000 to February 28, 2003 has experienced
    financial distress. Effective September 29, 2008, Quanta
    consummated a novation transaction that released this distressed
    casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods August 1,
    2000 to February 28, 2003 from all further obligations in
    connection with the policies in effect during that period in
    exchange for the payment to us of an agreed amount. Our current
    casualty insurance carrier assumed all obligations under the
    policies in effect during that period; however, we are obligated
    to indemnify the carrier in full for any liabilities under the
    policies assumed. At December 31, 2008, we estimated that
    the total future claim amounts associated with the novated
    policies was $6.8 million, based on an estimate of the
    potential range of these future claim amounts at
    December 31, 2008 of between $2.0 million and
    $8.0 million. The actual amounts ultimately paid by us in
    connection with these claims, if any, could vary materially from
    the above range and could be impacted by further claims
    development.

Our
    unionized workforce and related obligations could adversely
    affect our operations.

As of December 31, 2008, approximately 45% of our hourly
    employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements.
    Although the majority of these agreements prohibit strikes and
    work stoppages, we cannot be certain that strikes or work
    stoppages will not occur in the future. Strikes or work
    stoppages would adversely impact our relationships with our
    customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease our
    revenue. Additionally, many of these agreements require us to
    participate with other companies in multi-employer pension
    plans. To the extent those plans are underfunded, the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the
    Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, may subject
    us to substantial liabilities under those plans if we withdraw
    from them or they are terminated. Furthermore, the Pension
    Protection Act of 2006 added new funding rules generally
    applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer
    plans that are classified as “endangered,”
    “seriously endangered,” or “critical”
    status. For a plan in “critical” status, additional
    required contributions or benefit reductions may apply if a plan
    is determined to be underfunded.

Our ability to complete future acquisitions could be adversely
    affected because of our union status for a variety of reasons.
    For instance, our union agreements may be incompatible with the
    union agreements of a business we want to acquire and some
    businesses may not want to become affiliated with a union-based
    company. Additionally, we may increase our exposure to
    withdrawal liabilities for underfunded multi-employer pension
    plans to which an acquired company contributes.

Approximately 55% of our hourly employees are not unionized. The
    new presidential administration has expressed strong support for
    proposed legislation that would create more flexibility and
    opportunity for labor unions to organize non-union workers. If
    passed, this legislation could result in a greater percentage of
    our workforce being subject to collective bargaining agreements,
    heightening the risks described above. In addition, certain of
    our customers require or prefer a non-union workforce, and they
    may reduce the amount of work assigned to us if our labor crews
    were to become unionized.

We may
    incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational
    impacts relating to occupational health and safety
    matters.

Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations
    relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace.
    While we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial
    resources in our occupational health and safety programs, our
    industry involves a high degree of operational risk and there
    can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability
    exposure. Although we have taken what we believe are appropriate
    precautions, we have suffered fatalities in the past and may
    suffer additional fatalities in the future.



Serious accidents, including fatalities, may subject us to
    substantial penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution.
    Claims for damages to persons, including claims for bodily
    injury or loss of life, could result in substantial costs and
    liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our
    financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In
    addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate
    over time or we were to suffer substantial penalties or criminal
    prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations, our
    customers could cancel our contracts and not award us future
    business.

Our
    dependence on suppliers, subcontractors and equipment
    manufacturers could expose us to the risk of loss in our
    operations.

On certain projects, we rely on suppliers to obtain the
    necessary materials and subcontractors to perform portions of
    our services. We also rely on equipment manufacturers to provide
    us with the equipment required to conduct our operations.
    Although we are not dependent on any single supplier,
    subcontractor or equipment manufacturer, any substantial
    limitation on the availability of required suppliers,
    subcontractors or equipment manufacturers could negatively
    impact our operations. The risk of a lack of available
    suppliers, subcontractors or equipment manufacturers is
    heightened under the current turbulent market conditions and
    economic downturn. To the extent we cannot engage subcontractors
    or acquire equipment or materials, we could experience losses in
    the performance of our operations.

Our
    business growth could outpace the capability of our corporate
    management infrastructure.

We cannot be certain that our infrastructure will be adequate to
    support our operations as they expand. Future growth also could
    impose significant additional responsibilities on members of our
    senior management, including the need to recruit and integrate
    new senior level managers and executives. We cannot be certain
    that we will be able to recruit and retain such additional
    managers and executives. To the extent that we are unable to
    manage our growth effectively, or are unable to attract and
    retain additional qualified management, we may not be able to
    expand our operations or execute our business plan.

During
    the ordinary course of our business, we may become subject to
    lawsuits or indemnity claims, which could materially and
    adversely affect our business and results of
    operations.

We have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a
    defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings during
    the ordinary course of our business. These actions may seek,
    among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury,
    workers’ compensation, employment discrimination, breach of
    contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or
    other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition,
    we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the
    services we provide and actions we take under our contracts with
    them, and, in some instances, we may be allocated risk through
    our contract terms for actions by our customers or other third
    parties. Because our services in certain instances may be
    integral to the operation and performance of our customers’
    infrastructure, we may become subject to lawsuits or claims for
    any failure of the systems that we work on, even if our services
    are not the cause of such failures, and we could be subject to
    civil and criminal liabilities to the extent that our services
    contributed to any property damage, personal injury or system
    failure. The outcome of any of these lawsuits, claims or legal
    proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of
    management’s attention to the business. Payments of
    significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely affect
    our reputation, liquidity and results of operations.

We may
    not realize all of the anticipated synergies and other benefits
    from acquiring InfraSource.

The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on our ability
    to realize the synergies and other benefits from acquiring
    InfraSource. To realize these synergies and benefits, however,
    we must continue to successfully integrate the operations and
    personnel of InfraSource into our business. We have
    substantially completed the integration of the two companies,
    but further integration may be required to fully realize the
    benefits of the Merger. If this continuing integration is
    unsuccessful, certain anticipated benefits of the Merger may not
    be realized fully or at all, may take longer or cost more to
    realize than expected. Because we and InfraSource have
    previously operated as independent companies, it is possible the
    integration may result in the future loss



of valuable employees, the disruption of our business or
    inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices,
    policies and compensation arrangements. The size of the Merger
    may also make integration difficult, expensive and disruptive,
    adversely affecting our revenues and earnings.

A
    portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety
    bonds. We may be unable to compete for or work on certain
    projects if we are not able to obtain the necessary surety
    bonds.

Current or future market conditions, including losses incurred
    in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate
    bankruptcies, as well as changes in our sureties’
    assessment of our operating and financial risk, could cause our
    surety providers to decline to issue or renew, or substantially
    reduce the amount of, bonds for our work and could increase our
    bonding costs. These actions could be taken on short notice. If
    our surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to
    bonding, our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity
    from other sureties, finding more business that does not require
    bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project
    performance, such as letters of credit or cash. We may be unable
    to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable
    terms, or at all, which could affect our ability to bid for or
    work on future projects requiring financial assurances.

We have also granted security interests in various of our assets
    to collateralize our obligations to our sureties. Furthermore,
    under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or
    continue bonds on a

project-by-project

basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the
    posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or
    renewing any bonds. If we were to experience an interruption or
    reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of
    these or any other reasons, we may be unable to compete for or
    work on certain projects that would require bonding.

The
    departure of key personnel could disrupt our
    business.

We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and
    on senior management of our operating units, including the
    businesses we acquire. Although we have entered into employment
    agreements with terms of one to three years with most of our
    executive officers and certain other key employees, we cannot be
    certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for
    any particular period of time. The loss of key personnel, or the
    inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could
    negatively impact our ability to manage our business. We do not
    carry key-person life insurance on any of our employees.

We are
    in the process of implementing an information technology
    (“IT”) solution, which could temporarily disrupt
    day-to-day operations at certain operating units.

We have begun to design a comprehensive IT solution that we
    believe will allow for a seamless interface between functions
    such as accounting and finance, human resources, operations,
    fleet management and customer relationships. Development and
    implementation of the IT solution will require substantial
    financial and personnel resources. Implementation will occur on
    an operating unit by operating unit basis. While the IT solution
    is intended to improve and enhance our information systems,
    implementation of new information systems at each operating unit
    exposes us to the risks of

start-up

of
    the new system and integration of that system with our existing
    systems and processes, including possible disruption of our
    financial reporting. Failure to properly implement the IT
    solution could result in substantial disruptions to our
    business, including coordinating and processing our normal
    business activities, testing and recording of certain data
    necessary to provide oversight over our disclosure controls and
    procedures and effective internal controls over our financial
    reporting, and other unforeseen problems.

We may
    not be successful in continuing to meet the requirements of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has many requirements applicable
    to us regarding corporate governance and financial reporting,
    including the requirements for management to report on our
    internal controls over financial reporting and for our
    independent registered public accounting firm to express an
    opinion over the operating effectiveness of our internal control
    over financial reporting. During 2008, we continued actions to
    ensure our ability to comply with these requirements. As of
    December 31, 2008, our internal control over



financial reporting was effective; however, there can be no
    assurance that our internal control over financial reporting
    will be effective in future years. Failure to maintain effective
    internal controls or the identification of significant internal
    control deficiencies in acquisitions already made or made in the
    future could result in a decrease in the market value of our
    common stock and our other publicly traded securities, the
    reduced ability to obtain financing, the loss of customers,
    penalties and additional expenditures to meet the requirements.

Our
    failure to comply with environmental laws could result in
    significant liabilities.

Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and
    regulations, including those dealing with the handling and
    disposal of waste products, PCBs, fuel storage and air quality.
    We perform work in many different types of underground
    environments. If the field location maps supplied to us are not
    accurate, or if objects are present in the soil that are not
    indicated on the field location maps, our underground work could
    strike objects in the soil, some of which may contain
    pollutants. These objects may also rupture, resulting in the
    discharge of pollutants. In such circumstances, we may be liable
    for fines and damages, and we may be unable to obtain
    reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect
    information. In addition, we perform directional drilling
    operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and
    water bodies. Due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and
    water bodies, it is possible that such directional drilling may
    cause a surface fracture, resulting in the release of subsurface
    materials. These subsurface materials may contain contaminants
    in excess of amounts permitted by law, potentially exposing us
    to remediation costs and fines. We also own and lease several
    facilities at which we store our equipment. Some of these
    facilities contain fuel storage tanks which are above or below
    ground. If these tanks were to leak, we could be responsible for
    the cost of remediation as well as potential fines.

In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of
    existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously
    unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new

clean-up

requirements could require us to incur significant costs or
    become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could
    negatively impact our financial condition and results of
    operations. In certain instances, we have obtained
    indemnification or covenants from third parties (including
    predecessors or lessors) for such cleanup and other obligations
    and liabilities that we believe are adequate to cover such
    obligations and liabilities. However, such third-party
    indemnities or covenants may not cover all of our costs, and
    such unanticipated obligations or liabilities, or future
    obligations and liabilities, may have a material adverse effect
    on our business operations, financial condition or cash flows.
    Further, we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify
    or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities
    relating to any acquired business.

Risks
    associated with operating in international markets could
    restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business
    and prospects.

While only a small percentage of our revenue is currently
    derived from international markets, we hope to continue to
    expand the volume of services that we provide internationally.
    We presently conduct our international sales efforts in Canada,
    Mexico and select countries overseas, but expect that the number
    of countries that we operate in could expand significantly over
    the next few years. Economic conditions, including those
    resulting from wars, civil unrest, acts of terrorism and other
    conflicts or volatility in the global markets, may adversely
    affect our customers, their demand for our services and their
    ability to pay for our services. In addition, there are numerous
    risks inherent in conducting our business internationally,
    including, but not limited to, potential instability in
    international markets, changes in regulatory requirements
    applicable to international operations, currency fluctuations in
    foreign countries, political, economic and social conditions in
    foreign countries and complex U.S. and foreign laws and
    treaties, including tax laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act. These risks could restrict our ability to provide
    services to international customers and could adversely affect
    our ability to operate our business profitably.

Opportunities
    within the government arena could subject us to increased
    governmental regulation and costs.

Most government contracts are awarded through a regulated
    competitive bidding process. As we pursue increased
    opportunities in the government arena, management’s focus
    associated with the start up and bidding process may be diverted
    away from other opportunities. Involvement with government
    contracts could require



a significant amount of costs to be incurred before any revenues
    are realized from these contracts. In addition, as a government
    contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and
    other public sector liabilities, any deemed violation of which
    could lead to fines or penalties or a loss of business.
    Government agencies routinely audit and investigate government
    contractors. Government agencies may review a contractor’s
    performance under its contracts, cost structure, and compliance
    with applicable laws, regulations and standards. If government
    agencies determine through these audits or reviews that costs
    were improperly allocated to specific contracts, they will not
    reimburse the contractor for those costs or may require the
    contractor to refund previously reimbursed costs. If government
    agencies determine that we engaged in improper activity, we may
    be subject to civil and criminal penalties. In addition, if the
    government were to even allege improper activity, we also could
    experience serious harm to our reputation. Many government
    contracts must be appropriated each year. If appropriations are
    not made in subsequent years we would not realize all of the
    potential revenues from any awarded contracts.

The
    industries we serve are subject to rapid technological and
    structural changes that could reduce the demand for the services
    we provide.

The electric power, gas, telecommunications and cable television
    industries are undergoing rapid change as a result of
    technological advances that could, in certain cases, reduce the
    demand for our services, impair the value of our dark fiber
    network or otherwise negatively impact our business. New or
    developing technologies could displace the wireline systems used
    for voice, video and data transmissions, and improvements in
    existing technology may allow telecommunications and cable
    television companies to significantly improve their networks
    without physically upgrading them.

We may
    not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance
    desired growth and operations.

If we cannot secure additional financing in the future on
    acceptable terms, we may be unable to support our growth
    strategy or future operations. We cannot readily predict the
    ability of certain customers to pay for past services, and the
    recent economic downturn may negatively impact the ability of
    our customers to pay amounts owed to us. We also cannot readily
    predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts.
    Using cash for acquisitions limits our financial flexibility and
    makes us more likely to seek additional capital through future
    debt or equity financings. Our existing credit facility contains
    significant restrictions on our operational and financial
    flexibility, including our ability to incur additional debt or
    conduct equity financings, and if we seek more debt we may have
    to agree to additional covenants that limit our operational and
    financial flexibility. When we seek additional debt or equity
    financings, we cannot be certain that additional debt or equity
    will be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all, in
    particular under the current volatile market conditions.
    Furthermore, our credit facility is based upon existing
    commitments from several banks. With the current turbulent
    credit markets, banks have become more restrictive in their
    lending practices, and some may be unable or unwilling to fund
    their commitments, which may limit our access to the capital
    needed to fund our growth and operations. We also rely on
    financing companies to fund the leasing of certain of our trucks
    and trailers, support vehicles and specialty construction
    equipment. The deteriorating credit market may cause certain of
    these financing companies to restrict or withhold access to
    capital to fund the leasing of additional equipment. Although we
    are not dependent on any single equipment lessor, a widespread
    lack of available capital to fund the leasing of equipment could
    negatively impact our future operations. Additionally, the
    market price of our common stock may change significantly in
    response to various factors and events beyond our control, which
    will impact our ability to use equity to obtain funds. A variety
    of events may cause the market price of our common stock to
    fluctuate significantly, including overall market conditions or
    volatility, a shortfall in our operating results from those
    anticipated, negative results or other unfavorable information
    relating to our market peers on the risk factors described in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



Our
    convertible subordinated notes may be convertible in the future,
    which, if converted, may result in dilution to existing
    stockholders, lower prevailing market prices for our common
    stock or cause a significant cash outlay.

As a result of our common stock satisfying the market price
    condition of our convertible subordinated notes, our 3.75%
    convertible subordinated notes due 2026 (3.75% Notes) were
    convertible at the option of the holders during various quarters
    in 2007 and 2008. The 3.75% Notes are not presently
    convertible, but may resume convertibility in future periods
    upon satisfaction of the market price condition or other
    conditions.

We have the right to deliver shares of our common stock, cash or
    a combination of cash and shares of our common stock upon a
    conversion of the notes. The number of shares issuable upon
    conversion will be determined based on a conversion rate of
    approximately $22.41 for the 3.75% Notes. In the event that
    all 3.75% Notes were converted for common stock, we would
    issue an aggregate of 6.4 million shares of our common
    stock. The conversion of some or all of our 3.75% Notes
    into our common stock would dilute existing stockholders. Any
    sales in the public market of the common stock issued upon such
    conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of
    our common stock. In addition, the possibility that the notes
    may be converted may encourage short-selling by market
    participants because the conversion of the notes could depress
    the price of our common stock.

If we elect to satisfy the conversion obligation in cash, the
    amount of cash payable upon conversion of the notes will be
    determined by the product of (i) the number of shares
    issuable for the principal amount of the converted notes at a
    conversion rate of approximately $22.41 per share for the
    3.75% Notes and (ii) the average closing price of our
    common stock during a

20-day

trading period following the holders unretracted election to
    convert the notes. To the extent we decide to pay cash to settle
    any conversions and the average closing price of our common
    stock during this period exceeds $22.41 for the
    3.75% Notes, we would have to pay cash in excess of the
    principal amount of the notes being converted, which would
    result in the recording of a loss on extinguishment of debt.

Certain
    provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an
    acquisition of our company more difficult.

The following provisions of our certificate of incorporation and
    bylaws, as currently in effect, as well as our stockholder
    rights plan and Delaware law, could discourage potential
    proposals to acquire us, delay or prevent a change in control of
    us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in
    the future for shares of our common stock:

•

our certificate of incorporation permits our Board of Directors
    to issue “blank check” preferred stock and to adopt
    amendments to our bylaws;

•

our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of
    stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be
    considered at stockholder meetings;

•

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right
    of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to
    act by written consent;

•

we are subject to provisions of Delaware law which prohibit us
    from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions
    with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three
    years following the date such stockholder became classified as
    an interested stockholder; and

•

we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that could cause
    substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
    acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors or
    permitted by the stockholder rights plan.

Properties

Facilities

We lease our corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas and
    maintain facilities nationwide. Our facilities are used for
    offices, equipment yards, warehouses, storage and vehicle shops.
    As of December 31, 2008, we own 31 of the facilities we
    occupy, many of which are encumbered by our credit facility, and
    we lease the remainder. We believe that our existing facilities
    are sufficient for our current needs.

Equipment

We operate a nationwide fleet of owned and leased trucks and
    trailers, support vehicles and specialty construction equipment,
    such as backhoes, excavators, trenchers, generators, boring
    machines, cranes, wire pullers and tensioners, all of which are
    encumbered by our credit facility. As of December 31, 2008,
    the total size of the rolling-stock fleet was approximately
    24,000 units. Most of this fleet is serviced by our own
    mechanics who work at various maintenance sites and facilities.
    We believe that these vehicles generally are well maintained and
    adequate for our present operations.

ITEM 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are from time to time a party to various lawsuits, claims and
    other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These actions typically seek, among other things,
    compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract

and/or

property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
    losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all
    such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record reserves when
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not believe that any
    of these proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, would be
    expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In October and November 2008, we issued an aggregate
    90,394 shares of our common stock in exchange for Limited
    Vote Common Stock. In addition, on November 21, 2008, we
    completed the acquisition of two affiliated telecommunications
    engineering companies in which some of the consideration
    consisted of our unregistered securities of Quanta. The
    aggregate consideration paid in this transaction was
    $6.2 million in cash and 281,896 shares of common
    stock. This acquisition was not affiliated with any other
    acquisition prior to such transaction.

All securities listed on the following table are shares of our
    common stock. We relied on Section 4(2) of the Securities
    Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), as the basis for
    exemption from registration. For all issuances, the purchasers
    were “accredited investors” as defined in
    Rule 501 of the Securities Act. All issuances were as a
    result of privately negotiated transactions, and not pursuant to
    public solicitations.

Dividends

We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to
    finance the growth, development and expansion of our business.
    Accordingly, we currently do not intend to declare or pay any
    cash dividends on our common stock in the immediate future. The
    declaration, payment and amount of future cash dividends, if
    any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after
    taking into account various factors. These factors include our
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flows from
    operations, current and anticipated capital requirements and
    expansion plans, the income tax laws then in effect and the
    requirements of Delaware law. In addition, as discussed in

“Debt Instruments — Credit Facility”

in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”
    our credit facility includes limitations on the payment of cash
    dividends without the consent of the lenders.

Performance
    Graph

The following Performance Graph and related information shall
    not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be
    “filed” with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
    nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any
    future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that
    we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.

The following graph compares, for the period from
    December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2008, the cumulative
    stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total
    return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (the
    S&P 500 Index), the Russell 2000 Index, a peer group index
    previously selected by our management that includes five public
    companies within our industry (the Previous Peer Group) and a
    new peer group index selected by our management that includes
    six public companies within our industry (the New Peer Group).
    The comparison assumes that $100 was invested on
    December 31, 2003 in our common stock, the S&P 500
    Index, the Russell 2000 Index, the Previous Peer Group and the
    New Peer Group, and further assumes all dividends were
    reinvested. The stock price performance reflected on the
    following graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock
    price performance.

Due to our desire to regularly modify our peer group index, as
    appropriate, to ensure that it is comprised of companies whose
    operations are similar to ours, our management added MYR Group
    Inc., which completed its initial public offering on
    August 12, 2008, to our peer group index. Accordingly, the
    New Peer Group graph assumes $100 was invested in MYR Group Inc.
    on August 12, 2008, and therefore the stock price
    performance for the New Peer Group and Previous Peer Group from
    December 31, 2003 to August 11, 2008 is identical. The
    Previous Peer Group is composed of Dycom Industries, Inc.,
    MasTec, Inc., Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., Shaw
    Group, Inc. and Pike Electric Corporation. The New Peer Group is
    composed of Dycom Industries, Inc., MasTec, Inc., Chicago
    Bridge & Iron Company N.V., Shaw Group, Inc., Pike
    Electric Corporation and MYR Group Inc. The companies in the New
    Peer Group were selected because they comprise a broad group of
    publicly held corporations, each of which has some operations
    similar to ours. When taken



as a whole, the New Peer Group more closely resembles our total
    business than any individual company in the group or than the
    Previous Peer Group.

Selected
    Financial Data

The following historical selected financial data has been
    derived from the audited financial statements of Quanta. The
    historical financial statement data reflects the acquisitions of
    businesses accounted for as of their respective acquisition
    dates, the most significant of which was InfraSource, and the
    results of InfraSource’s operations have been included in
    the consolidated financial statements subsequent to
    August 31, 2007. Additionally, on August 31, 2007, we
    sold the operating assets associated with the business of
    Environmental Professional Associates, Limited (EPA), a Quanta
    subsidiary. The statements of operations data below do not
    reflect the operations of EPA in any periods since EPA’s
    results of operations are reflected as a discontinued operation
    in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
    Accordingly, the 2004 through 2006 amounts below do not agree to
    the amounts originally reported. The historical selected
    financial data should be read in conjunction with the historical
    Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto
    included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations should be read in
    conjunction with our historical consolidated financial
    statements and related notes thereto in Item 8
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The
    discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are
    based upon our current expectations and are subject to
    uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may
    differ materially from these expectations due to inaccurate
    assumptions and known or unknown risks and uncertainties,
    including those identified in “Uncertainty of
    Forward-Looking Statements and Information” below and in
    Item 1A “Risk Factors.”

Introduction

We are a leading national provider of specialty contracting
    services. On January 1, 2008, we began reporting our
    results under two business segments. The infrastructure services
    (Infrastructure Services) segment provides specialized
    contracting services, offering end-to-end network solutions to
    the electric power, gas, telecommunications and cable television
    industries. Specifically, the comprehensive services provided by
    the Infrastructure Services segment include designing,
    installing, repairing and maintaining network infrastructure, as
    well as certain ancillary services. Additionally, the dark fiber
    (Dark Fiber) segment designs, procures, constructs and maintains
    fiber-optic telecommunications infrastructure in select markets
    and licenses the right to use point-to-point fiber-optic
    telecommunications facilities to our customers. The Dark Fiber
    segment services educational institutions, large industrial and
    financial services customers and other entities with high
    bandwidth telecommunication needs. The telecommunication
    services provided through this business are subject to
    regulation by the Federal Communications Commission and certain
    state public utility commissions.

On August 30, 2007, we acquired, through a merger
    transaction (the Merger), all of the outstanding common stock of
    InfraSource Services, Inc. (InfraSource). Similar to us,
    InfraSource provided design, procurement, construction, testing
    and maintenance services to electric power utilities, natural
    gas utilities, telecommunication customers, government entities
    and heavy industrial companies, such as petrochemical,
    processing and refining businesses, primarily in the United
    States. As a result of the Merger, we enhanced and expanded our
    position as a leading specialized contracting services company
    serving the electric power, gas, telecommunications and cable
    television industries and added the Dark Fiber segment.

We had consolidated revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 of approximately $3.78 billion, of
    which 56.8% was attributable to electric power work, 20.8% to
    gas work, 14.2% to telecommunications and cable television work
    and 6.6% to ancillary services, such as inside electrical
    wiring, intelligent traffic networks, fueling systems, cable and
    control systems for light rail lines, airports and highways and
    specialty rock trenching, directional boring and road milling
    for industrial and commercial customers. In addition, 1.6% of
    our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31,
    2008 was generated by our Dark Fiber segment.

Our customers include many of the leading companies in the
    industries we serve. We have developed strong strategic
    alliances with numerous customers and strive to develop and
    maintain our status as a preferred vendor to our customers. In
    our Infrastructure Services segment, we enter into various types
    of contracts,



including competitive unit price, hourly rate, cost-plus (or
    time and materials basis), and fixed price (or lump sum basis),
    the final terms and prices of which we frequently negotiate with
    the customer. Although the terms of our contracts vary
    considerably, most are made on either a unit price or fixed
    price basis in which we agree to do the work for a price per
    unit of work performed (unit price) or for a fixed amount for
    the entire project (fixed price). We complete a substantial
    majority of our fixed price projects within one year, while we
    frequently provide maintenance and repair work under open-ended
    unit price or cost-plus master service agreements that are
    renewable annually.

For our Infrastructure Services segment, we recognize revenue on
    our unit price and cost-plus contracts when units are completed
    or services are performed. For our fixed price contracts, we
    record revenues as work on the contract progresses on a
    percentage-of-completion basis. Under this method, revenue is
    recognized based on the percentage of total costs incurred to
    date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the
    contract. Fixed price contracts generally include retainage
    provisions under which a percentage of the contract price is
    withheld until the project is complete and has been accepted by
    our customer.

The Dark Fiber segment constructs and licenses the right to use
    fiber-optic telecommunications facilities to our customers
    pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with terms from five
    to twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal options.
    Under those agreements, customers are provided the right to use
    a portion of the capacity of a fiber-optic facility, with the
    facility owned and maintained by us. Revenues earned pursuant to
    these fiber-optic facility licensing agreements, including any
    initial fees or advanced billings, are recognized ratably over
    the expected length of the agreements, including probable
    renewal periods.

We recognize that we and our customers are operating in a
    challenging business environment in light of the economic
    downturn and volatile capital markets. We are closely monitoring
    our customers and the effect that changes in economic and market
    conditions may have on them. We believe that our customers, many
    of whom are regulated utilities, remain financially stable in
    general, and many of our customers may be able to continue with
    their business plans without substantial constraints. While our
    business was not significantly impacted by the negative economic
    and market conditions in 2008, we expect these conditions may
    negatively impact demand for our services in the near-term until
    these conditions significantly improve.

Seasonality;
    Fluctuations of Results

Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to
    seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced
    by weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, project
    schedules and timing and holidays. Typically, our revenues are
    lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or
    wet conditions cause delays. The second quarter is typically
    better than the first, as some projects begin, but continued
    cold and wet weather can often impact second quarter
    productivity. The third quarter is typically the best of the
    year, as a greater number of projects are underway and weather
    is more accommodating to work on projects. Revenues during the
    fourth quarter of the year are typically lower than the third
    quarter but higher than the second quarter. Many projects are
    completed in the fourth quarter, and revenues are often impacted
    positively by customers seeking to spend their capital budget
    before the end of the year; however, the holiday season and
    inclement weather sometimes can cause delays and thereby reduce
    revenues and increase costs.

Additionally, our industry can be highly cyclical. As a result,
    our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines or
    delays in new projects in various geographic regions in the
    United States. Project schedules, in particular in connection
    with larger, longer-term projects, can also create fluctuations
    in the services provided under projects, which may adversely
    affect us in a given quarter. The financial condition of our
    customers and their access to capital, variations in the margins
    of projects performed during any particular quarter, regional,
    national and global economic and market conditions, timing of
    acquisitions, the timing and magnitude of acquisition
    assimilation costs and interest rate fluctuations may also
    materially affect quarterly results. Accordingly, our operating
    results in any particular quarter or year may not be indicative
    of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or for
    any other year. You should read

“Outlook”

and

“Understanding Gross Margins”

for additional
    discussion of trends and challenges that may affect our
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.



Understanding
    Gross Margins

Our gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of
    revenues. Cost of services, which is subtracted from revenues to
    obtain gross profit, consists primarily of salaries, wages and
    benefits to employees, depreciation, fuel and other equipment
    expenses, equipment rentals, subcontracted services, insurance,
    facilities expenses, materials and parts and supplies. Various
    factors — some controllable, some not —
    impact our gross margins on a quarterly or annual basis.

Seasonal and Geographical.

As discussed above,
    seasonal patterns can have a significant impact on gross
    margins. Generally, business is slower in the winter months
    versus the warmer months of the year. This can be offset
    somewhat by increased demand for electrical service and repair
    work resulting from severe weather. In addition, the mix of
    business conducted in different parts of the country will affect
    margins, as some parts of the country offer the opportunity for
    higher gross margins than others.

Weather.

Adverse or favorable weather
    conditions can impact gross margins in a given period. For
    example, it is typical in the first quarter of any fiscal year
    that parts of the country may experience snow or rainfall that
    may negatively impact our revenues and gross margin due to
    reduced productivity. In many cases, projects may be delayed or
    temporarily placed on hold. Conversely, in periods when weather
    remains dry and temperatures are accommodating, more work can be
    done, sometimes with less cost, which would have a favorable
    impact on gross margins. In some cases, severe weather, such as
    hurricanes and ice storms, can provide us with higher margin
    emergency restoration service work, which generally has a
    positive impact on margins.

Revenue Mix.

The mix of revenues derived from
    the industries we serve will impact gross margins, as certain
    industries provide higher margin opportunities. Additionally,
    changes in our customers’ spending patterns in each of the
    industries we serve can cause an imbalance in supply and demand
    and, therefore, affect margins and mix of revenues by industry
    served.

Service and Maintenance versus
    Installation.

Installation work is often obtained
    on a fixed price basis, while maintenance work is often
    performed under pre-established or negotiated prices or
    cost-plus pricing arrangements. Gross margins for installation
    work may vary from project to project, and can be higher than
    maintenance work, because work obtained on a fixed price basis
    has higher risk than other types of pricing arrangements. We
    typically derive approximately 50% of our annual revenues from
    maintenance work, but a higher portion of installation work in
    any given period may affect our gross margins for that period.

Subcontract Work.

Work that is subcontracted
    to other service providers generally yields lower gross margins.
    An increase in subcontract work in a given period may contribute
    to a decrease in gross margin. We typically subcontract
    approximately 10% to 15% of our work to other service providers.

Materials versus Labor.

Margins may be lower
    on projects on which we furnish materials as our

mark-up

on
    materials is generally lower than on labor costs. In a given
    period, a higher percentage of work that has a higher materials
    component may decrease overall gross margin.

Depreciation.

We include depreciation in cost
    of services. This is common practice in our industry, but it can
    make comparability to other companies difficult. This must be
    taken into consideration when comparing us to other companies.

Insurance.

Gross margins could be impacted by
    fluctuations in insurance accruals as additional claims arise
    and as circumstances and conditions of existing claims change.
    We are insured for employer’s liability claims, subject to
    a deductible of $1.0 million per occurrence, and for
    general liability and auto liability subject to a deductible of
    $3.0 million per occurrence. We are also insured for
    workers’ compensation claims, subject to a deductible of
    $2.0 million per occurrence. Additionally, we are subject
    to an annual cumulative aggregate liability of up to
    $1.0 million on workers’ compensation claims in excess
    of $2.0 million per occurrence. We also have employee
    health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is
    subject to a deductible of $350,000 per claimant per year.



Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily
    of compensation and related benefits to management,
    administrative salaries and benefits, marketing, office rent and
    utilities, communications, professional fees, bad debt expense,
    letter of credit fees and gains and losses on the sale of
    property and equipment.

Revenues.

Revenues increased
    $1.12 billion, or 42.3%, to $3.78 billion for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. Electric power services increased
    by approximately $637.1 million, or 42.2%, gas services
    increased by approximately $427.4 million, or 119.7%, and
    telecommunications and cable television network services
    increased by approximately $92.1 million, or 20.8%. In
    addition to the contribution of revenues from the InfraSource
    operating units acquired through the Merger, revenues were
    favorably impacted by an increase of approximately
    $76.8 million in emergency restoration services, from
    approximately $130.9 million in 2007 to approximately
    $207.7 million in 2008, due primarily to the impact of
    hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region of the United States.
    Additionally, revenues increased due to an increased number and
    size of projects as a result of larger capital budgets for our
    customers, specifically in connection with electric transmission
    projects and certain natural gas transmission projects, as well
    as improved pricing. Lastly, revenues increased due to the
    impact of $44.9 million in additional revenues in 2008 from
    the Dark Fiber segment acquired as part of the Merger. Partially
    offsetting these increases was a decrease in ancillary services
    revenues of approximately



$77.4 million, or 23.6%, primarily due to declines in the
    housing market, the timing of projects and more selectivity in
    projects bid, as well as resources being utilized for projects
    in other types of work.

Gross profit.

Gross profit increased
    $206.1 million, or 48.1%, to $634.9 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in gross profit
    results primarily from the contribution of the InfraSource
    operating units acquired through the Merger coupled with the
    effect of the increased revenues discussed above. As a
    percentage of revenues, gross margin increased from 16.1% in
    2007 to 16.8% in 2008. The gross margin was positively impacted
    in 2008 as compared to 2007 by improved pricing, an increase in
    the amount of emergency restoration services, as discussed
    above, which typically generate higher margins, the contribution
    of the higher margin Dark Fiber segment acquired as part of the
    Merger and better fixed costs absorption as a result of higher
    revenues. These positive factors were partially offset by
    declines in margins derived from telecommunications and
    ancillary revenues due to losses on a telecommunication project
    and certain intelligent traffic network projects during the
    third and fourth quarters of 2008.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased $68.9 million, or 28.6%, to
    $309.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was
    primarily a result of the addition of administrative expenses
    associated with the InfraSource operating units acquired through
    the Merger, as well as higher salaries and benefits associated
    with increased personnel, salary increases and increased
    performance bonuses. Bad debt expense increased
    $6.0 million in 2008 to $7.3 million primarily due to
    the economic downturn and volatile capital markets experienced
    during the second half of 2008. As a percentage of revenues,
    selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 9.0%
    in 2007 to 8.2% in 2008 primarily due to improved cost
    absorption as a result of higher revenues.

Amortization of intangible
    assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    increased $17.5 million to $36.3 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. This increase is attributable to
    the amortization of intangible assets associated with
    acquisitions completed since the beginning of 2007, primarily
    the acquisition of InfraSource completed on August 30, 2007.

Interest expense.

Interest expense decreased
    $4.0 million to $17.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, due to the conversion, redemption or
    repurchase of all of the remaining 4.5% convertible subordinated
    notes on or before October 8, 2008 and the maturity and
    repayment of the remaining 4.0% convertible subordinated notes
    on July 2, 2007.

Interest income.

Interest income was
    $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to $20.0 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The decrease in interest income
    primarily relates to a lower average investment balance and
    lower average interest rates for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

Provision for income taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes was $115.0 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, with an effective tax rate of 40.8%,
    compared to a provision of $34.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, with an effective tax rate of 20.4%. The
    lower effective tax rate for 2007 resulted from
    $34.4 million of tax benefits recorded in 2007 primarily
    due to a decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions
    resulting from the settlement of a multi-year Internal Revenue
    Service audit in the first quarter of 2007 and the expiration of
    various federal and state tax statutes of limitations during the
    third quarter of 2007. Excluding the tax benefits, the effective
    tax rate would have been 41.0% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

    compared to 2006

Revenues.

Revenues increased
    $546.4 million, or 25.9%, to $2.66 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2007. Of the $546.4 million
    increase, approximately $348.4 million relates to revenues
    of the InfraSource operating units acquired through the Merger
    for the period from September 1, 2007 through
    December 31, 2007. The remaining $198.0 million
    increase is due primarily to electric power services increasing
    by approximately $157.3 million, or 13.7%, and
    telecommunications and cable television network services
    increasing by approximately $46.9 million, or 12.9%, offset
    by a slight decrease in gas and ancillary



services. The increase in electric power services work is
    primarily due to the increased number and size of projects that
    are a result of larger capital budgets for our customers,
    approximately $24.9 million in additional emergency
    restoration service work, and improved pricing. Revenues from
    telecommunications and cable television services increased
    primarily due to increased services related to fiber to the
    premises initiatives and improved pricing.

Gross profit.

Gross profit increased
    $116.0 million, or 37.1%, to $428.7 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2007. Of the $116.0 million
    increase, approximately $61.0 million relates to gross
    profit of the InfraSource operating units acquired in the Merger
    for the period September 1, 2007 through December 31,
    2007. The additional $54.9 million increase in gross profit
    resulted primarily from increased margins associated with
    generally improved pricing for our services, higher productivity
    and good weather that favorably impacted projects in the
    Northeast during the summer months, higher volumes of emergency
    restoration service work and better absorption of fixed costs.
    These positive effects were partially offset by lower
    productivity on certain projects due to heavy rainfall in the
    south central United States during the second quarter of 2007
    and early part of the third quarter of 2007.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased $59.0 million, or 32.5%, to
    $240.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.
    As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased from 8.6% in 2006 to 9.0% in 2007. Of the
    $59.0 million increase, $28.9 million relates to
    selling, general and administrative expenses of the InfraSource
    operating units acquired in the Merger for the period of
    September 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007. The
    remaining $30.1 million increase in selling, general and
    administrative expenses resulted in part from $11.2 million
    in increased salaries and benefits costs associated with
    additional personnel, salary increases and higher performance
    bonuses, $5.2 million in increased professional fees
    primarily associated with ongoing litigation costs and
    $2.4 million in third-party integration costs that were
    incurred in 2007 as part of the InfraSource acquisition. Also
    included were $5.3 million in net losses on sales of
    equipment during 2007, as compared to $0.7 million in net
    gains on sales of equipment in 2006. Included in the
    $5.3 million in net losses in 2007 was an impairment charge
    of $3.5 million for assets held for sale as of
    December 31, 2007. As part of the Merger, management
    identified excess equipment among the combined operations and
    determined that this equipment would not be placed back into
    service. Additionally, we had increases in travel costs of
    $1.8 million and facilities costs of $1.7 million.

Amortization of intangible
    assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    increased $18.4 million to $18.8 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007. This increase is attributable to
    the amortization of intangible assets associated with
    acquisitions completed in 2007, primarily the acquisition of
    InfraSource.

Goodwill impairment.

A goodwill impairment
    charge in the amount of $56.8 million was recorded during
    the year ended December 31, 2006, while no goodwill
    impairment was recorded during the year ended December 31,
    2007. As part of our 2006 annual test for goodwill impairment,
    goodwill in the amount of $56.8 million was written off as
    a non-cash operating expense associated with a decrease in the
    expected future demand for the services of one of our
    businesses, which historically served the cable television
    industry.

Interest expense.

Interest expense decreased
    $5.3 million to $21.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, due partially to the expensing of
    unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.3 million during 2006
    as a result of replacing our prior credit facility in June 2006
    and repurchasing 80.7% of our 4.0% convertible subordinated
    notes in the second quarter of 2006. The 3.75% convertible
    subordinated notes issued in the second quarter of 2006 have a
    lower interest rate than the 4.0% convertible subordinated
    notes. Additionally, interest expense decreased as a result of
    the maturity and repayment of the remaining 4.0% convertible
    subordinated notes on July 2, 2007.

Interest income.

Interest income was
    $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to $13.9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The increase in interest income
    primarily relates to a higher average investment balance and
    higher average interest rates for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2006.



Provision for income taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes was $34.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, with an effective tax rate of 20.4%,
    compared to a provision of $47.0 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, with an effective tax rate of 74.3%. The
    lower effective tax rate for 2007 results from
    $34.4 million of tax benefits recorded in 2007 primarily
    due to a decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions
    resulting from the settlement of a multi-year Internal Revenue
    Service audit in the first quarter of 2007 and the expiration of
    various federal and state tax statutes of limitations during the
    third quarter of 2007. Excluding the tax benefits, the effective
    tax rate would have been 41.0% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The higher tax rate in 2006 results
    primarily from the goodwill impairment charge recorded during
    the fourth quarter of 2006, the majority of which is not
    deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the effect of the
    goodwill impairment charge, the effective tax rate would have
    been 39.2% for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Cash
    Requirements

We anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, which
    totaled $437.9 million as of December 31, 2008,
    existing borrowing capacity under our credit facility, and our
    future cash flows from operations will provide sufficient funds
    to enable us to meet our future operating needs, debt service
    requirements and planned capital expenditures, as well as
    facilitate our ability to grow in the foreseeable future.
    Management assesses our liquidity in terms of our ability to
    generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing
    activities. Increased demand for services resulting from, for
    example, initiatives to rebuild the United States electric power
    grid or support renewable energy projects may require a
    significant amount of additional working capital. We also
    evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions from time to
    time that may require cash.

Although recent distress in the financial markets has not had a
    significant impact on our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, management continues to monitor the
    financial markets and general national and global economic
    conditions. If further changes in financial markets or other
    areas of the economy adversely impacted our ability to access
    capital markets, we would expect to rely on a combination of
    available cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facility
    to provide short-term funding. We consider our cash investment
    policies to be conservative in that we maintain a diverse
    portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality cash investments
    with short-term maturities. We were in compliance with our
    covenants under our credit facility at December 31, 2008.
    Accordingly, we do not anticipate that the current volatility in
    the capital markets will have a material impact on the principal
    amounts of our cash investments or our ability to rely upon our
    existing credit facility for funds. To date, we have experienced
    no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash
    equivalents; however, we can provide no assurances that access
    to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted
    by adverse conditions in the financial markets.

Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately
    $180 million for 2009. Approximately $85 million of
    the expected 2009 capital expenditures are targeted for the
    expansion of our dark fiber network, primarily in connection
    with committed customer arrangements, with the majority of the
    remaining expenditures for operating equipment in the
    Infrastructure Services segment.

Our 3.75% convertible subordinated notes due 2026
    (3.75% Notes) are not presently convertible into our common
    stock, although they have been convertible in certain prior
    quarters as a result of the satisfaction of the market price
    condition described in further detail in

“Debt
    Instruments — 3.75% Convertible Subordinated
    Notes”

below. The 3.75% Notes could become
    convertible in future periods upon the satisfaction of the
    market price condition or other conditions. If any holder of the
    convertible notes requests to convert their notes, we have the
    option to deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a
    combination thereof, with the amount of cash determined in
    accordance with the terms of the indenture under which the notes
    were issued.



Sources
    and Uses of Cash

As of December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents
    of $437.9 million, working capital of $929.7 million
    and long-term debt of $143.8 million, net of current
    maturities. We also had $160.2 million of letters of credit
    outstanding under our credit facility, leaving
    $314.8 million available for revolving loans or issuing new
    letters of credit.

Operating
    Activities

Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for
    our services, operating margins and the type of services we
    provide but can also be influenced by working capital needs such
    as the timing of collection of receivables. Working capital
    needs are generally higher during the summer and fall months due
    to increased services in weather affected regions of the
    country. Conversely, working capital assets are typically
    converted to cash during the winter months. Operating activities
    provided net cash to us of $242.5 million during 2008 as
    compared to $219.2 million and $120.6 million during
    2007 and 2006. The increase in operating cash flows in 2008 as
    compared to 2007 relates primarily to higher levels of income
    due to year over year growth and contributions from higher
    profit margins, and was largely offset by increased accounts
    receivable at December 31, 2008, which resulted in part
    from the timing of collections that occurred shortly after
    year-end. Accounts receivable also included larger retainage
    balances on certain projects that were billed and collected in
    2009.

The increase in operating cash flows in 2007 as compared to 2006
    relates primarily to the growth in net income and revenues as a
    result of the Merger and internal growth as described above.

Investing
    Activities

During 2008, we used net cash in investing activities of
    $219.3 million as compared to $120.6 million and
    $38.5 million used in investing activities in 2007 and
    2006. Investing activities in 2008 included $185.6 million
    used for capital expenditures, partially offset by
    $15.4 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment.
    During 2007 and 2006, we used $127.9 and $48.5 million for
    capital expenditures, partially offset by $27.5 million and
    $10.0 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. The
    increase in capital expenditures of $57.7 million in 2008
    compared to 2007 and $79.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006
    are related primarily to the growth in our business and capital
    expenditure requirements as a result of the Merger, primarily
    from our Dark Fiber segment, which expended $99.6 million
    and $23.7 million during 2008 and 2007. Investing
    activities during 2008 also include $34.5 million in net
    cash outlays for three acquisitions and $14.6 million paid
    to secure patents and developed technology. Quanta made four
    acquisitions during 2007, including the Merger. Investing cash
    flows in 2007 include $20.1 million in net cash outlay for
    these acquisitions, including $12.1 million of acquisition
    expenses related to the Merger. Investing activities in 2006 and
    the first quarter of 2007 included purchases and sales of
    variable rate demand notes (VRDNs), which are classified as
    short-term investments, available for sale when held. We did not
    invest in VRDNs after the first quarter of 2007.

Financing
    Activities

In 2008, financing activities provided net cash of
    $8.2 million as compared to $78.9 million and
    $2.7 million used in financing activities in 2007 and 2006.
    Net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 resulted
    primarily from $6.0 million received from the exercise of
    stock options. Net cash used in financing activities in 2007
    resulted primarily from a $60.5 million repayment of debt
    associated with the Merger and a $33.3 million repayment of
    the 4.0% convertible subordinated notes. The $2.7 million
    net use of cash in 2006 resulted primarily from a repayment of
    $7.5 million under the term loan portion of our prior
    credit facility coupled with $6.0 million in debt issuance
    costs, partially offset by $5.8 million in net borrowings
    and certain activity related to stock compensation. The
    $5.8 million in net borrowings primarily relates to the
    issuance of $143.8 million aggregate principal amount of
    our 3.75% convertible subordinated notes and the repurchase
    through a tender offer of $137.1 million aggregate
    principal amount of our 4.0% convertible subordinated notes.



Debt
    Instruments

Credit
    Facility

We have a credit facility with various lenders that provides for
    a $475.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility
    maturing on September 19, 2012. Borrowings under the credit
    facility are to be used for working capital, capital
    expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The entire
    unused portion of the credit facility is available for the
    issuance of letters of credit.

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately
    $160.2 million of letters of credit issued under the credit
    facility and no outstanding revolving loans. The remaining
    $314.8 million was available for revolving loans or issuing
    new letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the credit
    facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either
    (a) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the credit facility)
    plus 0.875% to 1.75%, as determined by the ratio of our total
    funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit
    facility), or (b) the base rate (as described below) plus
    0.00% to 0.75%, as determined by the ratio of our total funded
    debt to consolidated EBITDA. Letters of credit issued under the
    credit facility are subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.875%
    to 1.75%, based on the ratio of Quanta’s total funded debt
    to consolidated EBITDA. We are also subject to a commitment fee
    of 0.15% to 0.35%, based on the ratio of its total funded debt
    to consolidated EBITDA, on any unused availability under the
    credit facility. The base rate equals the higher of (i) the
    Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus


/


of 1% or (ii) the bank’s prime rate.

The credit facility contains certain covenants, including
    covenants with respect to maximum funded debt to consolidated
    EBITDA, maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA and minimum
    interest coverage, in each case as specified in the credit
    facility. For purposes of calculating the maximum funded debt to
    consolidated EBITDA ratio and the maximum senior debt to
    consolidated EBITDA ratio, our maximum funded debt and maximum
    senior debt are reduced by all cash and cash equivalents (as
    defined in the credit facility) held by us in excess of
    $25.0 million. As of December 31, 2008, we were in
    compliance with all of its covenants. The credit facility limits
    certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, capital
    expenditures, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and,
    subject to certain exceptions, prohibits liens on material
    assets. The credit facility also limits the payment of dividends
    and stock repurchase programs in any fiscal year except those
    payments or other distributions payable solely in capital stock.
    The credit facility provides for customary events of default and
    carries cross-default provisions with all of our existing
    subordinated notes, our continuing indemnity and security
    agreement with our sureties and all of our other debt
    instruments exceeding $15.0 million in borrowings. If an
    event of default (as defined in the credit facility) occurs and
    is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
    forth in the credit facility, amounts outstanding under the
    credit facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared
    immediately due and payable.

The credit facility is secured by a pledge of all of the capital
    stock of our U.S. subsidiaries, 65% of the capital stock of
    our foreign subsidiaries and substantially all of our assets.
    Our U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the repayment of all
    amounts due under the credit facility. Our obligations under the
    credit facility constitute designated senior indebtedness under
    our 3.75% Notes.

4.0% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

During the first half of 2007, we had outstanding
    $33.3 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0%
    convertible subordinated notes due 2007 (4.0% Notes), which
    matured on July 1, 2007. The outstanding principal balance
    of the 4.0% Notes plus accrued interest was repaid on
    July 2, 2007, the first business day after the maturity
    date.

4.5% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

At December 31, 2008, none of our 4.5% convertible
    subordinated notes due 2023 (4.5% Notes) were outstanding.
    The 4.5% Notes were originally issued in October 2003
    for an aggregate principal amount of $270.0 million and
    required semi-annual interest payments on April 1 and October 1
    until maturity. The resale of the 4.5% Notes and the shares
    issuable upon their conversion was registered for the benefit of
    the holders on a shelf registration statement filed with
    the SEC.



The indenture under which the 4.5% Notes was issued
    provided the holders of the notes the right to require us to
    repurchase in cash, on October 1, 2008, all or some of
    their notes at the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
    unpaid interest. As a result of this repurchase right, we
    reclassified approximately $270.0 million outstanding
    aggregate principal amount of the 4.5% Notes as a current
    obligation in October 2007.

The indenture also provided that, beginning October 8,
    2008, we had the right to redeem for cash some or all of the
    4.5% Notes at the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
    unpaid interest. On August 27, 2008, we notified the
    registered holders of the 4.5% Notes that we would redeem
    the notes on October 8, 2008. Upon notification of the
    redemption and until October 6, 2008, the holders of the
    4.5% Notes had the right to convert all or a portion of the
    principal amount of their notes to shares of our common stock at
    a conversion rate of 89.7989 shares of common stock for
    each $1,000 principal amount of notes converted, which equates
    to a conversion price of $11.14 per share.

During 2008, the holders of $269.8 million aggregate
    principal amount of the 4.5% Notes elected to convert their
    notes, resulting in the issuance of 24,229,781 shares of
    our common stock, substantially all of which followed the
    redemption notice. We also repurchased $106,000 aggregate
    principal amount of the 4.5% Notes on October 1, 2008
    pursuant to the holders’ election and redeemed for cash
    $49,000 aggregate principal amount of the notes, plus accrued
    and unpaid interest, on October 8, 2008. As a result of all
    of these transactions, none of the 4.5% Notes remained
    outstanding as of October 8, 2008.

3.75% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding
    $143.8 million aggregate principal amount of
    3.75% Notes. The resale of the notes and the shares
    issuable upon conversion thereof was registered for the benefit
    of the holders on a shelf registration statement filed with the
    SEC. The 3.75% Notes mature on April 30, 2026 and bear
    interest at the annual rate of 3.75%, payable semi-annually on
    April 30 and October 30, until maturity.

The 3.75% Notes are convertible into our common stock,
    based on an initial conversion rate of 44.6229 shares of
    our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 3.75% Notes
    (which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately
    $22.41 per share), subject to adjustment as a result of certain
    events. The 3.75% Notes are convertible by the holder
    (i) during any fiscal quarter if the closing price of our
    common stock is greater than 130% of the conversion price for at
    least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading
    days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
    fiscal quarter, (ii) upon us calling the 3.75% Notes
    for redemption, (iii) upon the occurrence of specified
    distributions to holders of our common stock or specified
    corporate transactions or (iv) at any time on or after
    March 1, 2026 until the business day immediately preceding
    the maturity date of the 3.75% Notes. The 3.75% Notes
    are not presently convertible, although they have been
    convertible in certain prior quarters as a result of the
    satisfaction of the market price condition in clause (i)
    above. If the 3.75% Notes become convertible under any of
    these circumstances, we have the option to deliver cash, shares
    of our common stock or a combination thereof, with the amount of
    cash determined in accordance with the terms of the indenture
    under which the notes were issued. Conversions that may occur in
    the future could result in the recording of losses on
    extinguishment of debt if the conversions are settled in cash
    for an amount in excess of the principal amount. The holders of
    the 3.75% Notes who convert their notes in connection with
    certain change in control transactions, as defined in the
    indenture, may be entitled to a make whole premium in the form
    of an increase in the conversion rate. In the event of a change
    in control, in lieu of paying holders a make whole premium, if
    applicable, we may elect, in some circumstances, to adjust the
    conversion rate and related conversion obligations so that the
    3.75% Notes are convertible into shares of the acquiring or
    surviving company.

Beginning on April 30, 2010 until April 30, 2013, we
    may redeem for cash all or part of the 3.75% Notes at a
    price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and
    unpaid interest, if the closing price of our common stock is
    equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion price then in
    effect for the 3.75% Notes for at least 20 trading days in
    the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day
    immediately prior to the date of mailing of the notice of
    redemption. In addition, we may redeem for cash all or part of
    the 3.75% Notes at any time on or after April 30, 2010
    at certain redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid



interest. Beginning with the six-month interest period
    commencing on April 30, 2010, and for each six-month
    interest period thereafter, we will be required to pay
    contingent interest on any outstanding 3.75% Notes during
    the applicable interest period if the average trading price of
    the 3.75% Notes reaches a specified threshold. The
    contingent interest payable within any applicable interest
    period will equal an annual rate of 0.25% of the average trading
    price of the 3.75% Notes during a five trading day
    reference period.

The holders of the 3.75% Notes may require us to repurchase
    all or a part of the notes in cash on each of April 30,
    2013, April 30, 2016 and April 30, 2021, and in the
    event of a change in control of the company, as defined in the
    indenture, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal
    amount of the 3.75% Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.
    The 3.75% Notes carry cross-default provisions with our
    other debt instruments exceeding $20.0 million in
    borrowings, which includes our existing credit facility.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Transactions

As is common in our industry, we have entered into certain
    off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of
    business that result in risks not directly reflected in our
    balance sheets. Our significant off-balance sheet transactions
    include liabilities associated with non-cancelable operating
    leases, letter of credit obligations, commitments to expand our
    dark fiber network and surety guarantees. We have not engaged in
    any off-balance sheet financing arrangements through special
    purpose entities, and we have no material guarantees of the work
    or obligations of third parties.

Leases

We enter into non-cancelable operating leases for many of our
    facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow us to
    conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of
    facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them.
    We may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of
    its term, in which case we are typically liable to the lessor
    for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease.

We have guaranteed the residual value of the underlying assets
    under certain of our equipment operating leases at the date of
    termination of such leases. We have agreed to pay any difference
    between this residual value and the fair market value of each
    underlying asset as of the lease termination date. As of
    December 31, 2008, the maximum guaranteed residual value
    was approximately $156.6 million. We believe that no
    significant payments will be made as a result of the difference
    between the fair market value of the leased equipment and the
    guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no assurance
    that future significant payments will not be required.

Letters
    of Credit

Certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure
    reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf,
    such as to beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance
    programs. In addition, from time to time some customers require
    us to post letters of credit to ensure payment to our
    subcontractors and vendors under those contracts and to
    guarantee performance under our contracts. Such letters of
    credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial
    institution. The letter of credit commits the issuer to pay
    specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the
    holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified
    actions. If this were to occur, we would be required to
    reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the
    circumstances of such a reimbursement, we may also have to
    record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. We do not
    believe that it is likely that any claims will be made under a
    letter of credit in the foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2008, we had $160.2 million in
    letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility
    primarily to secure obligations under our casualty insurance
    program. These are irrevocable stand-by letters of credit with
    maturities generally expiring at various times throughout 2009.
    Upon maturity, it is expected that the majority of these letters
    of credit will be renewed for subsequent one-year periods.



Performance
    Bonds and Parent Guarantees

Many customers, particularly in connection with new
    construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds
    issued by a financial institution known as a surety. These bonds
    provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under
    the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and
    vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay
    subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the
    surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must
    reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs.
    Under our continuing indemnity and security agreement with our
    sureties and with the consent of our lenders under our credit
    facility, we have granted security interests in certain of our
    assets to collateralize our obligations to the sureties. In
    addition, under our agreement with the surety that issued bonds
    on behalf of InfraSource, which remains in place for any bonds
    that were outstanding under it at the closing of the Merger and
    have not expired or been replaced, we will be required to
    transfer to the surety certain of our assets as collateral in
    the event of a default under the agreement. We may be required
    to post letters of credit or other collateral in favor of the
    sureties or our customers in the future. Posting letters of
    credit in favor of the sureties or our customers would reduce
    the borrowing availability under our credit facility. To date,
    we have not been required to make any reimbursements to our
    sureties for bond-related costs. We believe that it is unlikely
    that we will have to fund significant claims under our surety
    arrangements in the foreseeable future. As of December 31,
    2008, an aggregate of approximately $918.9 million in
    original face amount of bonds issued by our sureties were
    outstanding. Our estimated cost to complete these bonded
    projects was approximately $201.6 million as of
    December 31, 2008.

From time to time, we guarantee the obligations of our wholly
    owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain
    contracts with customers, certain lease obligations and, in some
    states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors
    licenses.

The committed capital expenditures for dark fiber networks
    represent commitments related to signed contracts with
    customers. The amounts are estimates of costs required to build
    the networks under contract. The actual capital expenditures
    related to building the networks could vary materially from
    these estimates.

Actual maturities of our long-term debt may differ from
    contractual maturities because convertible note holders may
    convert their notes prior to the maturity dates or subsequent to
    optional maturity dates.

As of December 31, 2008, the total unrecognized tax benefit
    related to uncertain tax positions was $59.2 million. We
    estimate that none of this will be paid within the next twelve
    months. However, we believe that it is reasonably possible that
    within the next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits will
    decrease up to $24.8 million due to the expiration of
    certain statutes of limitations. We are unable to make
    reasonably reliable estimates regarding the timing of future
    cash outflows, if any, associated with the remaining
    unrecognized tax benefits.



Our multi-employer pension plan contributions are determined
    annually based on our union employee payrolls, which cannot be
    determined in advance for future periods. We may also be
    required to make additional contributions to our multi-employer
    pension plans if they become underfunded. For further
    information, see our risk factor regarding our unionized
    operations in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

Self-Insurance

We are insured for employer’s liability claims, subject to
    a deductible of $1.0 million per occurrence, and for
    general liability and auto liability subject to a deductible of
    $3.0 million per occurrence. We are also insured for
    workers’ compensation claims, subject to a deductible of
    $2.0 million per occurrence. Additionally, we are subject
    to an annual cumulative aggregate liability of up to
    $1.0 million on workers’ compensation claims in excess
    of $2.0 million per occurrence. We also have employee
    health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is
    subject to a deductible of $350,000 per claimant per year.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported
    and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
    assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance
    liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
    factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination
    of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of
    incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety
    program. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical
    trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate. As
    of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008, the gross
    amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $152.0 million
    and $147.9 million, with $110.1 million and
    $105.0 million considered to be long-term and included in
    other non-current liabilities. Related insurance
    recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2008 were $22.1 million and
    $12.5 million, of which $11.9 million and
    $7.2 million are included in prepaid expenses and other
    current assets and $10.2 million and $5.3 million are
    included in other assets, net.

Our casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods from
    August 1, 2000 to February 28, 2003 has experienced
    financial distress. Effective September 29, 2008, Quanta
    consummated a novation transaction that released this distressed
    casualty insurance carrier from all further obligations in
    connection with the policies in effect during that period in
    exchange for the payment to us of an agreed amount. Our current
    casualty insurance carrier assumed all obligations under the
    policies in effect during that period; however, we are obligated
    to indemnify the carrier in full for any liabilities under the
    policies assumed. At December 31, 2008, we estimated that
    the total future claim amounts associated with the novated
    policies was $6.8 million, based on an estimate of the
    potential range of these future claim amounts at
    December 31, 2008 of between $2.0 million and
    $8.0 million. The actual amounts ultimately paid by us in
    connection with these claims, if any, could vary materially from
    the above range and could be impacted by further claims
    development. During the second quarter of 2008, we recorded an
    allowance of $3.4 million for potentially uncollectible
    amounts estimated to be ultimately due from the distressed
    insurer. As a result of the novation transaction, the net
    receivable balance remaining was written off in the third
    quarter of 2008, with an immaterial impact to the three month
    period ended September 30, 2008 and the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

We are subject to concentrations of credit risk related
    primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and accounts
    receivable. Substantially all of our cash investments are
    managed by what we believe to be high credit quality financial
    institutions. In accordance with our investment policies, these
    institutions are authorized to invest this cash in a diversified
    portfolio of what we believe to be high quality investments,
    which primarily include interest-bearing demand deposits, money
    market mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper with
    original maturities of three months or less. Although we do not
    currently believe the principal amount of these investments is
    subject to any material risk of loss, the recent volatility in
    the financial markets is likely to significantly impact the
    interest income we receive from these investments. In addition,
    we grant credit under normal payment terms, generally without
    collateral, to our customers, which include electric power and
    gas companies, telecommunications and cable television system
    operators, governmental entities, general contractors, and
    builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial
    properties located primarily in



the United States. Consequently, we are subject to potential
    credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors
    throughout the United States, which may be heightened as a
    result of the current financial crisis and volatility of the
    markets. However, we generally have certain statutory lien
    rights with respect to services provided. Under certain
    circumstances, such as foreclosures or negotiated settlements,
    we may take title to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in
    settlement of receivables. In such circumstances, extended time
    frames may be required to liquidate these assets, causing the
    amounts realized to differ from the value of the assumed
    receivable. Historically, some of our customers have experienced
    significant financial difficulties, and others may experience
    financial difficulties in the future. These difficulties expose
    us to increased risk related to collectability of receivables
    for services we have performed. No customer accounted for more
    than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2008 or
    revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 or
    2008.

Litigation

We are from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and
    other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These actions typically seek, among other things,
    compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract

and/or

property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
    losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all
    such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record reserves when
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not believe that any
    of these proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, would be
    expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Related
    Party Transactions

In the normal course of business, we enter into transactions
    from time to time with related parties. These transactions
    typically take the form of facility leases with prior owners of
    certain acquired companies and payables to prior owners who are
    now employees.

Inflation

Due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, inflation did
    not have a significant effect on our results.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157
    defines fair value, establishes methods used to measure fair
    value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
    periods, as it relates to financial assets and liabilities, as
    well as for any non-financial assets and liabilities that are
    carried at fair value. SFAS No. 157 also requires
    certain tabular disclosure related to the application of
    SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” and SFAS No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” On
    November 14, 2007, the FASB provided a one year deferral
    for the implementation of SFAS No. 157 for
    non-financial assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157
    excludes from its scope SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),
    “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R)) and
    its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address
    share-based payment transactions. We adopted
    SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008 as it applies to
    our financial assets and liabilities, and based on the
    November 14, 2007 deferral of SFAS No. 157 for
    non-financial assets and liabilities, we will begin following
    the guidance of SFAS No. 157 with respect to our
    non-financial assets and liabilities in the quarter ended
    March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, we had no
    material financial assets and liabilities on our balance sheet
    carried at fair value other than cash and cash equivalents
    balances which are disclosed as Level 1 assets in
    Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, and
    therefore the partial adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not
    have a material impact on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, we do not
    currently have any material non-financial assets or liabilities
    that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis; however, we
    do have non-financial assets that are evaluated against measures
    of fair value on a non-recurring or as-needed basis, including
    goodwill, other intangibles and



long-term assets held and used. Based on the financial and
    non-financial assets and liabilities on our balance sheet as of
    December 31, 2008, we do not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP

FAS 157-3

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset Is Not Active.” FSP

FAS 157-3

provides clarifying guidance with respect to the application of
    SFAS No. 157 in determining the fair value of a
    financial asset when the market for that asset in not active.
    FSP

FAS 157-3

was effective upon its issuance. The application of FSP

FAS 157-3

did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows as of and for the
    year ended December 31, 2008 and is not expected to have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows in the near-term.

On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB No. 115.”
    SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure at
    fair value many financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value that were not previously required to be measured at
    fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the
    fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings.
    SFAS No. 159 does not affect any existing accounting
    literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be
    carried at fair value. The adoption of SFAS No. 159
    did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows as of and for the
    year ended December 31, 2008 and is not expected to have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows in the near-term.

On January 1, 2008, we adopted EITF Issue

No. 06-11,

“Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
    Share-Based Payment Awards.”

EITF 06-11

requires that a realized income tax benefit from dividends or
    dividend equivalent units paid on unvested restricted shares and
    restricted share units be reflected as an increase in
    contributed surplus and as an addition to the company’s
    excess tax benefit pool, as defined under
    SFAS No. 123(R). Because we did not declare any
    dividends during 2008 and do not currently anticipate declaring
    dividends in the near future, the adoption of

EITF 06-11

did not have any impact during the year ended December 31,
    2008, and is not expected to have a material impact in the
    near-term, on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51.”
    SFAS No. 160 addresses the accounting and reporting
    framework for minority interests by a parent company.
    SFAS No. 160 is to be effective for fiscal years, and
    interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008. Accordingly, we adopted
    SFAS No. 160 on January 1, 2009, with no material
    impact to our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows on the date of adoption. As we do not
    currently have any material subsidiaries with non-controlling
    interests, the adoption of SFAS No. 160 is not
    anticipated to have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the
    near-term.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141(R) is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, and accordingly, we adopted SFAS No. 141(R) on
    January 1, 2009. Earlier application was prohibited, and
    assets and liabilities that arose from business combinations
    occurring prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R)
    cannot be adjusted upon the adoption of
    SFAS No. 141(R). SFAS No. 141(R) requires
    the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all
    (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the
    business combination; establishes the acquisition date as the
    measurement date to determine the fair value for all assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to
    disclose to investors and other users all of the information
    needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial
    effect of the business combination. As it relates to recognizing
    all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
    business combination, costs an acquirer expects but is not
    obligated to incur in the future to exit an activity of an
    acquiree or to terminate or relocate an acquiree’s
    employees are not liabilities at the acquisition date but must
    be expensed in accordance with other applicable generally
    accepted accounting principles. If the initial accounting for a
    business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting
    period in which the combination occurs, the acquirer must report
    in its financial statements provisional amounts for the items
    for which the accounting is incomplete. During the measurement
    period, which must not exceed one year from the acquisition
    date, the acquirer will retrospectively adjust the



provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to
    reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances
    that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would
    have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of
    that date. The acquirer will be required to expense all
    acquisition-related costs in the periods such costs are
    incurred, other than costs to issue debt or equity securities in
    connection with the acquisition. SFAS No. 141(R) is
    not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows at the
    date of adoption, but we expect that it may have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows as a result of acquisitions in future
    periods.

In December 2007, the SEC published Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (SAB) No. 110 (SAB 110). SAB 110 expresses the
    views of the SEC staff regarding the use of a
    “simplified” method, as discussed in
    SAB No. 107 (SAB 107), in developing an estimate
    of the expected term of “plain vanilla” share options
    in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). In particular, the
    SEC staff indicated in SAB 107 that it will accept a
    company’s election to use the simplified method, regardless
    of whether the company has sufficient information to make more
    refined estimates of the expected term. However, the SEC staff
    stated in SAB 107 that it would not expect a company to use
    the simplified method for share option grants after
    December 31, 2007. In SAB 110, the SEC staff states
    that they would continue to accept, under certain circumstances,
    the use of the simplified method beyond December 31, 2007.
    Because we did not issue any stock options in 2008, SAB 110
    had no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows in 2008. Furthermore, because we
    currently do not anticipate issuing stock options in the near
    future, SAB 110 is not anticipated to have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows in the near-term.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — An Amendment of FASB No. 133.”
    SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures to enable
    investors to better understand how a reporting entity’s
    derivative instruments and hedging activities impact the
    entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash
    flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial
    statements issued after November 15, 2008, including
    interim financial statements. We adopted SFAS No. 161
    on January 1, 2009, with no material impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows on the date of adoption. As we have not entered into any
    material derivatives or hedging activities and do not currently
    anticipate doing so, the adoption of SFAS No. 161 is
    not anticipated to have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, cash flows or
    disclosures.

In April 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets.”

FSP 142-3

amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset under
    SFAS No. 142. The intent of

FSP 142-3

is to improve the consistency between the useful life of an
    intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to
    measure its fair value and to enhance existing disclosure
    requirements relating to intangible assets.

FSP 142-3

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008 and should be applied prospectively to intangible assets
    acquired after the effective date. Early adoption is prohibited.
    Accordingly, we adopted

FSP 142-3

on January 1, 2009.

FSP 142-3

did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows at the date of adoption, but
    we expect that it may have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows in
    future periods.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.”
    SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting
    principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be
    used in the preparation of financial statements of
    non-governmental entities that are presented in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
    SFAS No. 162 will be effective 60 days following
    the SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, “The
    Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles.” We will adopt
    SFAS No. 162 once it is effective, but we have not yet
    determined the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial
    statements.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FSP APB

14-1,

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement).” FSP APB

14-1

requires issuers of such instruments to separately account for
    the liability and equity components in



a manner that will reflect the entity’s non-convertible
    debt borrowing rate and interest cost. The value of the equity
    component is recognized with an offsetting discount to the face
    value of the debt, which will be amortized as non-cash interest
    expense over the expected life of the debt.

FSP APB 14-1

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods
    within those fiscal years, and will be applied retrospectively
    to all periods presented. Accordingly, we adopted FSP APB

14-1

on
    January 1, 2009 and will apply FSP APB

14-1

retrospectively to all periods presented in future filings. We
    will record a cumulative effect of the change in accounting
    principle as of January 1, 2007 of approximately
    $29.6 million and non-cash interest expense of
    approximately $17.8 million ($11.3 million after-tax)
    and $14.5 million ($9.2 million after-tax) for the
    years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008. In addition, we
    will record additional non-cash interest expense annually
    thereafter until our 3.75% Notes are redeemable at the
    holder’s option in April 2013, with approximately
    $4.3 million ($2.7 million after-tax) to be recorded
    in 2009.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP

EITF 03-6-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities.” FSP

EITF 03-6-1 states

that unvested share-based payment awards that contain
    non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
    (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities under the
    definition of SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per
    Share” and should be included in the computation of both
    basic and diluted earnings per share. FSP

EITF 03-6-1

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods
    within those years. Accordingly, we adopted FSP

EITF 03-6-1

on January 1, 2009. All prior period earnings per share
    data presented will be adjusted retrospectively to conform to
    the provisions of FSP

EITF 03-6-1.

Early application was not permitted. All of our restricted stock
    grants have non-forfeitable rights to dividends and are
    considered participating securities under FSP

EITF 03-06-1.

Through December 31, 2008, any unvested restricted stock
    grants are accounted for under the treasury stock method. Under
    this method unvested restricted common shares were not included
    in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding
    and were included in the calculation of weighted average diluted
    shares outstanding to the extent the grant price was less than
    the average share price for the respective period. Beginning in
    the first quarter of 2009, under FSP ETIF

03-6-1,

we
    will retrospectively restate earnings per share data for all
    prior and future periods presented to include all participating
    unvested restricted common shares in the calculation of weighted
    average basic and dilutive shares outstanding. The impact of the
    retrospective application of FSP ETIF

03-6-1

on
    earnings per share is anticipated to be immaterial.

In June 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue

07-5,

“Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is
    Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock”

(EITF 07-5).

The primary objective of

EITF 07-5

is to provide guidance for determining whether an equity-linked
    financial instrument or embedded feature within a contract is
    indexed to an entity’s own stock, which is a key criterion
    of the scope exception to paragraph 11(a) of
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities.” This criterion is also
    important in evaluating whether

EITF 00-19,

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
    to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock”
    applies to certain financial instruments that are not
    derivatives under SFAS No. 133. An equity-linked
    financial instrument or embedded feature within a contract that
    is not considered indexed to an entity’s own stock could be
    required to be classified as an asset or liability and
    marked-to-market through earnings.

EITF 07-5

specifies a two-step approach in evaluating whether an
    equity-linked financial instrument or embedded feature within a
    contract is indexed to its own stock. The first step involves
    evaluating the instrument’s contingent exercise provisions,
    if any, and the second step involves evaluating the
    instrument’s settlement provisions.

EITF 07-5

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, and must be applied to
    all instruments outstanding as of the effective date.
    Accordingly, we adopted

EITF 07-5

on January 1, 2009, with no material impact to our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows on the date of adoption. We also do not anticipate the
    adoption of

EITF 07-5

to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows in the near-term.

In November 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue

08-6,

“Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations”

(EITF 08-06).

EITF 08-6

requires that the initial measurement of an equity method
    investment be at cost in accordance with
    SFAS No. 141(R). It also requires that an equity
    method investor recognize



other-than-temporary impairments of an equity method investment
    in accordance with paragraph 19(h) of APB Opinion 18.
    Additionally, an equity method investor shall not separately
    test an investee’s underlying indefinite-lived intangible
    assets for impairment, and an equity method investor shall
    account for a share issuance by an investee as if the investor
    had sold a proportionate share of its investment. Any gain or
    loss to the investor resulting from an investee’s share
    issuance shall be recognized in earnings, subject to certain
    exceptions.

EITF 08-6

is effective on a prospective basis in fiscal years beginning on
    or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within
    those fiscal years. Accordingly, we adopted

EITF 08-6

on January 1, 2009, with no material impact to our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows on the date of adoption. We also do not anticipate the
    adoption of

EITF 08-6

to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows in the near term.

In November 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue

08-7,

“Accounting for Defensible Intangible Assets.”

EITF 08-7

requires that a defensible intangible asset should be accounted
    for as a separate unit of account rather than as part of the
    cost of an acquirer’s existing intangible assets and that
    the useful life assigned to such defensible intangible asset
    should reflect the entity’s consumption of the expected
    benefits related to the asset.

EITF 08-7

is effective on a prospective basis in fiscal years beginning on
    or after December 15, 2008. Accordingly, we adopted

EITF 08-7

on January 1, 2009, with no impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows at the
    date of adoption. We anticipate that the adoption of

EITF 08-7

may have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows in the future when
    it is applied to acquisitions which occur in future periods.

In November 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue

08-8,

“Accounting for an Instrument (or an Embedded Feature) with
    a Settlement Amount That is Based on the Stock of an
    Entity’s Consolidated Subsidiary.”

EITF 08-8

provides guidance regarding the accounting for a financial
    instrument or embedded feature when it is indexed to a
    subsidiary considered to be a substantive entity in that such
    instrument or feature is not precluded from being considered
    indexed to the entity’s own stock in the consolidated
    financial statements of the parent. Additionally, an
    equity-classified instrument or feature within the scope of

EITF 08-8

shall be presented as a component of noncontrolling interest in
    the consolidated financial statements, whether the instrument
    was entered into by the parent or subsidiary.

EITF 08-8

is effective in fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008. Accordingly, we adopted

EITF 08-8

on January 1, 2009, with no impact to our consolidated
    financial position on the date of adoption because we had no
    such instruments or embedded features at December 31, 2008.
    We also do not expect the adoption of

EITF 08-8

to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows in the near-term.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
    results of operations are based on our consolidated financial
    statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
    The preparation of these consolidated financial statements
    requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of
    contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date
    the consolidated financial statements are published and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the
    periods presented. We review all significant estimates affecting
    our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and
    record the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their
    publication. Judgments and estimates are based on our beliefs
    and assumptions derived from information available at the time
    such judgments and estimates are made. Uncertainties with
    respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the
    preparation of financial statements. There can be no assurance
    that actual results will not differ from those estimates.
    Management has reviewed its development and selection of
    critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our
    Board of Directors. We believe the following accounting policies
    affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the
    preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

Revenue
    Recognition

Infrastructure Services — We design, install and
    maintain networks for the electric power, gas,
    telecommunications and cable television industries, as well as
    provide various ancillary services to commercial,



industrial and governmental entities. These services may be
    provided pursuant to master service agreements, repair and
    maintenance contracts and fixed price and non-fixed price
    installation contracts. Pricing under these contracts may be
    competitive unit price, cost-plus/hourly (or time and materials
    basis) or fixed price (or lump sum basis), and the final terms
    and prices of these contracts are frequently negotiated with the
    customer. Under unit-based contracts, the utilization of an
    output-based measurement is appropriate for revenue recognition.
    Under these contracts, we recognize revenue when units are
    completed based on pricing established between us and the
    customer for each unit of delivery, which best reflects the
    pattern in which the obligation to the customer is fulfilled.
    Under our cost-plus/hourly and time and materials type
    contracts, we recognize revenue on an input-basis, as labor
    hours are incurred and services are performed.

Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the
    percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of
    costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each
    contract. These contracts provide for a fixed amount of revenues
    for the entire project. Such contracts provide that the customer
    accept completion of progress to date and compensate us for
    services rendered, measured in terms of units installed, hours
    expended or some other measure of progress. Contract costs
    include all direct material, labor and subcontract costs and
    those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as
    indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs.
    Much of the materials associated with our work are
    owner-furnished and are therefore not included in contract
    revenues and costs. The cost estimation process is based on the
    professional knowledge and experience of our engineers, project
    managers and financial professionals. Changes in job
    performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are
    factors that influence management’s assessment of the total
    estimated costs to complete those contracts and therefore, our
    profit recognition. Changes in these factors may result in
    revisions to costs and income and their effects are recognized
    in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions
    for the total estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made
    in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable
    and can be reasonably estimated. If actual results significantly
    differ from our estimates used for revenue recognition and claim
    assessments, our financial condition and results of operations
    could be materially impacted.

We may incur costs related to change orders, whether approved or
    unapproved by the customer,

and/or

claims related to certain contracts. We determine the
    probability that such costs will be recovered based upon
    evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific
    discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer or
    verbal approvals. We treat items as a cost of contract
    performance in the period incurred if it is not probable that
    the costs will be recovered or will recognize revenue if it is
    probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be
    reliably estimated.

The current asset “Costs and estimated earnings in excess
    of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents revenues
    recognized in excess of amounts billed for fixed price
    contracts. The current liability “Billings in excess of
    costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts”
    represents billings in excess of revenues recognized for fixed
    price contracts.

Dark Fiber — Quanta has fiber-optic facility licensing
    agreements with various customers, pursuant to which it
    recognizes revenues, including any initial fees or advance
    billings, ratably over the expected length of the agreements,
    including probable renewal periods. As of December 31, 2007
    and 2008, initial fees and advanced billings on these licensing
    agreements not yet recorded in revenue were $23.2 million
    and $34.6 million and are recognized as deferred revenue,
    with $15.6 million and $25.1 million considered to be
    long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Actual
    revenues may differ from those estimates if the contracts are
    not renewed as expected.

Self-Insurance.

We are insured for
    employer’s liability claims, subject to a deductible of
    $1.0 million per occurrence, and for general liability and
    auto liability subject to a deductible of $3.0 million per
    occurrence. We are also insured for workers’ compensation
    claims, subject to a deductible of $2.0 million per
    occurrence. Additionally, we are subject to an annual cumulative
    aggregate liability of up to $1.0 million on workers’
    compensation claims in excess of $2.0 million per
    occurrence. We also have employee health care benefit plans for
    most employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements,
    of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $350,000
    per claimant per year.



Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported
    and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
    assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance
    liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
    factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination
    of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of
    incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety
    program. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical
    trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate. As
    of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008, the gross
    amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $152.0 million
    and $147.9 million, with $110.1 million and
    $105.0 million considered to be long-term and included in
    other non-current liabilities. Related insurance
    recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2008 were $22.1 million and
    $12.5 million, of which $11.9 million and
    $7.2 million are included in prepaid expenses and other
    current assets and $10.2 million and $5.3 million are
    included in other assets, net.

Our casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods from
    August 1, 2000 to February 28, 2003 has experienced
    financial distress. Effective September 29, 2008, Quanta
    consummated a novation transaction that released this distressed
    casualty insurance carrier from all further obligations in
    connection with the policies in effect during that period in
    exchange for the payment to us of an agreed amount. Our current
    casualty insurance carrier assumed all obligations under the
    policies in effect during that period; however, we are obligated
    to indemnify the carrier in full for any liabilities under the
    policies assumed. At December 31, 2008, we estimated that
    the total future claim amounts associated with the novated
    policies was $6.8 million, based on an estimate of the
    potential range of these future claim amounts at
    December 31, 2008 of between $2.0 million and
    $8.0 million. The actual amounts ultimately paid by us in
    connection with these claims, if any, could vary materially from
    the above range and could be impacted by further claims
    development. During the second quarter of 2008, we recorded an
    allowance of $3.4 million for potentially uncollectible
    amounts estimated to be ultimately due from the distressed
    insurer. As a result of the novation transaction, the net
    receivable balance remaining was written off in the third
    quarter of 2008, with an immaterial impact to the three month
    period ended September 30, 2008 and the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

Valuation of Intangibles and Long-Lived
    Assets.

SFAS No. 142 provides that
    goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful
    lives not be amortized but, instead, must be tested at least
    annually for impairment, and intangible assets that have finite
    useful lives should continue to be amortized over their useful
    lives. SFAS No. 142 also provides specific guidance
    for testing goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets
    for impairment. The first step compares the fair value of a
    reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If
    the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
    the second step is then performed. The second step compares the
    carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the
    fair value of the goodwill. If the fair value of the goodwill is
    less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be
    recorded in income (loss) from operations in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

SFAS No. 142 does not allow increases in the carrying
    value of reporting units that may result from our impairment
    test; therefore, we may record goodwill impairments in the
    future, even when the aggregate fair value of our reporting
    units and the company as a whole may increase. Goodwill of a
    reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual
    tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more
    likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below
    its carrying amount. Examples of such events or circumstances
    may include a significant change in business climate, loss of a
    significant customer or a loss of key personnel, among others.
    Additionally, a decrease in market capitalization below book
    value may trigger the need for interim impairment testing.
    SFAS No. 142 requires that management make certain
    estimates and assumptions in order to allocate goodwill to
    reporting units and to determine the fair value of reporting
    unit net assets and liabilities, including, among other things,
    an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, cost
    of capital and growth rates, which could significantly impact
    the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. When
    necessary, we engage third party specialists to assist us with
    our valuations. The valuations employ a combination of present
    value techniques and market multiple techniques to measure fair
    value. These valuations are based on a discount rate determined
    by management to be consistent with industry discount rates and
    the risks inherent in our current business model. A provision
    for impairment could be required in a future period if future
    operating results and residual values differ from our estimates.
    Intangible



assets with definite lives are also reviewed for impairment if
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount may not be realizable.

As part of our 2006 annual test for goodwill impairment,
    goodwill in the amount of $56.8 million was written off as
    a non-cash operating expense associated with a decrease in the
    expected future demand for the services of one of our
    businesses, which had historically served the cable television
    industry. This operating unit had transitioned to FTTN and FTTP
    deployments for our customers and had previously forecasted
    expectations to begin deployments of the broadband over power
    line (BPL) technology in late 2005. However, because the
    prospective BPL customers were still analyzing the costs and
    benefits of using this technology at the end of 2006, management
    determined the BPL work would be delayed. With the future
    revenue growth related to BPL delayed, and the resulting impact
    on projected cash flows reduced at December 31, 2006,
    management determined that the estimated fair value of the
    reporting unit was less than its carrying value and,
    consequently, a goodwill impairment charge was recognized. For
    this operating unit, the remaining unimpaired balance of
    goodwill is $30.3 million. This operating unit, as well as
    others that had previously served the cable television industry,
    had successfully expanded its services to include FTTN and FTTP
    services and therefore, currently operates with sufficient cash
    flows to support any remaining goodwill balances.

Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and
    our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized.
    Changes in our judgments and projections could result in a
    significantly different estimate of the fair value of reporting
    units and intangible assets and could result in an impairment.
    Variances in the assessment of market conditions, projected cash
    flows, cost of capital, growth rates and acquisition multiples
    applied could have an impact on the assessment of impairments
    and any amount of goodwill impairment charges recorded. For
    example, lower growth rates, lower acquisition multiples or
    higher costs of capital assumptions would all individually lead
    to lower fair value assessments and potentially increased
    frequency or size of goodwill impairments. Any goodwill or other
    intangible impairment would be included in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

Our goodwill is included in multiple reporting units. Due to the
    cyclical nature of our business, and the other factors described
    under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A, the
    profitability of our individual reporting units may suffer from
    downturns in customer demand and other factors. These factors
    may have a disproportionate impact on the individual reporting
    units as compared to Quanta as a whole and might adversely
    affect the fair value of the individual reporting units. If
    material adverse conditions occur that impact our reporting
    units, our future estimates of fair value may not support the
    carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units, and the
    related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount
    considered recoverable.

The estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their
    carrying value for the annual goodwill impairment test at
    December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we believe
    the goodwill is recoverable for all of the reporting units,
    however there can be no assurances that the goodwill will not be
    impaired in future periods.

We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
    not be realizable. If an evaluation is required, the estimated
    future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are
    compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if an
    impairment of such asset is necessary. This requires us to make
    long-term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to
    the assets subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions
    about demand for our products and future market conditions.
    Since estimating future cash flows requires significant
    judgment, our projections may vary from cash flows eventually
    realized. Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions
    could require a provision for impairment in a future period. The
    effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference
    between the fair value of such asset and its carrying value.
    Such expense would be reflected in income (loss) from operations
    in the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, we
    estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets and other
    intangibles and periodically review these estimates to determine
    whether these lives are appropriate.

Current and Non-Current Accounts and Notes Receivable and
    Provision for Doubtful Accounts.

We provide an
    allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account or
    note receivable is considered doubtful, and receivables are
    written off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible.
    Inherent in the



assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain
    judgments and estimates including, among others, our
    customer’s access to capital, our customer’s
    willingness or ability to pay, general economic conditions and
    the ongoing relationship with the customer. Under certain
    circumstances such as foreclosure or negotiated settlements, we
    may take title to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in
    settlement of receivables. Material changes in Quanta’s
    customers’ business of cash flows, which may be further
    impacted by the current financial crisis and volatility of the
    markets, could affect its ability to collect amounts due from
    them. Certain of our customers, several of them large public
    telecommunications carriers and utility customers, have
    experienced financial difficulties in the past. Should any major
    customers experience difficulties or file for bankruptcy, or
    should anticipated recoveries relating to the receivables in
    existing bankruptcies and other workout situations fail to
    materialize, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses
    in excess of current reserves.

Income Taxes.

We follow the liability method
    of accounting for income taxes in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
    Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    recorded for future tax consequences of temporary differences
    between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
    liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and
    laws that are expected to be in effect when the underlying
    assets or liabilities are recovered or settled.

We regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for
    deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain.
    The estimation of required valuation allowances includes
    estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of
    deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
    taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
    differences become deductible. We consider projected future
    taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
    assessment. If actual future taxable income differs from our
    estimates, we may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent
    estimated.

On January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — An Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109 (FIN No. 48). FIN No. 48
    prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should
    recognize, measure, present and disclose in their financial
    statements uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on a tax
    return. We record reserves for expected tax consequences of such
    uncertain positions assuming the taxing authorities’ full
    knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.

The income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and are often
    ambiguous. As such, we are required to make many subjective
    assumptions and judgments regarding our tax positions that can
    materially affect amounts recognized in our future consolidated
    balance sheets and statements of operations.

Outlook

Over the past two years, many utilities across the country
    increased or indicated plans to increase spending on their
    transmission and distribution systems, with a more significant
    focus on the upgrade and build-out of the transmission grid. As
    a result, new construction, pole change-outs, line upgrades and
    maintenance projects on many systems are occurring. While we
    expect this trend to continue over the next few quarters,
    capital constraints impacting our customers as a result of the
    current economic downturn could slow this spending, particularly
    in connection with their distribution systems.

We believe that renewable energy initiatives, including wind and
    solar, will create opportunities over the long-term for us to
    provide engineering, project management and installation
    services for renewable projects. State mandates, which set
    standards for how much power is required to be generated from
    renewable energy sources, as well as general environmental
    concerns, are driving the development of additional renewable
    energy projects. While the latter part of 2008 experienced a
    decline in renewable energy spending, we expect future spending
    on renewable energy initiatives to increase, although
    investments could be impacted by capital constraints if the
    financial markets continue to deteriorate.

We also anticipate increased spending over the next decade as a
    result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the Energy Act), which
    requires the power industry to meet federal reliability
    standards for its transmission and distribution systems and
    provides further incentives to the industry to invest in and
    improve maintenance



on its systems, although rule-making initiatives under the
    Energy Act could be impacted, both in timing and in scope, by
    the new presidential administration. Additionally, we expect the
    construction of renewable energy facilities, including wind and
    solar power generation, to result in the need for additional
    transmission lines and substations. As a result of these and
    other factors, we expect a continued shift in our services mix
    to a greater proportion of high-voltage electric power
    transmission and substation projects over the long-term, as well
    as opportunities to provide installation services for renewable
    projects. Many of these projects have a long-term horizon, and
    timing and scope can be negatively affected by numerous factors,
    including regulatory permitting, availability of funding and the
    effect of negative economic and market conditions.

We believe that certain provisions of the American Recovery and
    Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), enacted in February 2009, will
    also increase demand for our services over the long-term. The
    economic stimulus programs under the ARRA include incentives in
    the form of direct spending and tax cuts and credits for
    renewable energy, energy efficiency and electric power and
    telecommunications infrastructure. For example, the ARRA
    extended tax credits for wind projects until 2012, which we
    expect will encourage further development in wind energy. Funds
    provided to the states for the restoration, repair and
    construction of highways will also likely require the relocation
    and upgrade of electric power, telecommunications and natural
    gas infrastructure. We anticipate investments in many of these
    initiatives to create opportunities for our operations, although
    we cannot predict the timing of the implementation of the
    programs that support these investments or the timing or scope
    of the investments once the programs are implemented.

Several industry and market trends are also prompting customers
    in the electric power industry to seek outsourcing partners,
    such as us. These trends include an aging utility workforce,
    increasing volumes of work, increasing costs and labor issues.
    The need to ensure available labor resources for larger projects
    is also driving strategic relationships with customers.

We also see potential growth opportunities in our gas
    operations, primarily in natural gas gathering and pipeline
    installation and maintenance services, although recently this
    business has been negatively impacted by lower natural gas
    prices and capital constraints on spending by our customers. In
    the past, our gas operations have been challenged by lower
    margins overall, due in part to our gas distribution services
    that have been impacted by certain lower margin contracts and by
    recent declines in new housing construction in certain sectors
    of the country. We have allocated resources to more profitable
    services, and we are optimistic about these operations in the
    future, although economic and market conditions as well as the
    level of natural gas prices may continue to negatively affect
    this business in the near-term.

In the telecommunications industry, various initiatives are
    underway by several wireline carriers and government
    organizations that provide us with opportunities, in particular,
    initiatives for fiber to the premises (FTTP) and fiber to the
    node (FTTN). Such initiatives have been underway by Verizon,
    AT&T and other telecommunications providers, and
    municipalities and other government jurisdictions have also
    become active in these initiatives. Since the second quarter of
    2008, we have seen a significant slow-down in FTTP and FTTN
    deployment, and we anticipate this slow-down to continue if
    economic and market conditions remain stagnant or further
    deteriorate. In connection with our wireless operations, several
    wireless companies have announced plans to increase their cell
    site deployments over the next few years, including the
    expansion of next generation technology. We anticipate increased
    opportunities from these plans over the long-term, with the
    timing and amount of spending on these plans somewhat dependent
    on future economic and market conditions.

We anticipate that the future initiatives by the
    telecommunication carriers will serve as a catalyst for the
    cable industry to begin a new network upgrade cycle to expand
    its service offerings in an effort to retain and attract
    customers; however, the timing of any upgrades is uncertain.

Our Dark Fiber segment is also experiencing growth primarily
    through the expansion into additional geographic markets, with a
    focus within those markets on education and healthcare customers
    where secure high-speed networks are important. We continue to
    see opportunities for growth both in the markets we currently
    serve and new markets, although we cannot predict the negative
    impact, if any, of the current economic downturn on these growth
    opportunities. To support the growth in this business, we
    anticipate the need for continued significant capital
    expenditures. Our Dark Fiber segment typically generates higher
    margins



than our Infrastructure Services segment, but we can give no
    assurance that the Dark Fiber segment margins will continue at
    historical levels.

Historically, our customers have continued to spend throughout
    short-term economic softness or weak recessions. A long-term or
    deep recession, however, would likely have some negative impact
    on our customers’ spending. In addition, the volatility of
    the capital markets may negatively affect our customers’
    plans for future projects, which could be delayed, reduced or
    suspended if funding is not available. It is uncertain when and
    to what extent the current unfavorable economic and market
    conditions will improve, or if they will deteriorate further.
    Despite reductions in capital spending by some of our customers,
    our revenues in certain of the industries we serve may not
    decline, as utilities continue outsourcing more of their work,
    in part due to their aging workforce issues. Additionally, many
    of the capital expenditure reductions announced by utilities
    relate to power generation and areas other than transmission and
    distribution systems, and therefore, we may not be significantly
    impacted by these reductions. We believe that we remain the
    partner of choice for many utilities in need of broad
    infrastructure expertise, specialty equipment and workforce
    resources. Furthermore, as new technologies emerge in the future
    for communications and digital services such as voice, video and
    data, telecommunications and cable service providers are
    expected to work quickly to deploy fast, next-generation fiber
    networks, and we are recognized as a key partner in deploying
    these services.

With the growth in several of our markets and our margin
    enhancement initiatives, we continue to see our gross margins
    generally improve, although reductions in spending by our
    customers, particularly in our telecommunications operations,
    could negatively affect our margins. We continue to focus on the
    elements of the business we can control, including costs, the
    margins we accept on projects, collecting receivables, ensuring
    quality service and rightsizing initiatives to match the markets
    we serve. These initiatives include aligning our workforce with
    our current revenue base, evaluating opportunities to reduce the
    number of field offices and evaluating our non-core assets for
    potential sale. Such initiatives could result in future charges
    related to, among other things, severance, retention, the
    shutdown and consolidation of facilities, property disposal and
    other exit costs.

Capital expenditures for 2009 are expected to be approximately
    $180 million, of which $85 million of these
    expenditures are targeted for dark fiber network expansion with
    the majority of the remaining expenditures for operating
    equipment in the Infrastructure Services segment. We expect 2009
    capital expenditures to continue to be funded substantially
    through internal cash flows and cash on hand.

On August 30, 2007, we consummated the Merger with
    InfraSource, which enhanced our resources and expanded our
    service portfolio through InfraSource’s complementary
    businesses, strategic geographic footprint and skilled
    workforce. We have already begun to realize the benefits of the
    Merger through additional opportunities, and we continue to
    expect that the combined company will be able to better serve
    our customers as demand grows in their respective industries.

We continue to evaluate other potential strategic acquisitions
    of companies to broaden our customer base, expand our geographic
    area of operation and grow our portfolio of services. We believe
    that additional attractive acquisition candidates exist
    primarily as a result of the highly fragmented nature of the
    industry, the inability of many companies to expand and
    modernize due to capital constraints and the desire of owners of
    acquisition candidates for liquidity. We also believe that our
    financial strength and experienced management team will be
    attractive to acquisition candidates.

We believe that we are adequately positioned to capitalize upon
    opportunities and trends in the industries we serve because of
    our proven full-service operating units with broad geographic
    reach, financial capability and technical expertise.
    Additionally, we believe that these industry opportunities and
    trends will increase the demand for our services; however, we
    cannot predict the actual timing, magnitude or impact these
    opportunities and trends will have on our operating results and
    financial position, especially in light of the economic downturn
    and volatile capital markets.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our primary exposure to market risk relates to unfavorable
    changes in concentration of credit risk, interest rates and
    currency exchange rates. We are currently not exposed to any
    significant market risks or interest rate risk from the use of
    derivatives.

Credit Risk.

We are subject to concentrations
    of credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalents and
    accounts receivable. Substantially all of our cash investments
    are managed by what we believe to be high credit quality
    financial institutions. In accordance with our investment
    policies, these institutions are authorized to invest this cash
    in a diversified portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality
    investments, which primarily include interest-bearing demand
    deposits, money market mutual funds and investment grade
    commercial paper with original maturities of three months or
    less. Although we do not currently believe the principal amounts
    of these investments are subject to any material risk of loss,
    the recent volatility in the financial markets is likely to
    significantly impact the interest income we receive from these
    investments. In addition, as we grant credit under normal
    payment terms, generally with collateral, we are subject to
    potential credit risk related to our customers’ ability to
    pay for services provided. This risk may be heightened as a
    result of the current financial crisis and volatility of the
    markets. However, we believe the concentration of credit risk
    related to trade accounts receivable is limited because of the
    diversity of our customers. We perform ongoing credit risk
    assessments of our customers and financial institutions and
    obtain collateral or other security from our customers when
    appropriate.

Interest Rate.

Our exposure to market rate
    risk for changes in interest rates relates to our convertible
    subordinated notes. The fair market value of our fixed rate
    convertible subordinated notes is subject to interest rate risk
    because of their fixed interest rate and market risk due to the
    convertible feature of our convertible subordinated notes.
    Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt
    will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest
    rates rise. The fair market value of our convertible
    subordinated notes will also increase as the market price of our
    stock increases and decrease as the market price falls. The
    interest and market value changes affect the fair market value
    of our convertible subordinated notes but do not impact their
    carrying value. The fair market values of our convertible
    subordinated notes are determined based upon quoted secondary
    market prices on or before the dates specified were as follows
    (in millions):

December 31, 2007

December 31, 2008

    consolidated financial statements, none of the 4.5% Notes
    remained outstanding as of October 8, 2008. In addition,
    the volatility of the credit markets is likely to significantly
    impact our interest income related to our cash investments.

Currency Risk.

The business of our Canadian
    subsidiaries is subject to currency fluctuations. We do not
    expect any such currency risk to be material.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT

Management’s
    Report on Financial Information and Procedures

The accompanying financial statements of Quanta Services, Inc.
    and its subsidiaries were prepared by management. These
    financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States, applying
    certain estimates and judgments as required.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or
    detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
    well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
    absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives
    will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the
    fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
    controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further,
    because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
    evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
    misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all
    control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
    company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
    the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
    and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or
    mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual
    acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
    management override of the controls. The design of any system of
    controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the
    likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
    any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
    potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in
    the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control
    over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal
    control over financial reporting includes those policies and
    procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
    that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
    (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based upon the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2008 to provide reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation of financial statements for external reporting
    purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal
    control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
    assurances and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

The effectiveness of Quanta Services, Inc.’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008
    has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
    which appears herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Quanta Services,
    Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, of cash flows
    and of stockholders’ equity, present fairly, in all
    material respects, the financial position of Quanta Services,
    Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
    in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
    on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements, effective January 1, 2007, the
    Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes

.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

BUSINESS
    AND ORGANIZATION:

Quanta Services, Inc. (Quanta) is a leading national provider of
    specialized contracting services. Beginning January 1,
    2008, Quanta began reporting its results under two business
    segments. The infrastructure services (Infrastructure Services)
    segment provides specialized contracting services, offering
    end-to-end network solutions to the electric power, gas,
    telecommunications and cable television industries, including
    the design, installation, repair and maintenance of network
    infrastructure, as well as certain ancillary services.
    Additionally, the dark fiber (Dark Fiber) segment designs,
    procures, constructs and maintains

fiber-optic

telecommunications infrastructure in select markets and licenses
    the right to use

point-to-point

fiber-optic

telecommunications facilities to its customers.

On August 30, 2007, Quanta acquired, through a merger
    transaction (the Merger), all of the outstanding common stock of
    InfraSource Services, Inc. (InfraSource). For accounting
    purposes, the transaction was effective as of August 31,
    2007, and results of InfraSource’s operations have been
    included in the consolidated financial statements subsequent to
    August 31, 2007. Accordingly, the consolidated financial
    statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 only
    include results from InfraSource for four months. Similar to
    Quanta, InfraSource provided specialized infrastructure
    contracting services to the electric power, gas and
    telecommunications industries primarily in the United States.
    The acquisition enhanced and expanded Quanta’s capabilities
    in its existing service areas and added the Dark Fiber segment.

During 2007 and 2008, Quanta made six other acquisitions of
    businesses which have been reflected in Quanta’s
    consolidated financial statements as of their respective
    acquisition dates. These acquisitions allow Quanta to further
    expand its capabilities and scope of services in various
    locations around the United States.

On August 31, 2007, Quanta sold the operating assets
    associated with the business of Environmental Professional
    Associates, Limited (EPA), a Quanta subsidiary. Accordingly,
    Quanta has presented EPA’s results of operations for the
    2006 and 2007 periods as a discontinued operation in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

In the course of its operations, Quanta is subject to certain
    risk factors including, but not limited to, risks related to
    significant fluctuations in quarterly results; economic
    downturns, including the recent economic downturn and the
    financial and credit crisis; project delays or cancellations;
    internal growth and operating strategies; dependence on fixed
    price contracts; use of percentage-of-completion accounting;
    competition; impact of renewable energy initiatives, the Energy
    Policy Act of 2005 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment
    Act of 2009; replacement of canceled or completed contracts;

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Quanta include the
    accounts of Quanta and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
    significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
    eliminated in consolidation. Unless the context requires
    otherwise, references to Quanta include Quanta and its
    consolidated subsidiaries.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made in prior years’
    financial statements to conform to classifications used in the
    current year.

Use of
    Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management in
    determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist
    as of the date the financial statements are published and the
    reported amount of revenues and expenses recognized during the
    periods presented. Quanta reviews all significant estimates
    affecting its consolidated financial statements on a recurring
    basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior
    to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on
    Quanta’s beliefs and assumptions derived from information
    available at the time such judgments and estimates are made.
    Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are
    inherent in the preparation of financial statements. Estimates
    are primarily used in Quanta’s assessment of the allowance
    for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of
    assets, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill, other
    intangibles and long-lived asset impairments, purchase price
    allocations, self-insured claims liabilities, revenue
    recognition for construction contracts and dark fiber licensing,
    share-based compensation, provision for income taxes and
    calculation of uncertain tax positions.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Quanta had cash and cash equivalents of $407.1 million and
    $437.9 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2008. Cash
    consisting of interest-bearing demand deposits is carried at
    cost, which approximates fair value. Quanta considers all highly
    liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three
    months or less to be cash equivalents, which are carried at fair
    value. At December 31, 2008, cash equivalents were
    $399.1 million which consisted primarily of money market
    mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper. Cash
    equivalents falls within the scope of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements.” See the “Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments” disclosures below regarding cash equivalents
    that are within the scope of this standard. As of
    December 31, 2007 and 2008, cash held in domestic bank
    accounts was approximately $405.4 million and
    $433.7 million and cash held in foreign bank accounts was
    approximately $1.7 million and $4.2 million.

Short-Term
    Investments

Quanta held no short-term investments as of December 31,
    2007 or 2008; however, during 2006 and the first quarter of
    2007, Quanta invested from time to time in variable rate demand
    notes (VRDNs), which were classified as short-term investments,
    available for sale when held. The income from VRDNs was
    tax-exempt to Quanta.

Current
    and Long-Term Accounts and Notes Receivable and Allowance for
    Doubtful Accounts

Quanta provides an allowance for doubtful accounts when
    collection of an account or note receivable is considered
    doubtful, and receivables are written off against the allowance
    when deemed uncollectible. Inherent in the assessment of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and
    estimates including, among others, the customer’s access to
    capital, the customer’s willingness or ability to pay,
    general economic and market conditions and the ongoing
    relationship with the customer. Under certain circumstances such
    as



foreclosures or negotiated settlements, Quanta may take title to
    the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of
    receivables. Material changes in Quanta’s customers’
    business or cash flows, which may be further impacted by the
    current financial crisis and volatility of the markets, could
    affect its ability to collect amounts due from them. As of
    December 31, 2008, Quanta had total allowances for doubtful
    accounts of approximately $8.8 million. Should customers
    experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy, or
    should anticipated recoveries relating to receivables in
    existing bankruptcies or other workout situations fail to
    materialize, Quanta could experience reduced cash flows and
    losses in excess of current allowances provided.

The balances billed but not paid by customers pursuant to
    retainage provisions in certain contracts will be due upon
    completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer.
    Based on Quanta’s experience with similar contracts in
    recent years, the majority of the retainage balances at each
    balance sheet date will be collected within the subsequent
    fiscal year. Current retainage balances as of December 31,
    2007 and 2008 were approximately $60.2 million and
    $101.1 million and are included in accounts receivable.
    Retainage balances with settlement dates beyond the next twelve
    months are included in other assets, net and as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2008 were $2.1 million and
    $6.0 million.

Within accounts receivable, Quanta recognizes unbilled
    receivables in circumstances such as when: revenues have been
    earned and recorded but the amount cannot be billed under the
    terms of the contract until a later date; costs have been
    incurred but are yet to be billed under cost-reimbursement type
    contracts; or amounts arise from routine lags in billing (for
    example, work completed one month but not billed until the next
    month). These balances do not include revenues accrued for work
    performed under fixed-price contracts as these amounts are
    recorded as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings
    on uncompleted contracts. At December 31, 2007 and 2008,
    the balances of unbilled receivables included in accounts
    receivable were approximately $132.3 million and
    $122.9 million.

As of December 31, 2007, other assets, net included
    accounts and notes receivable due from a customer relating to
    the construction of independent power plants. During 2006, the
    underlying assets which had secured these notes receivable were
    sold pursuant to liquidation proceedings and the net proceeds
    were being held by a trustee. Quanta recorded allowances for a
    significant portion of these notes receivable in prior periods.
    As of December 31, 2007, the collection of amounts owed to
    Quanta were subject to further legal proceedings; however, in
    March 2008, the parties reached a settlement resulting in the
    payment of the net receivable amount and the release of any
    future claims against Quanta. The remaining note receivable
    balance was written off against the related allowance of
    approximately $43.0 million in March 2008, without any
    significant impact to Quanta’s results of operations for
    the year ended December 31, 2008.

Inventories

Inventories consist of parts and supplies held for use in the
    ordinary course of business and materials not yet installed and
    are valued by Quanta at the lower of cost or market as
    determined by using the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) or by specific identification methods.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is
    computed using the straight-line method, net of estimated
    salvage values, over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
    Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the
    lesser of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of
    the asset. Depreciation and amortization expense related to
    property and equipment was approximately $49.4 million,
    $55.9 million and $77.7 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
    when incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments,
    which extend the useful lives of existing equipment, are
    capitalized and depreciated over the adjusted remaining useful
    life of the assets. Upon retirement or disposition of property
    and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are
    removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is
    reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses.



Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment in
    accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount may not be realizable. If an evaluation is required, fair
    value would be determined by estimating the future undiscounted
    cash flows associated with the asset and comparing it to the
    asset’s carrying amount to determine if an impairment of
    such asset is necessary. The effect of any impairment would be
    to expense the difference between the fair value of such asset
    and its carrying value in the period incurred.

Capitalized
    Software

In accordance with Statement of Position (“SOP”)

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use”, we capitalize costs associated
    with internally developed

and/or

purchased software systems for new products and enhancements to
    existing products that have reached the application development
    stage and meet recoverability tests. Capitalized costs include
    external direct costs of materials and services utilized in
    developing or obtaining internal-use software, payroll and
    payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly
    associated with and devote time to the internal-use software
    project and interest costs incurred, if material, while
    developing internal-use software. Capitalization of such costs
    begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases
    no later than the point at which the project is substantially
    complete and ready for its intended purpose. Those capitalized
    costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the economic
    useful life of the asset, beginning when the asset is ready for
    its intended use. Capitalized costs are included in property and
    equipment on the consolidated balance sheets.

Other
    Assets, Net

Other assets, net consist primarily of debt issuance costs,
    non-current inventory, refundable security deposits for leased
    properties and insurance claims in excess of deductibles that
    are due from Quanta’s insurers.

Debt
    Issuance Costs

As of December 31, 2007 and 2008, capitalized debt issuance
    costs related to Quanta’s credit facility and convertible
    subordinated notes were included in other assets, net and are
    being amortized into interest expense on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the respective agreements giving rise to the
    debt issuance costs, which we believe approximated the effective
    tax rate method. As of December 31, 2007 and 2008,
    capitalized debt issuance costs were $15.8 million, with
    accumulated amortization of $9.3 million and
    $11.6 million. For the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2007 and 2008, amortization expense was $3.2 million,
    $2.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively.

Quanta incurred $4.0 million in debt issuance costs in the
    second quarter of 2006 related to its issuance of its 3.75%
    convertible subordinated notes (3.75% Notes). These costs
    were capitalized and are being amortized over seven years until
    April 30, 2013, the date of the note holders’ first
    put option. During the second quarter of 2006, Quanta also
    capitalized $2.0 million in connection with the amendment
    and restatement of its credit facility. Upon the amendment and
    restatement of Quanta’s credit facility in 2006, the
    obligations under the prior facility were terminated and related
    unamortized debt issuance costs in the amount of approximately
    $2.6 million were expensed in 2006 and included in interest
    expense. In addition, during the second quarter of 2006, Quanta
    repurchased a portion of its 4.0% convertible subordinated notes
    (4.0% Notes), and as a result, Quanta expensed
    $0.7 million in unamortized debt issuance costs as interest
    expense. In the third quarter of 2007, Quanta incurred
    $0.9 million in costs associated with certain amendments to
    the credit facility. These costs were capitalized and, along
    with costs incurred in connection with the amendment and
    restatement of the credit facility in the second quarter of
    2006, are being amortized until September 19, 2012, the
    amended maturity date.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangibles

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets,” goodwill is subject to an annual
    assessment for impairment using a two-step fair value-based test
    with the first step performed annually



at year-end, or more frequently if events or circumstances exist
    which indicate that goodwill may be impaired. For instance, a
    decrease in market capitalization below book value, significant
    change in business climate or loss of a significant customer,
    among other things, may trigger the need for interim impairment
    testing. The first step involves comparing the fair value of
    each of Quanta’s reporting units with its carrying value,
    including goodwill. Quanta determines fair value using a
    weighted combination of the discounted cash flow, market
    multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches with
    heavier weighting on the discounted cash flow method, as in
    management’s opinion, this method currently results in the
    most accurate calculation of a reporting unit’s fair value.
    Significant estimates used in the above methodologies include
    estimates of future cash flows, future short-term and long-term
    growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimates of
    market multiples for each of the reporting units. If the
    carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
    the second step is performed. The second step compares the
    carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the
    calculated fair value of the goodwill. If the calculated fair
    value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an
    impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction to goodwill
    with a corresponding charge to operating expense.
    SFAS No. 142 does not allow increases in the carrying
    value of reporting units that may result from Quanta’s
    impairment test, therefore Quanta may record goodwill
    impairments in the future, even when the aggregate fair value of
    Quanta’s reporting units and Quanta as a whole may increase.

Through December 31, 2008, Quanta’s management
    followed the guidance outlined in SFAS No. 141,
    “Business Combinations,” to identify the existence of
    identifiable intangible assets. Quanta’s intangible assets
    include customer relationships, backlog, non-compete agreements
    and patented rights and developed technology. The value of
    customer relationships is estimated using the

value-in-use

concept utilizing the income approach, specifically the excess
    earnings method. The excess earnings analysis consists of
    discounting to present value the projected cash flows
    attributable to the customer relationships, with consideration
    given to customer contract renewals, the importance or lack
    thereof of existing customer relationships to Quanta’s
    business plan, income taxes and required rates of return. Quanta
    values backlog based upon the contractual nature of the backlog
    within each service line, using the income approach to discount
    back to present value the cash flows attributable to the backlog.

Quanta amortizes intangible assets based upon the estimated
    consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset or
    on a straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits
    consumption cannot be reliably estimated. Intangible assets
    subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment in
    accordance with SFAS No. 144 and are tested for
    recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An
    impairment loss must be recognized if the carrying amount of an
    intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount
    exceeds its fair value.

Revenue
    Recognition

Infrastructure Services

— Quanta designs,
    installs and maintains networks for the electric power, gas,
    telecommunications and cable television industries, as well as
    provides various ancillary services to commercial, industrial
    and governmental entities. These services may be provided
    pursuant to master service agreements, repair and maintenance
    contracts and fixed price and non-fixed price installation
    contracts. Pricing under these contracts may be competitive unit
    price, cost-plus/hourly (or time and materials basis) or fixed
    price (or lump sum basis), and the final terms and prices of
    these contracts are frequently negotiated with the customer.
    Under unit-based contracts, the utilization of an output-based
    measurement is appropriate for revenue recognition. Under these
    contracts, Quanta recognizes revenue when units are completed
    based on pricing established between Quanta and the customer for
    each unit of delivery, which best reflects the pattern in which
    the obligation to the customer is fulfilled. Under
    cost-plus/hourly and time and materials type contracts, Quanta
    recognizes revenue on an input-basis, as labor hours are
    incurred and services are performed.

Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the
    percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of
    costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each
    contract. These contracts provide for a fixed amount of revenues
    for the entire project. Such contracts provide that the customer
    accept completion of progress to date and compensate Quanta for
    services rendered, measured in terms of units installed, hours
    expended or some other measure of progress. Contract costs
    include all direct material, labor



and subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to
    contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools,
    repairs and depreciation costs. Much of the materials associated
    with Quanta’s work are owner-furnished and are therefore
    not included in contract revenues and costs. The cost estimation
    process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of
    Quanta’s engineers, project managers and financial
    professionals. Changes in job performance, job conditions and
    final contract settlements are factors that influence
    management’s assessment of the total estimated costs to
    complete those contracts and therefore, Quanta’s profit
    recognition. Changes in these factors may result in revisions to
    costs and income, and their effects are recognized in the period
    in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for the total
    estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period
    in which such losses are determined to be probable and the
    amount can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2008,
    approximately $35.7 million had been included as contract
    price adjustments from change orders and/or claims on certain
    contracts which were in the process of being negotiated in the
    normal course of business.

Quanta may incur costs related to change orders, whether
    approved or unapproved by the customer,

and/or

claims related to certain contracts. Quanta determines the
    probability that such costs will be recovered based upon
    evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific
    discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer or
    verbal approvals. Quanta treats items as a cost of contract
    performance in the period incurred if it is not probable that
    the costs will be recovered or will recognize revenue if it is
    probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be
    reliably estimated.

The current asset “Costs and estimated earnings in excess
    of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents revenues
    recognized in excess of amounts billed for fixed price
    contracts. The current liability “Billings in excess of
    costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts”
    represents billings in excess of revenues recognized for fixed
    price contracts.

Dark Fiber

— Quanta has fiber-optic facility
    licensing agreements with various customers, pursuant to which
    it recognizes revenues, including any initial fees or advance
    billings, ratably over the expected length of the agreements,
    including probable renewal periods. As of December 31, 2007
    and December 31, 2008, initial fees and advanced billings
    on these licensing agreements not yet recorded in revenue were
    $23.2 million and $34.6 million and are recognized as
    deferred revenue, with $15.6 million and $25.1 million
    considered to be long-term and included in other non-current
    liabilities.

Dark
    Fiber Licensing

The Dark Fiber segment constructs and licenses the right to use
    fiber-optic telecommunications facilities to its customers
    pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with terms from five
    to twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal options.
    Under those agreements, customers are provided the right to use
    a portion of the capacity of a fiber-optic facility, with the
    facility owned and maintained by Quanta. Minimum future
    licensing revenues expected to be recognized by Quanta pursuant
    to these agreements at December 31, 2008 are as follows (in
    thousands):

Income
    Taxes

Quanta follows the liability method of accounting for income
    taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under this method,
    deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are
    measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected
    to be in effect when the underlying assets or liabilities are
    recovered or settled.

Quanta regularly evaluates valuation allowances established for
    deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain.
    The estimation of required valuation allowances includes
    estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of
    deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
    taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
    differences become deductible. Quanta considers projected future
    taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
    assessment. If actual future taxable income differs from these
    estimates, Quanta may not realize deferred tax assets to the
    extent estimated.

On January 1, 2007, Quanta adopted Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (FIN No. 48). FIN No. 48 prescribes a
    comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure,
    present and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax
    positions taken or to be taken on a tax return. Quanta records
    reserves for expected tax consequences of such uncertain
    positions assuming that the taxing authorities’ have full
    knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.

The income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and often
    ambiguous. As such, Quanta is required to make many subjective
    assumptions and judgments regarding its tax positions that could
    materially affect amounts recognized in its future consolidated
    balance sheets and statements of operations.

Collective
    Bargaining Agreements

Certain of Quanta’s subsidiaries are party to collective
    bargaining agreements with unions representing certain of their
    employees. The agreements require such subsidiaries to pay
    specified wages and provide certain benefits to their union
    employees. These agreements expire at various times and have
    typically been renegotiated and renewed on terms that are
    similar to the ones contained in the expiring agreements.

Under certain collective bargaining agreements, the applicable
    Quanta subsidiary is required to make contributions to
    multi-employer pension plans. Were the subsidiary to cease
    participation in one or more plans or the plans were to
    otherwise become underfunded, a liability could potentially be
    assessed related to any underfunding of these plans. The amount
    of any such assessment, were such an assessment to be made in
    the future, is not subject to reasonable estimation.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of accounts receivable, accounts payable and
    accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term
    nature of those instruments. SFAS No. 157 requires
    categorization of qualifying financial assets and liabilities
    into three broad levels based on the priority of the inputs used
    to determine the fair values. The fair value hierarchy gives the
    highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the
    lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). All of
    Quanta’s cash equivalents that are within the scope of
    SFAS No. 157 are categorized as Level 1 assets at
    December 31, 2008, as all values are based on unadjusted
    quoted prices for identical assets in an active market that
    Quanta has the ability to access.

Quanta’s convertible subordinated notes are not required to
    be carried at fair value, although their fair market value must
    be disclosed in accordance with SFAS No. 107,
    “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments.” The fair market value of Quanta’s
    convertible subordinated notes is subject to interest rate risk
    because of their fixed interest rates and market risk due to the
    convertible feature of the convertible subordinated notes.
    Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt
    will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest
    rates rise. The fair market value of Quanta’s convertible
    subordinated notes will also increase as the market price of our
    stock increases and decrease as the market price falls. The
    interest and



market value changes affect the fair market value of our
    convertible subordinated notes but do not impact their carrying
    value. The fair market values of Quanta’s convertible
    subordinated notes are determined based upon quoted secondary
    market prices on or before the dates specified and were as
    follows (in millions):

As a result of certain repurchases, redemptions and conversions,
    which are described in further detail in Note 8, none of
    the 4.5% convertible subordinated notes, remained outstanding as
    of October 8, 2008.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, Quanta adopted
    SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
    Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R)), using the modified
    prospective method of adoption, which requires recognition of
    compensation expense for all stock-based compensation beginning
    on the effective date. Under this method of accounting,
    compensation cost for stock-based compensation awards is based
    on the fair value of the awards granted, net of estimated
    forfeitures, at the date of grant. Quanta calculates the fair
    value of stock options using the Black-Sholes option pricing
    model. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined
    based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of
    Quanta’s common stock on the date of grant. Forfeitures are
    estimated based upon historical activity. The resulting
    compensation expense from discretionary awards is recognized on
    a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which
    is generally the vesting period, while compensation expense from
    performance based awards is recognized using the graded vesting
    method over the requisite service period.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires the cash flows resulting from
    the tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized
    during the applicable period to be classified as financing cash
    flows.

Functional
    Currency and Translation of Financial Statements

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the majority
    of Quanta’s operations. However, Quanta has foreign
    operating subsidiaries in Canada, for which Quanta considers the
    Canadian dollar to be the functional currency. Generally, the
    currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its
    transactions, including billings, financing, payroll and other
    expenditures would be considered the functional currency, but
    any dependency upon the parent company and the nature of the
    subsidiary’s operations must also be considered. In
    preparing the consolidated financial statements, Quanta
    translates the financial statements of the foreign operating
    subsidiaries from their functional currency into United States
    dollars. Statements of operations and cash flows are translated
    at average monthly rates, while balance sheets are translated at
    the month-end exchange rates. The translation of the balance
    sheets at the month-end exchange rates results in translation
    gains or losses. Under the relevant accounting guidance, the
    treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon
    management’s determination of the functional currency of
    each subsidiary, involving consideration of all relevant
    economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary. If
    transactions are denominated in the entity’s functional
    currency, the translation gains and losses are included as a
    separate component of stockholders’ equity under the
    caption “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” If
    transactions are not denominated in the entity’s functional
    currency, the translation gains and losses are included within
    the statement of operations.

Comprehensive
    Income

Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a
    period except those resulting from investments by and
    distributions to stockholders. As described above, Quanta
    records other comprehensive income for the foreign currency
    translation adjustment related to its foreign operations.



Derivatives

Quanta accounts for derivative transactions in accordance with
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivatives and
    Hedging Activities,” as amended by SFAS Nos. 137, 138
    and 149 and as interpreted by various Derivatives Implementation
    Group Issues. Quanta does not enter into derivative transactions
    for speculative purposes; however, for accounting purposes,
    certain transactions may not meet the criteria for hedge
    accounting. Accordingly, changes in fair value related to
    transactions that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting
    must be recorded in the consolidated results of operations. As
    of December 31, 2008, Quanta was not a party to any
    material derivative contracts.

Litigation
    Costs

Quanta records reserves when it is probable that a liability has
    been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably
    estimated. Costs incurred for litigation are expensed as
    incurred.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157.
    SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes methods
    used to measure fair value and expands disclosure requirements
    about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal periods, as it relates to financial assets
    and liabilities, as well as for any non-financial assets and
    liabilities that are carried at fair value.
    SFAS No. 157 also requires certain tabular disclosures
    related to the application of SFAS No. 144 and
    SFAS No. 142. On November 14, 2007, the FASB
    provided a one year deferral for the implementation of
    SFAS No. 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities.
    SFAS No. 157 excludes from its scope
    SFAS No. 123(R) and its related interpretive
    accounting pronouncements that address share-based payment
    transactions. Quanta adopted SFAS No. 157 on
    January 1, 2008 as it applies to its financial assets and
    liabilities, and based on the November 14, 2007 deferral of
    SFAS No. 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities,
    Quanta will begin following the guidance of
    SFAS No. 157 with respect to its non-financial assets
    and liabilities in the quarter ended March 31, 2009. At
    December 31, 2008, Quanta had no material financial assets
    and liabilities on its balance sheet carried at fair value other
    than certain cash and cash equivalents balances which are
    disclosed above as Level 1 assets, and therefore the
    partial adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a
    material impact on Quanta’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally,
    Quanta does not currently have any material non-financial assets
    or liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring
    basis; however, Quanta does have non-financial assets that are
    evaluated against measures of fair value on a non-recurring or
    as-needed basis, including goodwill, other intangibles and
    long-term assets held and used. Based on the financial and
    non-financial assets and liabilities on its balance sheet as of
    December 31, 2008, Quanta does not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on its
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP

FAS 157-3

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset Is Not Active.” FSP

FAS 157-3

provides clarifying guidance with respect to the application of
    SFAS No. 157 in determining the fair value of a
    financial asset when the market for that asset is not active.
    FSP

FAS 157-3

was effective upon its issuance. The application of FSP

FAS 157-3

did not have a material impact on Quanta’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of
    and for the year ended December 31, 2008 and is not
    expected to have a material impact on Quanta’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the
    near-term.

On January 1, 2008, Quanta adopted SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB No. 115.”
    SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure at
    fair value many financial instruments and certain other items
    that were not previously required to be measured at fair value.
    Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value
    option has been elected are reported in earnings.
    SFAS No. 159 does not affect any existing accounting
    literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be
    carried at fair value. The adoption of SFAS No. 159
    did not have a material impact on Quanta’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of
    and for the year ended December 31, 2008 and is not
    expected to have a material impact on Quanta’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the
    near-term.



On January 1, 2008, Quanta adopted EITF Issue

No. 06-11,

“Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
    Share-Based Payment Awards.”

EITF 06-11

requires that a realized income tax benefit from dividends or
    dividend equivalent units paid on unvested restricted shares and
    restricted share units be reflected as an increase in
    contributed surplus and as an addition to the company’s
    excess tax benefit pool, as defined under
    SFAS No. 123(R). Because Quanta did not declare any
    dividends during 2008 and does not currently anticipate
    declaring dividends in the near future, the adoption of

EITF 06-11

did not have any impact during the year ended December 31,
    2008, and is not expected to have a material impact in the near
    term, on Quanta’s consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51.”
    SFAS No. 160 addresses the accounting and reporting
    framework for minority interests by a parent company.
    SFAS No. 160 is to be effective for fiscal years, and
    interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008. Accordingly, Quanta adopted
    SFAS No. 160 on January 1, 2009, with no material
    impact to Quanta’s consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows on the date of adoption. As Quanta
    does not currently have any material subsidiaries with
    non-controlling interests, the adoption of
    SFAS No. 160 is not anticipated to have a material
    impact on its consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows in the near term.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141(R) is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, and accordingly, Quanta adopted SFAS No. 141(R)
    on January 1, 2009. Earlier application was prohibited, and
    assets and liabilities that arose from business combinations
    occurring prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R)
    cannot be adjusted upon the adoption of
    SFAS No. 141(R). SFAS No. 141(R) requires
    the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all
    (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the
    business combination; establishes the acquisition date as the
    measurement date to determine the fair value for all assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to
    disclose to investors and other users all of the information
    needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial
    effect of the business combination. As it relates to recognizing
    all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
    business combination, costs an acquirer expects but is not
    obligated to incur in the future to exit an activity of an
    acquiree or to terminate or relocate an acquiree’s
    employees are not liabilities at the acquisition date but must
    be expensed in accordance with other applicable generally
    accepted accounting principles. If the initial accounting for a
    business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting
    period in which the combination occurs, the acquirer must report
    in its financial statements provisional amounts for the items
    for which the accounting is incomplete. During the measurement
    period, which must not exceed one year from the acquisition
    date, the acquirer will retrospectively adjust the provisional
    amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new
    information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed
    as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected
    the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. The
    acquirer will be required to expense all acquisition-related
    costs in the periods such costs are incurred, other than costs
    to issue debt or equity securities in connection with the
    acquisition. SFAS No. 141(R) is not expected to have a
    material impact on Quanta’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows at the date of
    adoption, but Quanta expects that it may have a material impact
    on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows as a result of acquisitions in future periods.

In December 2007, the SEC published Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (SAB) No. 110 (SAB 110). SAB 110 expresses the
    views of the SEC staff regarding the use of a
    “simplified” method, as discussed in
    SAB No. 107 (SAB 107), in developing an estimate
    of the expected term of “plain vanilla” share options
    in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). In particular, the
    SEC staff indicated in SAB 107 that it will accept a
    company’s election to use the simplified method, regardless
    of whether the company has sufficient information to make more
    refined estimates of the expected term. However, the SEC staff
    stated in SAB 107 that it would not expect a company to use
    the simplified method for share option grants after
    December 31, 2007. In SAB 110, the SEC staff states
    that they would continue to accept, under certain circumstances,
    the use of the simplified method beyond December 31, 2007.
    Because Quanta did not issue any stock options in 2008,
    SAB 110 had no impact on Quanta’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2008.
    Furthermore, because Quanta currently does not anticipate
    issuing stock options in the near future, SAB 110 is not
    anticipated to



have a material impact on its consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows in the near term.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — An Amendment of FASB No. 133.”
    SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures to enable
    investors to better understand how a reporting entity’s
    derivative instruments and hedging activities impact the
    entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash
    flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial
    statements issued after November 15, 2008, including
    interim financial statements. Quanta adopted
    SFAS No. 161 on January 1, 2009, with no material
    impact on Quanta’s consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows on the date of adoption. As Quanta
    has not entered into any material derivatives or hedging
    activities and does not currently anticipate doing so, the
    adoption of SFAS No. 161 is not anticipated to have a
    material impact on Quanta’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

In April 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets.”

FSP 142-3

amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset under
    SFAS No. 142. The intent of

FSP 142-3

is to improve the consistency between the useful life of an
    intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to
    measure its fair value and to enhance existing disclosure
    requirements relating to intangible assets.

FSP 142-3

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008 and should be applied prospectively to intangible assets
    acquired after the effective date. Early adoption is prohibited.
    Accordingly, Quanta adopted

FSP 142-3

on January 1, 2009.

FSP 142-3

did not have an impact on Quanta’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows at the date of
    adoption, but Quanta expects it may have a material impact on
    its consolidated financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows in future periods.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.”
    SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting
    principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be
    used in the preparation of financial statements of
    non-governmental entities that are presented in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
    SFAS No. 162 will be effective 60 days following
    the SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, “The
    Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles.” Quanta will adopt
    SFAS No. 162 once it is effective, but has not yet
    determined the impact, if any, on its consolidated financial
    statements.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FSP APB

14-1,

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement).” FSP APB

14-1

requires issuers of such instruments to separately account for
    the liability and equity components in a manner that will
    reflect the entity’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate
    and interest cost. The value of the equity component is
    recognized with an offsetting discount to the face value of the
    debt, which will be amortized as non-cash interest expense over
    the expected life of the debt. This FSP is effective for
    financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal
    years, and is applied retrospectively to all periods presented.
    Accordingly, Quanta adopted FSP APB

14-1

on
    January 1, 2009 and will apply FSP APB

14-1

retrospectively to all periods presented by recording a
    cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle as of
    January 1

,

2007 for approximately $29.6 million and
    non-cash interest expense of approximately $17.8 million
    ($11.3 million after-tax) and $14.5 million
    ($9.2 million after-tax) for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2008. In addition, Quanta will record
    additional non-cash interest expense annually thereafter until
    Quanta’s 3.75% convertible subordinated notes are
    redeemable at the holders’ option in April 2013, with
    approximately $4.3 million ($2.7 million after-tax) in
    2009.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP

EITF 03-6-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions are Participating Securities.” FSP

EITF 03-6-1 states

that unvested share-based payment awards that contain
    non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
    (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities under the
    definition of SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per
    Share” and should be included in the computation of both
    basic and diluted earnings per share. FSP

EITF 03-6-1

is effective for



financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years.
    Accordingly, Quanta adopted FSP

EITF 03-6-1

on January 1, 2009. All prior period earnings per share
    data presented will be adjusted retrospectively to conform to
    the provisions of FSP

EITF 03-6-1.

Early application was not permitted. All of Quanta’s
    restricted stock grants have non-forfeitable rights to dividends
    and are considered participating securities under FSP

EITF 03-06-1.

Through December 31, 2008, any unvested restricted stock
    grants are accounted for under the treasury stock method. Under
    this method unvested restricted common shares were not included
    in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding
    and were included in the calculation of weighted average diluted
    shares outstanding to the extent the grant price was less than
    the average share price for the respective period. Beginning in
    the first quarter of 2009, under FSP

EITF 03-6-1,

we will retrospectively restate earnings per share data for all
    prior and future periods presented to include all participating
    unvested restricted common shares in the calculation of weighted
    average basic and dilutive shares outstanding. The impact of the
    retrospective application of FSP

EITF 03-6-1

on earnings per share is anticipated to be immaterial.

In June 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue

07-5,

“Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is
    Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock”

(EITF 07-5).

The primary objective of

EITF 07-5

is to provide guidance for determining whether an equity-linked
    financial instrument or embedded feature within a contract is
    indexed to an entity’s own stock, which is a key criterion
    of the scope exception to paragraph 11 (a) of
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities.” This criterion is also
    important in evaluating whether

EITF 00-19,

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
    to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock”
    applies to certain financial instruments that are not
    derivatives under SFAS No. 133. An equity-linked
    financial instrument or embedded feature within a contract that
    is not considered indexed to an entity’s own stock could be
    required to be classified as an asset or liability and
    marked-to-market through earnings.

EITF 07-5

specifies a two-step approach in evaluating whether an
    equity-linked financial instrument or embedded feature within a
    contract is indexed to its own stock. The first step involves
    evaluating the instrument’s contingent exercise provisions,
    if any, and the second step involves evaluating the
    instrument’s settlement provisions.

EITF 07-5

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, and must be applied to
    all instruments outstanding as of the effective date.
    Accordingly, Quanta adopted

EITF 07-5

on January 1, 2009, with no material impact to
    Quanta’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows on the date of adoption. Quanta also
    does not anticipate the adoption of

EITF 07-5

to have a material impact on its future consolidated financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows.

In November 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue

08-6,

“Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations”

(EITF 08-06).

EITF 08-6

requires that the initial measurement of an equity method
    investment be at cost in accordance with
    SFAS No. 141(R). It also requires that an equity
    method investor recognize other-than-temporary impairments of an
    equity method investment in accordance with paragraph 19(h)
    of APB Opinion 18. Additionally, an equity method investor shall
    not separately test an investee’s underlying
    indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, and an equity
    method investor shall account for a share issuance by an
    investee as if the investor had sold a proportionate share of
    its investment. Any gain or loss to the investor resulting from
    an investee’s share issuance shall be recognized in
    earnings, subject to certain exceptions.

EITF 08-6

is effective on a prospective basis in fiscal years beginning on
    or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within
    those fiscal years. Accordingly, Quanta adopted

EITF 08-6

on January 1, 2009, with no material impact to
    Quanta’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows on the date of adoption. Quanta does
    not anticipate the adoption of

EITF 08-6

to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows in the near term.

In November 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue

08-7,

“Accounting for Defensible Intangible Assets.”

EITF 08-7

requires that a defensible intangible asset should be accounted
    for as a separate unit of account rather than as part of the
    cost of an acquirer’s existing intangible assets and that
    the useful life assigned to such defensible intangible asset
    should reflect the entity’s consumption of the expected
    benefits related to the asset.

EITF 08-7

is effective on a prospective basis in fiscal years beginning on
    or after December 15, 2008. Accordingly, Quanta adopted

EITF 08-7

on January 1, 2009, with no impact on its consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows at the
    date of adoption. Quanta anticipates that the adoption of



EITF 08-7

may have a material impact on its consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows in the future when
    it is applied to acquisitions which occur in future periods.

In November 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue

08-8,

“Accounting for an Instrument (or an Embedded Feature) with
    a Settlement Amount That is Based on the Stock of an
    Entity’s Consolidated Subsidiary.”

EITF 08-8

provides guidance regarding the accounting for a financial
    instrument or embedded feature when it is indexed to a
    subsidiary considered to be a substantive entity in that such
    instrument or feature is not precluded from being considered
    indexed to the entity’s own stock in the consolidated
    financial statements of the parent. Additionally, an
    equity-classified instrument or feature within the scope of

EITF 08-8

shall be presented as a component of noncontrolling interest in
    the consolidated financial statements, whether the instrument
    was entered into by the parent or subsidiary.

EITF 08-8

is effective in fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008. Accordingly, Quanta adopted

EITF 08-8

on January 1, 2009, with no impact to its consolidated
    financial position on the date of adoption because it had no
    such instruments or embedded features at December 31, 2008.
    Quanta also does not expect the adoption of

EITF 08-8

to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows in the near term.

ACQUISITIONS:

    Acquisitions

In April 2008, Quanta acquired a telecommunication and cable
    construction company for a purchase price of approximately
    $38.6 million, consisting of approximately
    $24.6 million in cash and 593,470 shares of Quanta
    common stock valued at approximately $14.0 million at the
    date of acquisition on a discounted basis as a result of the
    restricted nature of the shares. The acquisition allows Quanta
    to further expand its telecommunications and cable capabilities
    in the southwestern United States. The estimated fair value of
    the tangible assets was $20.9 million and consisted of
    current assets of $14.2 million, property and equipment of
    $6.6 million and other non-current assets of
    $0.1 million. Net tangible assets acquired were
    $14.4 million after considering the assumed liabilities of
    $6.5 million. The excess of the purchase price over net
    tangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill in the amount
    of $18.3 million and intangible assets in the amount of
    $5.9 million, consisting of customer relationships, backlog
    and a non-compete agreement. This allocation is based on the
    significant use of estimates and on information that was
    available to management at the time these condensed consolidated
    financial statements were prepared.

In July 2008, Quanta acquired a helicopter-assisted transmission
    line installation, maintenance and repair services company for a
    purchase price of approximately $6.1 million, consisting of
    approximately $3.8 million in cash and 82,862 shares
    of Quanta common stock valued at approximately $2.3 million
    at the date of acquisition on a discounted basis as a result of
    the restricted nature of the shares. The acquisition allows
    Quanta to augment its existing transmission resources and better
    positions Quanta to meet the evolving needs of its customers,
    especially in environmentally sensitive areas. The estimated
    fair value of the tangible assets acquired was
    $3.6 million, consisting of current assets of
    $0.7 million and property and equipment of
    $2.9 million. Net tangible assets acquired were
    $3.5 million after considering the assumed liabilities of
    $0.1 million. The excess of the purchase price over net
    tangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill in the amount
    of $2.0 million and intangible assets in the amount of
    $0.6 million, consisting of non-compete agreements. This
    allocation is based on the significant use of estimates and on
    information that was available to management at the time these
    condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared.

In November 2008, Quanta acquired two affiliated professional
    telecommunications engineering companies for a purchase price of
    approximately $9.4 million, consisting of approximately
    $6.2 million in cash and 281,896 shares of Quanta
    common stock valued at approximately $3.2 million at the
    date of acquisition on a discounted basis as a result of the
    restricted nature of the shares. The acquisition allows Quanta
    to further enhance its telecommunications and cable services in
    the southeast region of the United States. The estimated fair
    value of the tangible assets acquired was $2.7 million,
    consisting of current assets of $2.2 million and property
    and equipment of $0.5 million. Net tangible assets acquired
    were $1.8 million after considering the assumed liabilities
    of $0.9 million. The excess of the purchase price over net
    tangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill in the amount
    of $4.3 million and intangible assets in the amount of
    $3.3 million,



consisting of customer relationships, backlog and non-compete
    agreements. This allocation is based on the significant use of
    estimates and on information that was available to management at
    the time these condensed consolidated financial statements were
    prepared.

InfraSource
    Acquisition

On August 30, 2007, Quanta acquired through the Merger all
    of the outstanding common stock of InfraSource. In connection
    with the acquisition, Quanta issued to InfraSource’s
    stockholders 1.223 shares of Quanta common stock for each
    outstanding share of InfraSource common stock, resulting in the
    issuance of a total of 49,975,553 shares of common stock
    for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
    $1.3 billion. Quanta funded the repayment of approximately
    $60.5 million of InfraSource’s outstanding borrowings
    under its credit agreement through Quanta’s available cash
    and cash on hand at InfraSource at the time of closing.

The following summarizes the allocation of the purchase price
    and estimated transaction costs related to the InfraSource
    acquisition. This allocation is based on the significant use of
    estimates and on information that was available to management at
    the time these condensed consolidated financial statements were
    prepared.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values (in
    thousands):

Additionally, Quanta incurred approximately $12.1 million
    of costs related to the Merger which have been included in
    goodwill but are not in the above purchase price allocation.

The amounts assigned to various intangible assets at
    August 31, 2007 related to the InfraSource acquisition are
    customer relationships of $95.3 million, backlog of
    $50.5 million and non-compete agreements of
    $13.0 million. The customer relationships are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over 15.0 years, backlog
    is being amortized based on the estimated pattern of the
    consumption of the economic benefit over an original weighted
    average period of 1.3 years and the non-compete agreements
    are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of
    the underlying contracts over the original weighted average
    period of 2.0 years.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
    fair value of the acquired net assets. Quanta has and continues
    to anticipate it will realize meaningful operational and cost
    synergies, such as the  elimination of duplicate corporate
    functions, enhancement of the combined service offerings,
    expansion of the geographic reach and resource base of the
    combined company, improvement in the utilization of personnel
    and fixed assets, as well as acceleration of revenue growth
    through enhanced cross-selling and marketing opportunities.
    Quanta believes these opportunities contribute to the
    recognition of the substantial goodwill.

The following unaudited supplemental pro forma results of
    operations have been provided for illustrative purposes only and
    do not purport to be indicative of the actual results that would
    have been achieved by the combined company for the periods
    presented or that may be achieved by the combined company in the
    future. Future results may vary significantly from the results
    reflected in the following pro forma financial information



because of future events and transactions, as well as other
    factors. The following pro forma results of operations have been
    provided for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 as

The pro forma combined results of operations have been prepared
    by adjusting the historical results of Quanta to include the
    historical results of InfraSource, the reduction in interest
    expense and interest income as a result of the repayment of
    InfraSource’s outstanding indebtedness on the acquisition
    date and certain reclassifications to conform InfraSource’s
    presentation to Quanta’s accounting policies. The pro forma
    results of operations do not include any cost savings that may
    result from the Merger or any estimated costs that have been or
    will be incurred by Quanta to integrate the businesses other
    than those incurred in 2007 subsequent to the acquisition. As
    noted above, the pro forma results of operations do not purport
    to be indicative of the actual results that would have been
    achieved by the combined company for the periods presented or
    that may be achieved by the combined company in the future. For
    example, Quanta recorded tax benefits in the first and third
    quarters of 2007 of $15.3 million and $17.9 million
    primarily due to a decrease in reserves for uncertain tax
    positions resulting from the settlement of a multi-year IRS
    audit. Additionally, InfraSource incurred $13.4 million in
    merger-related costs prior to the Merger that have not been
    eliminated in the 2007 pro forma results of operations above.
    Items such as these, coupled with other risk factors that could
    have affected the combined company and its operations, make it
    difficult to use the pro forma results of operations to project
    future results of operations.

Quanta completed three other acquisitions during the year ended
    December 31, 2007 and three acquisitions during the year
    ended December 31, 2008. The pro forma impact of these
    other acquisitions has not been included due to the fact that
    they are immaterial to Quanta’s financial statements
    individually and in the aggregate.

Other
    2007 Acquisitions

In January 2007, Quanta acquired a foundation drilling company
    for a purchase price of $32.3 million, consisting of
    $20.4 million in cash and 693,784 shares of Quanta
    common stock valued at $11.9 million at the date of
    acquisition on a discounted basis as a result of the restricted
    nature of the shares. The acquisition allows Quanta to have
    in-house capabilities to construct drilled pier foundations for
    electric transmission towers and wireless telecommunication
    towers. The estimated fair value of the tangible assets was
    $11.3 million and consisted of current assets of
    $7.3 million and property and equipment of
    $4.0 million. Net tangible assets acquired were
    $5.4 million after considering liabilities of
    $5.9 million. The excess of the purchase price over net
    tangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill in the amount
    of $20.7 million and intangible assets in the amount of
    $6.2 million, consisting of customer relationships, backlog
    and a non-compete agreement.

In May 2007, Quanta acquired a telecommunications company for a
    purchase price of $4.5 million, consisting of
    $3.0 million in cash and 54,560 shares of Quanta
    common stock valued at $1.5 million at the date of
    acquisition on a discounted basis as a result of the restricted
    nature of the shares. The acquisition allows Quanta to further
    expand its telecommunications business in the western United
    States. The estimated



fair value of the tangible assets was $1.8 million and
    consisted of current assets of $1.5 million and property
    and equipment of $0.3 million. Net tangible assets acquired
    were $1.5 million after considering liabilities of
    $0.3 million. The excess of the purchase price over net
    tangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill in the amount
    of $1.4 million and intangible assets in the amount of
    $1.6 million, consisting of customer relationships, backlog
    and a non-compete agreement.

    for a purchase price of $24.6 million, consisting of
    $15.6 million in cash and 337,108 shares of Quanta
    common stock valued at $9.0 million at the date of
    acquisition on a discounted basis as a result of the restricted
    nature of the shares. The acquisition allows Quanta to further
    expand its foundation drilling business in connection with the
    construction of electric transmission infrastructure in the
    United States. The estimated fair value of the tangible assets
    was $9.6 million and consisted of current assets of
    $4.6 million and property and equipment of
    $5.0 million. Net tangible assets acquired were
    $8.5 million after considering liabilities of
    $1.1 million. The excess of the purchase price over net

During 2006, as part of our annual test for goodwill impairment,
    goodwill of $56.8 million was written off as a non-cash
    operating expense. The goodwill impairment is associated with a
    decrease in the expected future demand for the services of one
    of our businesses, which has historically served the cable
    television industry.

During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, Quanta
    recorded approximately $170.0 million and $9.7 million
    in other intangible assets associated with acquisitions.
    Additionally, in May 2008, Quanta acquired the rights to certain
    developed technology, along with pending and issued patent
    protections to this technology, for approximately
    $14.6 million. This developed technology will enhance
    Quanta’s energized services capabilities and is being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated economic
    life of approximately 13 years. The acquired technology is
    included in patented rights and developed technology in the
    below table.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATION:

On August 31, 2007, Quanta sold the operating assets
    associated with the business of EPA, a Quanta subsidiary, for
    approximately $6.0 million in cash. Quanta has presented
    EPA’s results of operations for the 2006 and 2007 periods
    as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations. Quanta does not allocate corporate
    debt or interest expense to discontinued operations. As a result
    of the sale, a pre-tax gain of approximately $3.7 million
    was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2007 and
    included as income from discontinued operation in the
    consolidated statement of operations in such period.

The amounts of revenues and pre-tax income (including the
    pre-tax gain of $3.7 million in the year ended
    December 31, 2007) related to EPA and included in
    income from discontinued operation are as follows (in thousands):

PER SHARE
    INFORMATION:

Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average
    number of common shares outstanding during the period, and
    diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period
    adjusted for all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents,
    except in cases where the effect of the common stock equivalent
    would be antidilutive. The amounts used to compute the basic and
    diluted earnings per share for the years ended 2006, 2007 and
    2008 are illustrated below (in thousands):

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, stock
    options and restricted stock of approximately 0.2 million,
    0.5 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, were
    excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share
    because the grant prices of these common stock equivalents were
    greater than the average market price of Quanta’s common
    stock. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the effect of
    assuming conversion of Quanta’s convertible subordinated
    notes would be antidilutive, and accordingly were excluded from
    the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

Credit
    Facility

Quanta has a credit facility with various lenders that provides
    for a $475.0 million senior secured revolving credit
    facility maturing on September 19, 2012. Subject to the
    conditions specified in the credit facility, borrowings under
    the credit facility are to be used for working capital, capital
    expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The entire
    unused portion of the credit facility is available for the
    issuance of letters of credit.

As of December 31, 2008, Quanta had approximately
    $160.2 million of letters of credit issued under the credit
    facility and no outstanding revolving loans. The remaining
    $314.8 million was available for revolving loans or issuing
    new letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the credit
    facility bear interest, at Quanta’s option, at a rate equal
    to either (a) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the credit
    facility) plus 0.875% to 1.75%, as determined by the ratio of
    Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as
    defined in the credit facility), or (b) the base rate (as
    described below) plus 0.00% to 0.75%, as determined by the ratio
    of Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA.
    Letters of credit issued under the credit facility are subject
    to a letter of credit fee of 0.875% to 1.75%, based on the ratio
    of Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA.
    Quanta is also subject to a commitment fee of 0.15% to 0.35%,
    based on the ratio of its total funded debt to consolidated
    EBITDA, on any unused availability under the credit facility.
    The base rate equals the higher of (i) the Federal Funds
    Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus


/


of 1% or (ii) the bank’s prime rate.

The credit facility contains certain covenants, including
    covenants with respect to maximum funded debt to consolidated
    EBITDA, maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA and minimum
    interest coverage, in each case as specified in the credit
    facility. For purposes of calculating the maximum funded debt to



consolidated EBITDA ratio and the maximum senior debt to
    consolidated EBITDA ratio, Quanta’s maximum funded debt and
    maximum senior debt are reduced by all cash and cash equivalents
    (as defined in the credit facility) held by Quanta in excess of
    $25.0 million. As of December 31, 2008, Quanta was in
    compliance with all of its covenants. The credit facility limits
    certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, capital
    expenditures, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and,
    subject to certain exceptions, prohibits liens on material
    assets. The credit facility also limits the payment of dividends
    and stock repurchase programs in any fiscal year except those
    payments or other distributions payable solely in capital stock.
    The credit facility provides for customary events of default and
    carries cross-default provisions with all of Quanta’s
    existing subordinated notes, its continuing indemnity and
    security agreement with its sureties and all of its other debt
    instruments exceeding $15.0 million in borrowings. If an
    event of default (as defined in the credit facility) occurs and
    is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
    forth in the credit facility, amounts outstanding under the
    credit facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared
    immediately due and payable.

The credit facility is secured by a pledge of all of the capital
    stock of Quanta’s U.S. subsidiaries, 65% of the
    capital stock of its foreign subsidiaries and substantially all
    of its assets are pledged related to the credit facility.
    Quanta’s U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the repayment of
    all amounts due under the credit facility. Quanta’s
    obligations under the credit facility constitute designated
    senior indebtedness under its 3.75% Notes.

4.0% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

During the first half of 2007, Quanta had outstanding
    $33.3 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0%
    convertible subordinated notes (4.0% Notes), which matured
    on July 1, 2007. The outstanding principal balance of the
    4.0% Notes plus accrued interest were repaid on
    July 2, 2007, the first business day after the maturity
    date.

4.5% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

At December 31, 2008, none of Quanta’s 4.5%
    convertible subordinated notes due 2023 (4.5% Notes) were
    outstanding. The 4.5% Notes were originally issued in
    October 2003 for an aggregate principal amount of
    $270.0 million and required semi-annual interest payments
    on April 1 and October 1 until maturity. The resale of the
    4.5% Notes and the shares issuable upon their conversion
    was registered for the benefit of the holders on a shelf
    registration statement filed with the SEC.

The indenture under which the 4.5% Notes were issued
    provided the holders of the notes the right to require Quanta to
    repurchase in cash, on October 1, 2008, all or some of
    their notes at the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
    unpaid interest. As a result of this repurchase right, Quanta
    reclassified approximately $270.0 million outstanding
    aggregate principal amount of the 4.5% Notes as a current
    obligation in October 2007.

The indenture also provided that, beginning October 8,
    2008, Quanta had the right to redeem for cash some or all of the
    4.5% Notes at the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
    unpaid interest. On August 27, 2008, Quanta notified the
    registered holders of the 4.5% Notes that it would redeem
    the notes on October 8, 2008. Upon notification of the
    redemption and until October 6, 2008, the holders of the
    4.5% Notes had the right to convert all or a portion of the
    principal amount of their notes to shares of Quanta’s
    common stock at a conversion rate of 89.7989 shares of
    common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of notes
    converted, which equates to a conversion price of $11.14 per
    share.

During 2008, the holders of $269.8 million aggregate
    principal amount of the 4.5% Notes elected to convert their
    notes, resulting in the issuance of 24,229,781 shares of
    Quanta’s common stock, substantially all of which followed
    the redemption notice. Quanta also repurchased $106,000
    aggregate principal amount of the 4.5% Notes on
    October 1, 2008 pursuant to the holders’ election and
    redeemed for cash $49,000 aggregate principal amount of the
    notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on October 8,
    2008. As a result of all of these transactions, none of the
    4.5% Notes remained outstanding as of October 8, 2008.



3.75% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

At December 31, 2008, Quanta had outstanding
    $143.8 million aggregate principal amount of
    3.75% Notes. The resale of the notes and the shares
    issuable upon conversion thereof was registered for the benefit
    of the holders on a shelf registration statement filed with the
    SEC. The 3.75% Notes mature on April 30, 2026 and bear
    interest at the annual rate of 3.75%, payable semi-annually on
    April 30 and October 30, until maturity.

The 3.75% Notes are convertible into Quanta’s common
    stock, based on an initial conversion rate of
    44.6229 shares of Quanta’s common stock per $1,000
    principal amount of 3.75% Notes (which is equal to an
    initial conversion price of approximately $22.41 per share),
    subject to adjustment as a result of certain events. The
    3.75% Notes are convertible by the holder (i) during
    any fiscal quarter if the closing price of Quanta’s common
    stock is greater than 130% of the conversion price for at least
    20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days
    ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
    fiscal quarter, (ii) upon Quanta calling the
    3.75% Notes for redemption, (iii) upon the occurrence
    of specified distributions to holders of Quanta’s common
    stock or specified corporate transactions or (iv) at any
    time on or after March 1, 2026 until the business day
    immediately preceding the maturity date of the 3.75% Notes.
    The 3.75% Notes are not presently convertible, although
    they have been convertible in certain prior quarters as a result
    of the satisfaction of the market price condition described in
    clause (i) above. If the 3.75% Notes become
    convertible under any of these circumstances, Quanta has the
    option to deliver cash, shares of Quanta’s common stock or
    a combination thereof, with the amount of cash determined in
    accordance with the terms of the indenture under which the notes
    were issued. Conversions that may occur in the future could
    result in the recording of losses on extinguishment of debt if
    the conversions are settled in cash for an amount in excess of
    the principal amount. The holders of the 3.75% Notes who
    convert their notes in connection with certain change in control
    transactions, as defined in the indenture, may be entitled to a
    make whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion
    rate. In the event of a change in control, in lieu of paying
    holders a make whole premium, if applicable, Quanta may elect,
    in some circumstances, to adjust the conversion rate and related
    conversion obligations so that the 3.75% Notes are
    convertible into shares of the acquiring or surviving company.

Beginning on April 30, 2010 until April 30, 2013,
    Quanta may redeem for cash all or part of the 3.75% Notes
    at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
    and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Quanta’s
    common stock is equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion
    price then in effect for the 3.75% Notes for at least 20
    trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on
    the trading day immediately prior to the date of mailing of the
    notice of redemption. In addition, Quanta may redeem for cash
    all or part of the 3.75% Notes at any time on or after
    April 30, 2010 at certain redemption prices, plus accrued
    and unpaid interest. Beginning with the six-month interest
    period commencing on April 30, 2010, and for each six-month
    interest period thereafter, Quanta will be required to pay
    contingent interest on any outstanding 3.75% Notes during
    the applicable interest period if the average trading price of
    the 3.75% Notes reaches a specified threshold. The
    contingent interest payable within any applicable interest
    period will equal an annual rate of 0.25% of the average trading
    price of the 3.75% Notes during a five trading day
    reference period.

The holders of the 3.75% Notes may require Quanta to
    repurchase all or a part of the notes in cash on each of
    April 30, 2013, April 30, 2016 and April 30,
    2021, and in the event of a change in control of Quanta, as
    defined in the indenture, at a purchase price equal to 100% of
    the principal amount of the 3.75% Notes plus accrued and
    unpaid interest. The 3.75% Notes carry cross-default
    provisions with Quanta’s other debt instruments exceeding
    $20.0 million in borrowings, which includes Quanta’s
    existing credit facility.

The current deferred income tax assets, net of current deferred
    income tax liabilities, are included in prepaid expenses and
    other current assets.

At December 31, 2008, Quanta had state net operating loss
    carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately
    $10.5 million. These carryforwards will expire as follows:
    2009, $0.3 million; 2010, $0.3 million; 2011,
    $0.3 million; 2012, $0.2 million; 2013,
    $0.4 million and $9.0 million thereafter.

In assessing the value of deferred tax assets, Quanta considers
    whether it was more likely than not that some or all of the
    deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate
    realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
    generation of future taxable income during the periods in which
    those temporary differences become deductible. Quanta considers
    the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected
    future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
    assessment. Based upon these considerations,



Quanta provides a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying
    value of certain of its deferred tax assets to their net
    expected realizable value.

Quanta has not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or
    foreign withholding taxes for undistributed earnings of its

non-U.S. subsidiaries

as of December 31, 2008, as Quanta intends to reinvest
    these earnings indefinitely. It is not practicable to determine
    the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax
    liability.

As discussed in Note 2, Quanta adopted FIN No. 48
    on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of
    FIN No. 48, Quanta recognized a $1.5 million decrease
    in the reserve for uncertain tax positions, which was accounted
    for as an adjustment to accumulated deficit as of
    January 1, 2007. A reconciliation of the beginning and
    ending balances of unrecognized tax liabilities is as follows
    (in thousands):

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the
    $11.7 million in settlements relates to the completion of
    IRS audits for tax years 2000 to 2004 and the $22.7 million
    reduction is due to the lapse in certain statutes of limitations
    for tax years 2000 to 2003. For the year ended December 31,
    2008, the $1.2 million in settlements relates to the
    completion of a state tax audit for tax years 1998 to 2001 and
    the $0.9 million reduction is due to the lapse in certain
    statutes of limitations for tax years 2001 to 2004.

The balances of unrecognized tax benefits, the amount of related
    interest and penalties and what Quanta believes to be the range
    of reasonably possible changes in the next 12 months are as
    follows:

Quanta classifies interest and penalties within the provision
    for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2008,
    $4.8 million of tax expense related to interest and
    penalties was recognized in the statement of operations,
    compared with $6.5 million tax benefit for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

Quanta is subject to income tax in the United States, multiple
    state jurisdictions and a few foreign jurisdictions. Quanta
    remains open to examination by the IRS for tax years 2005
    through 2007 as these statutes of limitations have not yet
    expired. Quanta does not consider any state in which it does
    business to be a major tax jurisdiction under
    FIN No. 48.



10.

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY:

Stockholder
    Rights Plan

Quanta has a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which one right
    to acquire Series D Junior Preferred Stock, as summarized
    below, has been issued and attached to each outstanding share of
    common stock. Until a distribution date occurs, the rights can
    be transferred only with the common stock. On the occurrence of
    a distribution date, the rights will separate from the common
    stock and become exercisable as described below.

A “distribution date” will occur upon the earlier of:

•

the tenth day after a public announcement that a person or group
    of affiliated or associated persons other than Quanta and
    certain exempt persons (an “acquiring person”) has
    acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the total voting
    rights of the then outstanding shares of Quanta’s common
    stock; or

•

the tenth business day following the commencement of a tender or
    exchange offer that would result in such person or group
    becoming an acquiring person.

Following the distribution date, holders of rights will be
    entitled to purchase from Quanta one one-thousandth (1/1000th)
    of a share of Series D Junior Preferred Stock at a purchase
    price of $153.33, subject to adjustment.

In the event that any person or group becomes an acquiring
    person, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a
    right, other than rights beneficially owned by the acquiring
    person, will thereafter have the right to receive upon payment
    of the purchase price, that number of shares of common stock
    having a market value equal to the result obtained by
    (A) multiplying the then current purchase price by the
    number of one one-thousandths of a share of Series D Junior
    Preferred Stock for which the right is then exercisable, and
    dividing that product by (B) 50% of the current per share
    market price of our shares of common stock on the date of such
    occurrence. If, following the date of a public announcement that
    an acquiring person has become such, (1) Quanta is acquired
    in a merger or other business combination transaction and Quanta
    is not the surviving corporation, (2) any person
    consolidates or merges with Quanta and all or part of the common
    stock is converted or exchanged for securities, cash or property
    of any other person, or (3) 50% or more of Quanta’s
    assets or earning power is sold or transferred, then the rights
    will “flip-over.” At that time, each right will
    entitle its holder to purchase, for the purchase price, a number
    of shares of common stock of the surviving entity in any such
    merger, consolidation or other business combination or the
    purchaser in any such sale or transfer with a market value equal
    to the result obtained by (X) multiplying the then current
    purchase price by the number of one one-thousandths of a share
    of Series D Junior Preferred Stock for which the right is
    then exercisable, and dividing that product by (Y) 50% of
    the current per share market price of the shares of common stock
    of the surviving entity on the date of consummation of such
    consolidation, merger, sale or transfer.

The rights will expire on March 8, 2010, unless Quanta
    terminates them before that time. A holder of a right will not
    have any rights as a stockholder of Quanta, including the right
    to vote or to receive dividends, until a right is exercised.

Limited
    Vote Common Stock

The shares of Limited Vote Common Stock have rights similar to
    shares of common stock, except that such shares are entitled to
    elect one member of the Board of Directors and are entitled to
    one-tenth of one vote for each share held on all other matters.
    Each share of Limited Vote Common Stock will convert into common
    stock upon disposition by the holder of such shares in
    accordance with the transfer restrictions applicable to such
    shares. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and
    2008, 95,975 shares, 155,634 shares and
    11,790 shares, respectively, of Limited Vote Common Stock
    were converted to common stock. In addition, in 2008, Quanta
    issued an aggregate 90,394 shares of its common stock in
    exchange for an aggregate 86,088 shares of Limited Vote
    Common Stock.



Treasury
    Stock

Pursuant to the stock incentive plans described in Note 11,
    employees may elect to satisfy their tax withholding obligations
    upon vesting of restricted stock by having Quanta make such tax
    payments and withhold a number of vested shares having a value
    on the date of vesting equal to their tax withholding
    obligation. As a result of such employee elections, Quanta
    withheld 368,179 shares of Quanta common stock in 2006 with
    a total market value of $5.1 million, 213,403 shares
    of Quanta common stock in 2007 with a total market value of
    $5.1 million and 188,714 shares of Quanta common stock
    in 2008 with a total market value of $4.5 million for
    settlement of employee tax liabilities. These shares were
    accounted for as treasury stock. Under Delaware corporate law,
    treasury stock is not entitled to vote or be counted for quorum
    purposes.

Deferred
    Compensation

Pursuant to the Quanta Plans discussed in Note 11, Quanta
    issues restricted stock at the fair market value of the common
    stock as of the date of issuance. The shares of restricted stock
    issued pursuant to the Quanta Plans are subject to forfeiture,
    restrictions on transfer and certain other conditions until they
    vest, which generally occurs over three years in equal annual
    installments. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), upon
    issuance of the restricted stock, an unamortized compensation
    expense equivalent to the market value of the shares on the date
    of grant was charged to stockholders’ equity and amortized
    over the vesting period as non-cash compensation expense,
    typically three years. If shares of restricted stock were
    canceled during a given period, any remaining unamortized
    deferred compensation expense related to the issuance and any
    non-cash compensation expense previously recognized on the
    canceled shares were reversed against additional paid-in
    capital. In connection with the adoption of SFAS 123(R),
    deferred compensation is no longer recorded and the amount
    recorded as of December 31, 2005, $6.4 million, was
    reversed against additional paid-in capital in 2006.

LONG-TERM
    INCENTIVE PLANS:

Stock
    Incentive Plan

Pursuant to the Quanta Services, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan
    (the 2007 Plan), which was adopted on May 24, 2007, Quanta
    may award restricted common stock, incentive stock options and
    non-qualified stock options. The purpose of the 2007 Plan is to
    provide directors, key employees, officers and certain
    consultants and advisors with additional performance incentives
    by increasing their proprietary interest in Quanta. Prior to the
    adoption of the 2007 Plan, Quanta had issued awards of
    restricted common stock and stock options under its 2001 Stock
    Incentive Plan (as amended and restated March 13, 2003)
    (the 2001 Plan), which was terminated effective May 24,
    2007, except that outstanding awards will continue to be
    governed by the terms of the 2001 Plan. The 2007 Plan and the
    2001 Plan are referred to as the Quanta Plans.

In connection with the Merger, Quanta assumed InfraSource’s
    2003 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan and 2004 Omnibus Stock
    Incentive Plan, in each case as amended (the InfraSource Plans).
    Outstanding awards of InfraSource stock options were converted
    to options to acquire Quanta common stock, and outstanding
    awards



of InfraSource restricted common stock were converted to Quanta
    restricted common stock, each as described in further detail
    below. The InfraSource Plans were terminated in connection with
    the Merger, and no further awards will be made under these
    plans, although the terms of these plans will govern outstanding
    awards.

The 2007 Plan, which is the only plan sponsored by Quanta
    pursuant to which future awards may be made, provides for the
    award of incentive stock options (ISOs) as defined in
    Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended (the Code), nonqualified stock options and restricted
    stock (collectively, the Awards). The aggregate number of shares
    of common stock with respect to which options or restricted
    stock may be awarded may not exceed 4,000,000 shares of
    common stock. The 2007 Plan is administered by the Compensation
    Committee of the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee
    has, subject to applicable regulation and the terms of the 2007
    Plan, the authority to grant Awards under the 2007 Plan, to
    construe and interpret the 2007 Plan and to make all other
    determinations and take any and all actions necessary or
    advisable for the administration of the 2007 Plan, provided that
    the Board, or authorized committee of the Board, may delegate to
    a committee of the Board designated as the Equity Grant
    Committee, consisting of one or more directors, the authority to
    grant limited Awards to eligible persons who are not executive
    officers or non-employee directors. Specifically, the Equity
    Grant Committee has the authority to award stock options and
    restricted stock, provided (i) the aggregate number of
    shares of common stock subject to stock options

and/or

shares of restricted stock awarded by the Equity Grant Committee
    in any calendar quarter does not exceed 100,000 shares (or
    20,000 shares in any calendar quarter with respect to any
    individual) and (ii) the aggregate value of restricted
    stock awarded by the Equity Grant Committee in any calendar
    quarter does not exceed $250,000 (or $25,000 with respect to any
    individual), in each case, determined based on the fair market
    value of the common stock on the date the restricted stock is
    awarded. In connection with the adoption of the 2007 Plan, the
    Board approved the designation of the Equity Grant Committee and
    appointed John R. Colson, Quanta’s Chairman of the Board
    and Chief Executive Officer, as sole member of the committee.

All of Quanta’s employees (including its executive officers
    and directors who are also employees), non-employee directors
    and certain consultants and advisors are eligible to receive
    awards under the 2007 Plan, but only its employees (including
    executive officers and directors who are also employees) are
    eligible to receive ISOs. Awards in the form of stock options
    are exercisable during the period specified in each stock option
    agreement and generally become exercisable in installments
    pursuant to a vesting schedule designated by the Compensation
    Committee or, if applicable, the Equity Grant Committee. No
    option will remain exercisable later than ten years after the
    date of award (or five years in the case of ISOs awarded to
    employees owning more than 10% of our voting capital stock). The
    exercise price for ISOs awarded under the 2007 Plan may be no
    less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on
    the date of award (or 110% in the case of ISOs awarded to
    employees owning more than 10% of our voting capital stock).
    Upon the exercise of new stock options, Quanta has historically
    issued shares of common stock rather than treasury shares or
    shares purchased on the open market, although the plan permits
    any of the three. Awards in the form of restricted stock are
    subject to forfeiture and other restrictions until they vest.
    Except in certain limited circumstances and with respect to
    restricted stock awards awarded by the Compensation Committee
    covering in the aggregate no more than 200,000 shares of
    common stock, any restricted stock award that vests on the basis
    of a grantee’s continuous service shall not provide for
    vesting that is any more rapid than annual pro rata vesting over
    a three year period, and any restricted stock award that vests
    upon the attainment of performance goals established by the
    Compensation Committee shall provide for a performance period of
    at least twelve months, in each case, as designated by the
    Compensation Committee or, if applicable, the Equity Grant
    Committee and as specified in each award agreement.

Stock
    Options

Beginning January 1, 2006, Quanta accounted for its stock
    options in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R); however,
    the effect of expensing the fair value of the stock options did
    not have a material impact on Quanta’s financial position
    or results or operations, as the number of unvested stock
    options remaining at the time of the adoption of
    SFAS 123(R) was not significant. No stock options have been
    granted by Quanta since November 2002. As of December 31,
    2007 and 2008, the number of options outstanding under the 2001
    Plan,



all of which have vested, was not material. Options granted
    under the InfraSource Plans assumed in connection with the
    Merger are discussed below.

In connection with the Merger, each option to purchase shares of
    InfraSource common stock granted under the InfraSource Plans
    that was outstanding on August 30, 2007 was converted into
    an option to purchase the number of whole shares of Quanta
    common stock that was equal to the number of shares of
    InfraSource common stock subject to that option immediately
    prior to the effective time of the Merger multiplied by 1.223.
    These options were converted on the same terms and conditions as
    applied to each such option immediately prior to the Merger. The
    exercise price for each InfraSource option granted was also
    adjusted by dividing the exercise price in effect immediately
    prior to the Merger for each InfraSource option by 1.223. The
    former InfraSource options generally vest over four years and
    have a maximum term of ten years; however, some options vested
    on August 30, 2007 due to change of control provisions in
    place in certain InfraSource option or management agreements,
    and there has been and may be additional accelerated vesting if
    the employment of certain option holders is terminated within a
    certain period following the Merger.

In connection with the Merger, Quanta calculated the fair value
    of the former InfraSource stock options as of August 30,
    2007 using the Black-Scholes model. Assumptions used in this
    model were based on historic estimates of both Quanta and
    InfraSource. Quanta estimated expected stock price volatility
    based on the historical volatility of Quanta’s common
    stock. The risk-free interest rate assumption included in the
    calculation is based upon observed interest rates appropriate
    for the expected life of the InfraSource options. The dividend
    yield assumption was based on Quanta’s intent not to issue
    a dividend. Quanta used the simplified method to calculate
    expected term. Forfeitures were estimated based on Quanta’s
    historical experience. The assumptions that were used to value
    the InfraSource stock options as of August 30, 2007 that
    were converted to options to acquire Quanta stock were as
    follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value above represents the total pre-tax
    intrinsic value, based on Quanta’s closing stock price of
    $19.80 on December 31, 2008, which would have been received
    by the option holders had all option holders exercised their
    options as of that date. Former InfraSource options exercised
    during the period from August 31, 2007 through
    December 31, 2007 had an intrinsic value of
    $8.1 million, generated $6.2 million of cash proceeds
    and generated $3.2 million of associated income tax
    benefit. Former InfraSource options exercised during the year
    ended December 31, 2008 had an intrinsic value of
    $11.1 million, generated $5.7 million of cash proceeds
    and generated $4.1 million of associated income tax
    benefit. The total number of shares related to in-the-money
    options exercisable on December 31, 2008 was 443,263. When
    stock options are exercised, Quanta has historically issued new
    shares to the option holders.

As of December 31, 2008, there was approximately
    $2.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
    related to unvested stock options issued under the InfraSource
    Plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted
    average period of 1.3 years. The total fair value of the
    stock options issued under the InfraSource Plans that vested
    during the period from September through December 2007 was
    $8.6 million, while the total fair value of the stock
    options under the InfraSource Plans that vested during the year
    ended December 31, 2008 was $4.3 million.

Restricted
    Stock

Under the Quanta Plans, Quanta issues restricted common stock at
    the fair market value of the common stock as of the date of
    issuance. The shares of restricted common stock issued are
    subject to forfeiture, restrictions on transfer and certain
    other conditions until they vest, which generally occurs over
    three years in equal annual installments. During the restriction
    period, the restricted stockholders are entitled to vote and
    receive dividends on such shares.

In connection with the Merger, each share of restricted common
    stock issued under the InfraSource Plans that was outstanding on
    August 30, 2007 was converted into 1.223 restricted shares
    of Quanta common stock. The shares of restricted common stock
    issued under the InfraSource Plans remain subject to forfeiture,
    restrictions on transfer and certain other conditions of the
    awards until they vest, which generally occurs in equal annual
    installments over three or four year periods commencing on the
    first anniversary of the grant date, with certain exceptions.
    During the restriction period, the restricted stockholders are
    entitled to vote and receive dividends on such shares. The
    vesting period for some holders of restricted stock accelerated
    and the forfeiture and transfer restrictions lapsed when their
    employment was terminated following the Merger.

During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008,
    Quanta granted 0.7 million, 0.4 million and
    0.8 million shares of restricted stock under the Quanta
    Plans with a weighted average grant price of $13.98, $25.72 and
    $23.57, respectively. During the years ended December 31,
    2006, 2007 and 2008, 1.2 million, 0.7 million and
    0.6 million shares vested with an approximate fair value at
    the time of vesting of $16.9 million, $16.9 million
    and $15.0 million, respectively. Amounts granted in 2007
    include restricted shares that were issued on August 30,
    2007 upon conversion of the InfraSource restricted stock in
    connection with the Merger,



and vested amounts in 2007 and 2008 include restricted shares
    that vested under the InfraSource Plans following the Merger.

As of December 31, 2008, there was approximately
    $16.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
    related to unvested restricted stock granted to both employees
    and non-employees. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted average period of 1.68 years.

Compensation expense is measured based on the fair value of the
    restricted stock. For discretionary awards, compensation expense
    is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service period, which is generally the vesting period, and for
    performance based awards, compensation expense is recognized
    using the graded vesting method over the requisite service
    period. The fair value of the restricted stock is determined
    based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of
    Quanta’s common stock on the date of grant.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires estimating future forfeitures
    in determining the period expense, rather than recording
    forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. Quanta uses
    historical data to estimate the forfeiture rate; however, the
    estimate may not necessarily represent the value that will
    ultimately be realized as compensation expense.

Non-Cash
    Compensation Expense and Related Tax Benefits

The amounts of non-cash compensation expense and related tax
    benefits, as well as the amount of actual tax benefits related
    to vested restricted stock and options exercised and

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS:

Unions’
    Multi-Employer Pension Plans

Under collective bargaining agreements between certain unions
    and various Quanta subsidiaries, the subsidiaries participate
    with other companies in multi-employer pension plans. These
    plans typically cover all of the subsidiaries’ employees
    who are members of such unions. The Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension
    Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon
    employers who are contributors to a multi-employer plan in the
    event of the employer’s withdrawal from, or upon
    termination of, such plan. None of Quanta’s subsidiaries
    have any current plans to withdraw from these plans. Because no
    Quanta subsidiary is currently contemplating a withdrawal from
    any plan, it is not possible to ascertain the net assets and
    actuarial present value of the plans’ unfunded vested
    benefits allocable to any Quanta subsidiary, or the amounts, if
    any, for which any Quanta subsidiary may be contingently liable,
    if such a withdrawal from a plan were to occur in the future. In
    addition, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding
    rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007
    for multi-employer plans that are classified as
    “endangered,” “seriously endangered,” or
    “critical” status. For a plan in critical status,
    additional required contributions and benefit reductions apply;
    however, Quanta is not currently aware of any multi-employer
    plan to which any Quanta subsidiary contributes being in
    “critical” status. Contributions to all union
    multi-employer pension plans by Quanta were approximately
    $53.1 million, $69.7 million and $76.8 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008,
    respectively.

Quanta
    401(k) Plan

Quanta has a 401(k) plan pursuant to which employees who are not
    provided retirement benefits through a collective bargaining
    agreement may make contributions through a payroll deduction.
    Quanta makes matching cash contributions of 100% of each
    employee’s contribution up to 3% of that employee’s
    salary and 50% of each employee’s contribution between 3%
    and 6% of such employee’s salary, up to the maximum amount
    permitted by law. Prior to joining Quanta’s 401(k) plan,
    certain subsidiaries of Quanta provided various defined
    contribution plans to their employees. Contributions to all
    non-union defined contribution plans by Quanta were
    approximately $5.6 million, $6.1 million and
    $10.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2007 and 2008, respectively.

13.

RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

Certain of Quanta’s subsidiaries have entered into related
    party lease arrangements for operational facilities, typically
    with prior owners of certain acquired businesses. These lease
    agreements generally have terms of up to five years. Related
    party lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2007 and 2008 was approximately $2.6 million,
    $4.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively.

14.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES:

Leases

Quanta leases certain land, buildings and equipment under
    non-cancelable lease agreements, including related party leases
    as discussed in Note 13. The terms of these agreements vary
    from lease to lease, including



some with renewal options and escalation clauses. The following
    schedule shows the future minimum lease payments under these
    leases as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands):

Rent expense related to operating leases was approximately
    $78.3 million, $86.7 million and $107.2 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008,
    respectively.

Quanta has guaranteed the residual value on certain of its
    equipment operating leases. Quanta guarantees the difference
    between this residual value and the fair market value of the
    underlying asset at the date of termination of the leases. At
    December 31, 2008, the maximum guaranteed residual value
    was approximately $156.6 million. Quanta believes that no
    significant payments will be made as a result of the difference
    between the fair market value of the leased equipment and the
    guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no assurance
    that significant payments will not be required in the future.

Committed
    Capital Expenditures

Quanta has committed various amounts of capital for expansion of
    its dark fiber network. Quanta does not commit capital to new
    network expansions until it has a committed lease arrangement in
    place with at least one customer. The amounts of committed
    capital expenditures are estimates of costs required to build
    the networks under contract. The actual capital expenditures
    related to building the networks could vary materially from
    these estimates. As of December 31, 2008, Quanta estimates
    these expenditures to be approximately $70.9 million and
    $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2010.

Litigation

Quanta is also from time to time party to various lawsuits,
    claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary
    course of business. These actions typically seek, among other
    things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of
    contract

and/or

property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
    losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all
    such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, Quanta records reserves
    when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
    amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Quanta does not
    believe that any of these proceedings, separately or in the
    aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse effect
    on Quanta’s financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

Quanta is subject to concentrations of credit risk related
    primarily to its cash and cash equivalents and accounts
    receivable. Substantially all of Quanta’s cash investments
    are managed by what it believes to be high credit quality
    financial institutions. In accordance with Quanta’s
    investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest
    this cash in a diversified portfolio of what Quanta believes to
    be high quality investments, which consist primarily of
    interest-bearing demand deposits, money market mutual funds and
    investment grade commercial paper with original maturities of
    three months or less. Although Quanta does not currently believe
    the principal amount of these investments is subject to any
    material risk of loss, the recent volatility in the financial
    markets is likely to significantly impact the interest income
    Quanta receives from these investments. In addition, Quanta
    grants credit under normal payment terms, generally without
    collateral, to its customers,



which include electric power and gas companies,
    telecommunications and cable television system operators,
    governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners
    and managers of commercial and industrial properties located
    primarily in the United States. Consequently, Quanta is subject
    to potential credit risk related to changes in business and
    economic factors throughout the United States, which may be
    heightened as a result of the current financial crisis and
    volatility of the markets. However, Quanta generally has certain
    statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Under
    certain circumstances, such as foreclosures or negotiated
    settlements, Quanta may take title to the underlying assets in
    lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. In such
    circumstances, extended time frames may be required to liquidate
    these assets, causing the amounts realized to differ from the
    value of the assumed receivable. Historically, some of
    Quanta’s customers have experienced significant financial
    difficulties, and others may experience financial difficulties
    in the future. These difficulties expose Quanta to increased
    risk related to collectibility of receivables for services
    Quanta has performed. No customer accounted for more than 10% of
    accounts receivable as of December 31, 2008 or revenues for
    the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008.

Self-Insurance

Quanta is insured for employer’s liability claims, subject
    to a deductible of $1.0 million per occurrence, and for
    general liability and auto liability subject to a deductible of
    $3.0 million per occurrence. Quanta is also insured for
    workers’ compensation claims, subject to a deductible of
    $2.0 million per occurrence. Additionally, Quanta is
    subject to an annual cumulative aggregate liability of up to
    $1.0 million on workers’ compensation claims in excess
    of $2.0 million per occurrence. Quanta also has employee
    health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is
    subject to a deductible of $350,000 per claimant per year.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon Quanta’s estimates of the ultimate liability for
    claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not
    reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These
    insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due
    to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the
    determination of Quanta’s liability in proportion to other
    parties, the number of incidents not reported and the
    effectiveness of our safety program. The accruals are based upon
    known facts and historical trends and management believes such
    accruals to be adequate. As of December 31, 2007 and 2008,
    the gross amount accrued for insurance claims totaled
    $152.0 million and $147.9 million, with
    $110.1 million and $105.0 million considered to be
    long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Related
    insurance recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2007
    and 2008 were $22.1 million and $12.5 million, of
    which $11.9 million and $7.2 million are included in
    prepaid expenses and other current assets and $10.2 million
    and $5.3 million are included in other assets, net.

Quanta’s casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods
    from August 1, 2000 to February 28, 2003 has
    experienced financial distress. Effective September 29,
    2008, Quanta consummated a novation transaction that released
    this distressed casualty insurance carrier from all further
    obligations in connection with the policies in effect during
    that period in exchange for the payment to Quanta of an agreed
    amount. Quanta’s current casualty insurance carrier assumed
    all obligations under the policies in effect during that period;
    however, Quanta is obligated to indemnify the carrier in full
    for any liabilities under the policies assumed. At
    December 31, 2008, Quanta estimated that the total future
    claim amounts associated with the novated policies was
    $6.8 million, based on an estimate of the potential range
    of these future claim amounts at December 31, 2008 of
    between $2.0 million and $8.0 million. The actual
    amounts ultimately paid by Quanta in connection with these
    claims, if any, could vary materially from the above range and
    could be impacted by further claims development. During the
    second quarter of 2008, Quanta recorded an allowance of
    $3.4 million for potentially uncollectible amounts
    estimated to be ultimately due from the distressed insurer. As a
    result of the novation transaction, the net receivable balance
    remaining was written off in the third quarter of 2008, with an
    immaterial impact to the three and nine month periods ended
    September 30, 2008 as well as year ended December 31,
    2008.



Letters
    of Credit

Certain of Quanta’s vendors require letters of credit to
    ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on its
    behalf, such as to beneficiaries under its self-funded insurance
    programs. In addition, from time to time some customers require
    Quanta to post letters of credit to ensure payment to its
    subcontractors and vendors under those contracts and to
    guarantee performance under its contracts. Such letters of
    credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial
    institution. The letter of credit commits the issuer to pay
    specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the
    holder demonstrates that Quanta has failed to perform specified
    actions. If this were to occur, Quanta would be required to
    reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the
    circumstances of such a reimbursement, Quanta may also have to
    record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. Quanta does
    not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be
    made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2008, Quanta had $160.2 million in
    letters of credit outstanding under its credit facility
    primarily to secure obligations under its casualty insurance
    program. These are irrevocable stand-by letters of credit with
    maturities generally expiring at various times throughout 2009.
    Upon maturity, it is expected that the majority of these letters
    of credit will be renewed for subsequent one-year periods.

Performance
    Bonds and Parent Guarantees

In certain circumstances, Quanta is required to provide
    performance bonds in connection with its contractual
    commitments. Quanta has indemnified its sureties for any
    expenses paid out under these performance bonds. As of
    December 31, 2008, the total amount of outstanding
    performance bonds was approximately $918.9 million, and the
    estimated cost to complete these bonded projects was
    approximately $201.6 million.

Quanta, from time to time, guarantees the obligations of its
    wholly owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain
    contracts with customers, certain lease obligations and, in some
    states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors
    licenses.

Employment
    Agreements

Quanta has various employment agreements with certain executives
    and other employees, which provide for compensation and certain
    other benefits and for severance payments under certain
    circumstances. Certain employment agreements also contain
    clauses that become effective upon a change of control of
    Quanta. In addition, employment agreements between InfraSource
    and certain of its executives and employees included provisions
    that became effective upon termination of employment within a
    specified time period following the change of control of
    InfraSource. Upon the occurrence of any of the defined events in
    the various employment agreements, Quanta will pay certain
    amounts to the employee, which vary with the level of the
    employee’s responsibility.

Collective
    Bargaining Agreements

Certain of Quanta’s subsidiaries are party to various
    collective bargaining agreements with certain of their
    employees. The agreements require such subsidiaries to pay
    specified wages, provide certain benefits to their union
    employees and contribute certain amounts to multi-employer
    pension plans and employee benefit trusts. If the participating
    subsidiaries withdrew from, or otherwise terminated
    participation in, one or more multi-employer pension plans or
    the plans were to otherwise become underfunded, the subsidiaries
    could be assessed liabilities for additional contributions
    related to the underfunding of these plans. The collective
    bargaining agreements expire at various times and have typically
    been renegotiated and renewed on terms similar to the ones
    contained in the expiring agreements. For additional
    information, refer to Note 12, Employee Benefit
    Plans — Union’s Multi-Employer Pension Plans.



Indemnities

Quanta has indemnified various parties against specified
    liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in
    connection with Quanta’s previous acquisitions of certain
    companies. The indemnities under acquisition agreements usually
    are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that
    reach specified thresholds. Quanta also generally indemnifies
    its customers for the services it provides under its contracts,
    as well as other specified liabilities, which may subject Quanta
    to indemnity claims and liabilities and related litigation. As
    of December 31, 2008, Quanta is not aware of circumstances
    that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for
    material amounts in connection with these indemnity obligations.

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION:

Quanta reports its results under two business segments, which
    are the Infrastructure Services and Dark Fiber segments. The
    Infrastructure Services segment provides comprehensive network
    solutions to the electric power, gas, telecommunications and
    cable television industries, including designing, installing,
    repairing and maintaining network infrastructure. In addition,
    the Infrastructure Services segment provides ancillary services
    such as inside electrical wiring, intelligent traffic networks,
    cable and control systems for light rail lines, airports and
    highways, and specialty rock trenching, directional boring and
    road milling for industrial and commercial customers. The Dark
    Fiber segment designs, procures, constructs and maintains
    fiber-optic telecommunications infrastructure in select markets
    and licenses the right to use point-to-point fiber-optic
    telecommunications facilities to its customers. The Dark Fiber
    segment services educational institutions, large industrial and
    financial services customers and other entities with high
    bandwidth telecommunication needs. The telecommunication
    services provided through this business are subject to
    regulation by the Federal Communications Commission and certain
    state public utility commissions. The Dark Fiber segment was



acquired August 30, 2007 as part of the Merger.
    Accordingly, Quanta’s results of operations for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 only include four months of results
    from the dark fiber business, and segment reporting is only
    provided for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Corporate costs not readily identifiable to a reportable segment
    are allocated based upon each segment’s revenue
    contribution to consolidated revenues. The assets as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 and the revenues, operating

ITEM 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

There have been no changes in or disagreements with accountants
    on accounting and financial disclosure within the parameters of
    Item 304(b) of

Regulation S-K.

ITEM 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

are certifications of Quanta’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer that are required in accordance with

Rule 13a-14

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
    Act). This “Controls and Procedures” section includes
    information concerning the controls and controls evaluation
    referred to in the certifications, and it should be read in
    conjunction with the certifications for a more complete
    understanding of the topics presented.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management has established and maintains a system of
    disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide
    reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
    by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
    Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC rules and forms. The disclosure controls and procedures are
    also designed to provide reasonable assurance that such
    information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we
    evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to

Rule 13a-15(b)

of the Exchange Act. This evaluation was carried out under the
    supervision and with the participation of our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer. Based on this evaluation, these officers have concluded
    that, as of December 31, 2008, our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance of
    achieving their objectives.

Evaluation
    of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management’s Annual Report on internal control over
    financial reporting can be found in Item 8 of this Annual
    Report under the heading “Report of Management” and is
    incorporated herein by reference. The report of
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, on the financial statements, and its opinion on
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, can also be found in Item 8 of this Annual
    Report under the heading “Report of Independent Registered
    Public Accounting Firm” and is incorporated herein by
    reference.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2008, that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

Design
    and Operation of Control Systems

Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting
    will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control
    system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
    only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control
    system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control
    system must reflect the fact that there are resource
    constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
    relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent
    limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
    can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
    or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances
    of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These
    inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
    decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because
    of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can be circumvented by
    the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
    people, or by management override of the controls. The design of
    any system of controls is based in part



on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
    and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
    achieving its stated goals under all potential future
    conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of
    changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of
    compliance with policies or procedures.
