PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

General

Quanta Services, Inc. (Quanta) is a leading national provider of
    specialty contracting services, offering infrastructure
    solutions to the electric power, natural gas, oil and
    telecommunications industries. The services we provide include
    the design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of
    infrastructure within each of the industries we serve, such as
    electric power transmission and distribution networks and
    substation facilities, natural gas and oil transmission and
    distribution systems, and fiber optic, copper and coaxial cable
    networks used for video, data and voice transmission. We also
    design, procure, construct and maintain fiber optic
    telecommunications infrastructure in select markets and license
    the right to use these

point-to-point

fiber optic telecommunications facilities to customers.

We report our results under four reportable segments:
    (1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services,
    (2) Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services,
    (3) Telecommunications Infrastructure Services and
    (4) Fiber Optic Licensing. These reportable segments are
    based on the types of services we provide. Our consolidated
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were
    approximately $3.32 billion, of which 62% was attributable
    to the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment, 24% to
    the Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment,
    11% to the Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segment
    and 3% to the Fiber Optic Licensing segment.

We have established a nationwide presence with a workforce of
    over 14,500 employees, which enables us to quickly,
    reliably and cost-effectively serve a diversified customer base.
    We believe our reputation for responsiveness and performance,
    geographic reach, comprehensive service offering, safety
    leadership and financial strength have resulted in strong
    relationships with numerous customers, which include many of the
    leading companies in the industries we serve. Our ability to
    deploy services to customers throughout North America as a
    result of our broad geographic presence and significant scale
    and scope of services is particularly important to our customers
    who operate networks that span multiple states or regions. We
    believe these same factors also position us to take advantage of
    potential international opportunities.

We were organized as a corporation in the state of Delaware in
    1997, and since that time we have grown organically and made
    strategic acquisitions, expanding our geographic presence and
    scope of services and developing new capabilities to meet our
    customers’ evolving needs. In particular, in the past three
    years, we have completed two significant acquisitions, as well
    as several smaller acquisitions. On October 1, 2009, Quanta
    acquired Price Gregory Services, Incorporated (Price Gregory),
    which provides natural gas and oil transmission



pipeline infrastructure services in North America, specializing
    in the construction of large diameter transmission pipelines.
    The acquisition significantly expanded our existing natural gas
    and pipeline operations and, when combined with our electric
    power services, positions us as a leader in the North American
    energy transmission infrastructure market. Price Gregory’s
    financial results are generally included in Quanta’s
    Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment.
    Additionally, on August 30, 2007, we acquired, through a
    merger transaction, all of the outstanding common stock of
    InfraSource Services, Inc. (InfraSource). Similar to us,
    InfraSource provided design, procurement, construction, testing
    and maintenance services to electric power utilities, natural
    gas companies, telecommunications companies, government entities
    and heavy industrial companies, such as petrochemical processing
    and refining businesses, primarily in the United States. As a
    result of the acquisition of InfraSource, we enhanced and
    expanded our position as a leading specialized contracting
    services company. We continue to evaluate potential acquisitions
    of companies with strong management teams and good reputations
    to broaden our customer base, expand our geographic area of
    operation and grow our portfolio of services. We believe that
    our financial strength and experienced management team will be
    attractive to acquisition candidates.

We believe that our business strategies, along with our
    competitive and financial strengths, are key elements in
    differentiating us from our competition and position us to
    capitalize on future capital spending by our customers over the
    long-term. We offer comprehensive and diverse solutions on a
    broad geographic scale and have a solid base of long-standing
    customer relationships in each of the industries we serve. We
    also have an experienced management team, both at the executive
    level and within our operating units, and various proprietary
    technologies that enhance our service offerings. Our strategies
    of expanding the portfolio of services we provide to our
    existing and potential customer base, increasing our geographic
    and technological capabilities and promoting best practices and
    cross-selling our services to our customers, as well as
    continuing to maintain our financial strength, place us in a
    strong position to capitalize upon opportunities and trends in
    the industries we serve and to expand our operations globally.

Reportable
    Segments

The following is an overview of the types of services provided
    by each of our reportable segments and certain of the long-term
    industry trends impacting each segment. With respect to industry
    trends, we and our customers continue to operate in a
    challenging business environment in light of the economic
    downturn and weak capital markets. These factors have adversely
    affected demand for our services, and demand may continue to be
    impacted until conditions improve. Therefore, we cannot predict
    the timing or magnitude that industry trends may have on our
    business, particularly in the near-term.

Electric
    Power Infrastructure Services Segment

The Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment provides
    comprehensive network solutions to customers in the electric
    power industry. Services performed by the Electric Power
    Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design,
    installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power
    transmission and distribution networks and substation facilities
    along with other engineering and technical services. This
    segment also provides emergency restoration services, including
    repairing infrastructure damaged by inclement weather, the
    energized installation, maintenance and upgrade of electric
    power infrastructure utilizing unique bare hand and hot stick
    methods and our proprietary robotic arm technologies, and the
    installation of “smart grid” technologies on electric
    power networks. In addition, this segment designs, installs and
    maintains wind turbine facilities and solar arrays and related
    switchyards and transmission networks for renewable power
    generation sources. To a lesser extent, this segment provides
    services such as the design, installation, maintenance and
    repair of commercial and industrial wiring, installation of
    traffic networks and the installation of cable and control
    systems for light rail lines.

Several industry trends provide opportunities for growth in
    demand for the services provided by the Electric Power
    Infrastructure Services segment, including the need to improve
    the reliability of the aging power infrastructure, the expected
    long-term increase in demand for electric power and the
    incorporation of renewable energy and other new power generation
    sources into the North American power grid. We believe that we
    are the partner of choice for our electric power and renewable
    energy customers in need of broad infrastructure expertise,
    specialty equipment and workforce resources.



Demand for electricity in North America is expected to grow over
    the long-term, but the U.S. and Canadian electric power
    grids are aging, continue to deteriorate and lack redundancy.
    This increasing demand, coupled with the aging infrastructure,
    will affect reliability, requiring utilities to upgrade and
    expand their existing transmission and distribution systems.
    Further, current federal legislation requires the power industry
    to meet federal reliability standards for its transmission and
    distribution systems. We expect these system upgrades to result
    in increased spending and increased demand for our services over
    the long-term.

We consider renewable energy, including wind and solar, to be
    one of the largest, most rapidly emerging opportunities for our
    engineering, project management and installation services.
    Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the goal of
    reducing reliance on power generation from fossil fuels, are
    creating the need for more renewable energy sources. Renewable
    portfolio standards, which mandate that renewable energy
    constitute a specified percentage of a utility’s power
    generation, exist in many states. Additionally, several of the
    provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
    (ARRA) include incentives for investments in renewable energy,
    energy efficiency and related infrastructure. We believe that
    our comprehensive services, industry knowledge and experience in
    the design, installation and maintenance of renewable energy
    facilities will enable us to support our customers’
    renewable energy efforts.

As demand for power grows, the need for new power generation
    facilities will grow as well. The future development of new
    traditional power generation facilities, as well as renewable
    energy sources, will require new or expanded transmission
    infrastructure to transport power to demand centers. Renewable
    energy in particular often requires significant transmission
    infrastructure due to the remote location of renewable sources
    of energy. As a result, we anticipate that future development of
    new power generation will lead to increased demand over the
    long-term for our electric transmission design and construction
    services, and our substation engineering and installation
    services.

Natural
    Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services Segment

The Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment
    provides comprehensive network solutions to customers involved
    in the transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline
    products. Services performed by the Natural Gas and Pipeline
    Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design,
    installation, repair and maintenance of natural gas and oil
    transmission and distribution systems, compressor and pump
    stations and gas gathering systems, as well as related
    trenching, directional boring and automatic welding services. In
    addition, this segment’s services include pipeline
    protection, pipeline integrity and rehabilitation and
    fabrication of pipeline support systems and related structures
    and facilities. This segment also provides emergency restoration
    services, including repairing natural gas and oil pipeline
    infrastructure damaged by inclement weather. To a lesser extent,
    this segment designs, installs and maintains airport fueling
    systems as well as water and sewer infrastructure.

We see potential growth opportunities over the long-term in our
    natural gas operations, primarily in natural gas pipeline
    installation and maintenance services and related services for
    gas gathering systems and pipeline integrity. Ongoing
    development of gas shale formations throughout the United States
    has resulted in a significant increase in the natural gas supply
    as compared to several years ago, leading to a reduction in
    natural gas prices from the levels in the 2003 to 2008 period.
    Additionally, as the cleanest-burning fossil fuel, low-cost
    natural gas supports the U.S. goals of energy independence from
    foreign energy sources and a cleaner environment.

The U.S. Department of Energy has stated that most fossil
    fuel generation infrastructure built over the next two decades
    will likely be natural gas-fired power plants. In addition, as
    renewable energy generation continues to increase and become a
    larger percentage of the overall power generation mix, we
    believe natural gas will be the fuel of choice to provide backup
    power generation to offset renewable energy intermittency. We
    also anticipate that the above factors bode well for natural gas
    as a transitional fuel to nuclear power over the next several
    decades.

We believe the existing transmission pipeline infrastructure is
    insufficient to meet this growing natural gas demand even at
    current levels of consumption. For instance, it is estimated
    that it would take several years to build the transmission
    infrastructure to connect new sources of natural gas to demand
    centers throughout the U.S. Our



recent acquisition of Price Gregory, which significantly expands
    our natural gas services and positions us as a leading provider
    of transmission pipeline infrastructure services in North
    America, will allow us to take advantage of these opportunities.

The U.S. Department of Transportation has also implemented
    significant regulatory legislation through the Pipeline and
    Hazardous Materials Safety Administration relating to pipeline
    integrity requirements that we expect will increase the demand
    for our pipeline integrity and rehabilitation services over the
    long-term.

Telecommunications
    Infrastructure Services Segment

The Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segment
    predominantly provides comprehensive network solutions to
    customers in the telecommunications and cable television
    industries. Services performed by the Telecommunications
    Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design,
    installation, repair and maintenance of fiber optic, copper and
    coaxial cable networks used for video, data and voice
    transmission, as well as the design and installation of wireless
    communications towers and switching systems. This segment also
    provides emergency restoration services, including repairing
    telecommunications infrastructure damaged by inclement weather.
    To a lesser extent, services provided under this segment include
    cable locating, splicing and testing of fiber optic networks and
    residential installation of fiber optic cabling.

We believe that several of the large telecommunications
    companies remain committed to their fiber to the premises (FTTP)
    and fiber to the node (FTTN) initiatives over the long-term. We
    believe the rate of growth in fiber network build-outs will
    continue to increase over the long-term as more Americans look
    to next-generation networks for faster internet and more robust
    video services. While not all of the spending in the FTTP and
    FTTN initiatives will be for services that we provide, we
    believe that we are well-positioned to furnish infrastructure
    solutions for these initiatives throughout the United States. We
    also anticipate increased long-term opportunities arising from
    plans by several wireless companies to transition to 4G
    technology, as well as the installation of fiber optic
    “backhaul” to provide links from wireless cell sites
    to broader voice, data and video networks.

We also believe that certain provisions of the ARRA could create
    demand for our services over the long-term. Specifically, the
    ARRA includes funding provisions for the deployment of
    high-speed internet to rural areas that lack sufficient
    bandwidth to adequately support economic development, as well as
    funding to states for restoration, repair and construction of
    highways, which may create the need for relocation and upgrade
    of telecommunications infrastructure.

Fiber
    Optic Licensing Segment

The Fiber Optic Licensing segment designs, procures, constructs
    and maintains fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure in
    select markets and licenses the right to use these

point-to-point

fiber optic telecommunications facilities to its customers
    pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with lease terms
    from five to twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal
    options. Under those agreements, customers are provided the
    right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic
    facility, with the facility owned and maintained by us. The
    Fiber Optic Licensing segment provides services to educational
    and healthcare institutions, large industrial and financial
    services customers and other entities with high bandwidth
    telecommunication needs. The telecommunication services provided
    through this segment are subject to regulation by the Federal
    Communications Commission and certain state public utility
    commissions.

The growth opportunities in our Fiber Optic Licensing segment
    primarily relate to geographic expansion to serve customers who
    need secure high-speed networks, in particular education and
    healthcare institutions. Opportunities for geographic expansion
    exist in both our markets we currently serve, which entails
    expanding our existing network to add new customers, and new
    markets involving the build-out of new networks. Growth in this
    segment will generate the need for continued significant capital
    expenditures.

Financial
    Information about Geographic Areas

We operate primarily in the United States; however, we derived
    $71.5 million, $98.8 million and $112.2 million
    of our revenues from foreign operations, the majority of which
    was earned in Canada, during the years ended



December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. In
    addition, we held property and equipment in the amount of
    $9.0 million, $6.5 million and $57.1 million in
    foreign countries as of December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009,
    respectively.

Our business, financial condition and results of operations in
    foreign countries may be adversely impacted by monetary and
    fiscal policies, currency fluctuations, energy shortages,
    regulatory requirements and other political, social and economic
    developments or instability. Refer to Item 1A.

“Risk Factors”

for additional information.

Customers,
    Strategic Alliances and Preferred Provider
    Relationships

Our customers include electric power, natural gas, oil,
    telecommunications and cable television companies, as well as
    commercial, industrial and governmental entities. Our 10 largest
    customers accounted for approximately 32% of our consolidated
    revenues during the year ended December 31, 2009. Our
    largest customer accounted for approximately 5% of our
    consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Although we have a centralized marketing strategy, management at
    each of our operating units is responsible for developing and
    maintaining successful long-term relationships with customers.
    Our operating unit management teams build upon existing customer
    relationships to secure additional projects and increase revenue
    from our current customer base. Many of these customer
    relationships originated decades ago and are maintained through
    a partnering approach to account management that includes
    project evaluation and consulting, quality performance,
    performance measurement and direct customer contact. On an
    operating unit level, management maintains a parallel focus on
    pursuing growth opportunities with prospective customers. We
    continue to encourage operating unit management to cross-sell
    services of other operating units to their customers. In
    addition, our business development group promotes and markets
    our services for prospective large national accounts and
    projects that would require services from multiple operating
    units.

We strive to maintain our status as a preferred vendor to our
    customers. Many of our customers and prospective customers
    maintain a list of preferred vendors with whom the customer
    enters into a formal contractual agreement as a result of a

request-for-proposal

process. As a preferred vendor, we have met minimum standards
    for a specific category of service, maintain a high level of
    performance and agree to certain payment terms and negotiated
    rates.

We believe that our strategic relationships with customers in
    the electric power, natural gas, oil and telecommunications
    industries will continue to result in future opportunities. Many
    of these strategic relationships take the form of a strategic
    alliance or long-term maintenance agreement. Strategic alliance
    agreements generally state an intention to work together, and
    many provide us with preferential bidding procedures. Strategic
    alliances and long-term maintenance agreements are typically
    agreements for an initial term of approximately two to four
    years that may include an option to add extensions at the end of
    the initial term. Certain of our strategic alliance and
    long-term maintenance agreements are “evergreen”
    contracts with exclusivity clauses providing that we will be
    awarded all contracts, or giving us a right of first refusal for
    contracts, for a certain type of work or work in a certain
    geographic region.

Backlog

Backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to
    realize from work to be performed in the future on uncompleted
    contracts, including new contractual agreements on which work
    has not begun. The backlog estimates include amounts under
    long-term maintenance contracts in addition to construction
    contracts. We determine the amount of backlog for work under
    long-term maintenance contracts, or master service agreements
    (MSAs), by using recurring historical trends inherent in the
    current MSAs, factoring in seasonal demand and projected
    customer needs based upon ongoing communications with the
    customer. We also include in backlog our share of work to be
    performed under contracts signed by joint ventures in which we
    have an ownership interest. The following tables



present our total backlog by reportable segment as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 along with an estimate of the
    backlog amounts expected to be realized within 12 months of
    each balance sheet date (in $000’s):

Information quantifying our backlog by reportable segment was
    not captured for the 2007 period; however, our total backlog at
    December 31, 2007 was approximately $4.67 billion, of
    which the 12 month backlog was approximately $2.36 billion.

As discussed above, our backlog estimates include amounts under
    MSAs. In many instances, our customers are not contractually
    committed to specific volumes of services under our MSAs, and
    many of our contracts may be terminated with notice. There can
    be no assurance as to our customers’ requirements or that
    our estimates are accurate. In addition, many of our MSAs, as
    well as contracts for fiber optic licensing, are subject to
    renewal options. For purposes of calculating backlog, we have
    included future renewal options only to the extent the renewals
    can reasonably be expected to occur.

Competition

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We
    compete with other contractors in most of the geographic markets
    in which we operate, and several of our competitors are large
    domestic companies that have significant financial, technical
    and marketing resources. In addition, there are relatively few
    barriers to entry into some of the industries in which we
    operate and, as a result, any organization that has adequate
    financial resources and access to technical expertise may become
    a competitor. A significant portion of our revenues is currently
    derived from unit price or fixed price agreements, and price is
    often an important factor in the award of such agreements.
    Accordingly, we could be underbid by our competitors in an
    effort by them to procure such business. The current economic
    environment has increased the impacts of competitive pricing in
    certain of the markets that we serve. We believe that as demand
    for our services increases, customers will increasingly consider
    other factors in choosing a service provider, including
    technical expertise and experience, financial and operational
    resources, nationwide presence, industry reputation and
    dependability, which we expect to benefit larger contractors
    such as us. There can be no assurance, however, that our
    competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and
    resources to provide services that are superior in both price
    and quality to our services, or that we will be able to maintain
    or enhance our competitive position. We also face competition
    from the in-house service organizations of our existing or
    prospective customers, including electric power, natural gas and
    pipeline, telecommunications, cable television and engineering
    companies, which employ personnel who perform some of the same
    types of services as those provided by us. Although a
    significant portion of these services is currently outsourced by
    our customers, in particular relating to larger energy
    transmission infrastructure projects, there can be no assurance
    that our existing or prospective customers will continue to
    outsource services in the future.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we had 2,260 salaried employees,
    including executive officers, professional and administrative
    staff, project managers and engineers, job superintendents and
    clerical personnel, and 12,413 hourly employees, the number
    of which fluctuates depending upon the number and size of the
    projects we undertake at any particular time. Approximately 44%
    of our hourly employees at December 31, 2009 were covered
    by collective bargaining agreements, primarily with the
    International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the
    four pipeline construction trade unions administered by the Pipe
    Line Contractors Association (PLCA), which are the



Laborers International Union of North America, International
    Brotherhood of Teamsters, United Association of Plumbers and
    Pipefitters and the International Union of Operating Engineers.
    These collective bargaining agreements require the payment of
    specified wages to our union employees, the observance of
    certain workplace rules and the payment of certain amounts to
    multi-employer pension plans and employee benefit trusts rather
    than administering the funds on behalf of these employees. These
    collective bargaining agreements have varying terms and
    expiration dates. The majority of the collective bargaining
    agreements contain provisions that prohibit work stoppages or
    strikes, even during specified negotiation periods relating to
    agreement renewal, and provide for binding arbitration dispute
    resolution in the event of prolonged disagreement.

We provide health, welfare and benefit plans for employees who
    are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have a
    401(k) plan pursuant to which eligible employees who are not
    provided retirement benefits through a collective bargaining
    agreement may make contributions through a payroll deduction. We
    make matching cash contributions of 100% of each employee’s
    contribution up to 3% of that employee’s salary and 50% of
    each employee’s contribution between 3% and 6% of such
    employee’s salary, up to the maximum amount permitted by
    law.

Our industry is experiencing a shortage of journeyman linemen in
    certain geographic areas. In response to the shortage, we seek
    to take advantage of various IBEW and National Electrical
    Contractors Association (NECA) training programs and support the
    joint IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program which trains qualified
    electrical workers. We have also established apprenticeship
    training programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor
    for employees not subject to the IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship
    Program, as well as additional company-wide and project-specific
    employee training and educational programs.

We believe our relationships with our employees and union
    representatives are good.

Materials

Our customers typically supply most or all of the materials
    required for each job. However, for some of our contracts, we
    may procure all or part of the materials required. We purchase
    such materials from a variety of sources and do not anticipate
    experiencing any significant difficulties in procuring such
    materials.

Training,
    Quality Assurance and Safety

Performance of our services requires the use of equipment and
    exposure to conditions that can be dangerous. Although we are
    committed to a policy of operating safely and prudently, we have
    been and will continue to be subject to claims by employees,
    customers and third parties for property damage and personal
    injuries resulting from performance of our services. Our
    operating units have established comprehensive safety policies,
    procedures and regulations and require that employees complete
    prescribed training and service programs prior to performing
    more sophisticated and technical jobs, which is in addition to
    those programs required, if applicable, by the IBEW/NECA
    Apprenticeship Program, the training programs sponsored by the
    four trade unions administered by the PLCA or our equivalent
    programs. Under the IBEW/NECA Apprenticeship Program, all
    journeyman linemen are required to complete a minimum of
    7,000 hours of

on-the-job

training, approximately 200 hours of classroom education
    and extensive testing and certification. Certain of our
    operating units have established apprenticeship training
    programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor that
    prescribe equivalent training requirements for employees who are
    not otherwise subject to the requirements of the IBEW/NECA
    Apprenticeship Program. In addition, the Laborers International
    Union of North America, International Brotherhood of Teamsters,
    United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters and the
    International Union of Operating Engineers have training
    programs specifically designed for developing and improving the
    skills of their members who work in the pipeline construction
    industry. Our operating units also benefit from sharing best
    practices regarding their training and educational programs and
    comprehensive safety policies and regulations.

Regulation

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and
    international laws and regulations including:

•

licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to
    electricians and engineers;



•

building and electrical codes;

•

permitting and inspection requirements applicable to
    construction projects;

•

regulations relating to worker safety and environmental
    protection;

•

telecommunication regulations affecting our fiber optic
    licensing business; and

•

special bidding, procurement and other requirements on
    government projects.

We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our
    operations and that we are in substantial compliance with
    applicable regulatory requirements. Our failure to comply with
    applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or
    revocation of our operating licenses.

Environmental
    Matters and Climate Change Impacts

We are committed to the protection of the environment and train
    our employees to perform their duties accordingly. We are
    subject to numerous federal, state, local and international
    environmental laws and regulations governing our operations,
    including the handling, transportation and disposal of
    non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as
    emissions and discharges into the environment, including
    discharges to air, surface water and groundwater and soil. We
    also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability
    and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances
    into the environment. Under certain of these laws and
    regulations, such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of
    previously owned or operated properties, or properties to which
    hazardous substances or wastes were sent by current or former
    operations at our facilities, regardless of whether we directly
    caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of
    discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such
    substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or
    adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or use our
    properties as collateral for financing. In addition, we could be
    held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain
    environmental laws and regulations and also could be subject to
    a revocation of our licenses or permits, which could materially
    and adversely affect our business and results of operations.

From time to time, we may incur costs and obligations for
    correcting environmental noncompliance matters and for
    remediation at or relating to certain of our properties. We
    believe that we are in substantial compliance with our
    environmental obligations to date and that any such obligations
    will not have a material adverse effect on our business or
    financial performance.

The potential physical impacts of climate change on our
    operations are highly uncertain. Climate change may result in,
    among other things, changing rainfall patterns, changing storm
    patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels. As
    discussed below, our operating results are significantly
    influenced by weather. Therefore, significant changes in
    historical weather patterns could significantly impact our
    future operating results. For example, if climate change results
    in drier weather and more accommodating temperatures over a
    greater period of time in a given period, we may be able to
    increase our productivity, which could have a positive impact on
    our revenues and gross margins. In addition, if climate change
    results in an increase in severe weather, such as hurricanes and
    ice storms, we could experience a greater amount of higher
    margin emergency restoration service work, which generally has a
    positive impact on our gross margins. Conversely, if climate
    change results in a greater amount of rainfall, snow, ice or
    other less accommodating weather over a greater period of time
    in a given period, we could experience reduced productivity,
    which could negatively impact our revenues and gross margins.

Risk
    Management and Insurance

We are insured for employer’s liability, general liability,
    auto liability and workers’ compensation claims. As of
    August 1, 2009, we renewed our employer’s liability,
    general liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation
    policies for the current 2009 to 2010 policy year. As a result
    of the renewal, the deductibles for all policies have increased
    to $5.0 million per occurrence, other than employer’s
    liability which is subject to a deductible of $1.0 million.
    Additionally, in connection with this renewal, the amount of
    letters of credit required by us to secure our obligations under
    our casualty insurance program, which is discussed further
    below, has increased. We also have



employee health care benefit plans for most employees not
    subject to collective bargaining agreements, of which the
    primary plan is subject to a deductible of $350,000 per claimant
    per year. For the policy year ended July 31, 2009,
    employer’s liability claims were subject to a deductible of
    $1.0 million per occurrence, general liability and auto
    liability claims were subject to a deductible of
    $3.0 million per occurrence, and workers’ compensation
    claims were subject to a deductible of $2.0 million per
    occurrence. Additionally, for the same period, our workers’
    compensation claims were subject to an annual cumulative
    aggregate liability of up to $1.0 million on claims in
    excess of $2.0 million per occurrence. Our deductibles have
    varied in periods prior to August 1, 2008.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported
    and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
    assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance
    liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
    factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination
    of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of
    incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety
    program. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical
    trends, and management believes such accruals to be adequate. As
    of December 31, 2008 and 2009, the gross amount accrued for
    insurance claims totaled $147.9 million and
    $153.6 million, with $105.0 million and
    $109.8 million considered to be long-term and included in
    other non-current liabilities. Related insurance
    recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2008 and 2009
    were $12.5 million and $33.7 million, of which
    $7.2 million and $13.4 million are included in prepaid
    expenses and other current assets and $5.3 million and
    $20.3 million are included in other assets, net.

We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and
    therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may
    change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel our
    coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or
    the cost to obtain such coverage may become unreasonable. In any
    such event, our overall risk exposure would increase, which
    could have a material adverse impact on our business or
    financial performance.

Seasonality
    and Cyclicality

Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to
    seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced
    by weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, project
    schedules and timing and holidays. Typically, our revenues are
    lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or
    wet conditions cause delays. The second quarter is typically
    better than the first, as some projects begin, but continued
    cold and wet weather can often impact second quarter
    productivity. The third quarter is typically the best of the
    year, as a greater number of projects are underway and weather
    is more accommodating to work on projects. Revenues during the
    fourth quarter of the year are typically lower than the third
    quarter but higher than the second quarter. Many projects are
    completed in the fourth quarter and revenues often are impacted
    positively by customers seeking to spend their capital budget
    before the end of the year; however, the holiday season and
    inclement weather sometimes can cause delays and thereby reduce
    revenues and increase costs.

Working capital needs are generally higher during the summer and
    fall months due to increased construction activity in weather
    affected regions of the country. Conversely, working capital
    assets are typically converted to cash during the winter months.

Additionally, our industry can be highly cyclical. As a result,
    our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines or
    delays in new projects in various geographic regions in the
    United States. Project schedules, in particular in connection
    with larger, longer-term projects, can also create fluctuations
    in the services provided, which may adversely affect us in a
    given period. The financial condition of our customers and their
    access to capital, variations in the margins of projects
    performed during any particular period, regional, national and
    global economic and market conditions, timing of acquisitions,
    the timing and magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs,
    interest rate fluctuations and other factors may also materially
    affect our periodic results. Accordingly, our operating results
    for any particular period may not be indicative of the results
    that can be expected for any other period. An investor should

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties,
    including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties
    described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are
    not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not known to us or not described below also may
    impair our business operations. If any of the following risks
    actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of
    operations could be negatively affected and we may not be able
    to achieve our goals or expectations. This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

also includes statements reflecting assumptions, expectations,
    projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are
    intended as “forward-looking statements” under the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be
    read in conjunction with the section entitled

“Uncertainty of Forward-Looking Statements and
    Information”

included in Item 7.

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.”

Our
    operating results may vary significantly from quarter to
    quarter.

Our business can be highly cyclical and subject to seasonal and
    other variations that can result in significant differences in
    operating results from quarter to quarter. For example, we
    typically experience lower gross and operating margins during
    winter months due to lower demand for our services and more
    difficult operating conditions. Additionally, our quarterly
    results may be materially and adversely affected by:

•

variations in the margins of projects performed during any
    particular quarter;

•

unfavorable regional, national or global economic and market
    conditions;

•

a reduction in the demand for our services;

•

the budgetary spending patterns of customers;

•

increases in construction and design costs;

•

the timing and volume of work we perform;

•

the effects of adverse or favorable weather conditions;

•

the termination or expiration of existing agreements;

•

losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by
    insurance;

•

a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;

•

payment risk associated with the financial condition of our
    customers;

•

changes in bonding and lien requirements applicable to existing
    and new agreements;

•

implementation of various information systems, which could
    temporarily disrupt

day-to-day

operations;

•

the recognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax
    positions;

•

permitting, regulatory or customer caused delays;



•

decreases in interest rates we receive on our cash and cash
    equivalents;

•

changes in accounting pronouncements that require us to account
    for items differently than historical pronouncements have;

•

costs we incur to support growth internally or through
    acquisitions or otherwise;

•

the timing and integration of acquisitions and the magnitude of
    the related acquisition and integration costs; and

•

the timing and significance of potential impairments of
    long-lived assets, goodwill or other intangible assets.

Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may
    not be indicative of the results that you can expect for any
    other quarter or for the entire year.

The
    ongoing economic downturn and instability in the financial
    markets may adversely impact our customers’ future spending
    as well as payment for our services and, as a result, our
    operations and growth.

The U.S. economy is still recovering from the recent
    recession, and growth in economic activity has slowed
    substantially. The financial markets also have not fully
    recovered. It is uncertain when these conditions will
    significantly improve. Stagnant or declining economic conditions
    have adversely impacted the demand for our services and resulted
    in the delay, reduction or cancellation of certain projects and
    may continue to adversely affect us in the future. Additionally,
    our customers may finance their projects through the incurrence
    of debt or the issuance of equity. The availability of credit
    remains constrained, and many of our customers’ equity
    values have not fully recovered from the negative impact of the
    recession. A reduction in cash flow or the lack of availability
    of debt or equity financing may continue to result in a
    reduction in our customers’ spending for our services and
    may also impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed
    to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    operations and our ability to grow at historical levels.

An
    economic downturn in any of the industries we serve may lead to
    less demand for our services.

Because the vast majority of our revenue is derived from a few
    industries, a downturn in any of those industries would
    adversely affect our results of operations. Specifically, an
    economic downturn in any industry we serve could result in the
    delay, reduction or cancellation of projects by our customers as
    well as cause our customers to outsource less work, resulting in
    decreased demand for our services and potentially impacting our
    operations and our ability to grow at historical levels. A
    number of other factors, including financing conditions and
    potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve or a prolonged
    economic downturn or recession, could adversely affect our
    customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital
    expenditures in the future or pay for past services. For
    example, our Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segment
    has been negatively impacted since mid-2008 by the slowdown in
    fiber deployment initiatives from customers such as AT&T
    and Verizon, and we expect this slowdown will likely continue,
    at least in the near-term. We continue to see reduced spending
    in electric and natural gas distribution work under our Electric
    Power Infrastructure Services and Natural Gas and Pipeline
    Infrastructure Services segments due to capital expenditure
    reductions by our customers. Another area of business under our
    Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment, gas
    gathering and pipeline installation and maintenance, has also
    declined during 2009, which we believe is due to lower natural
    gas prices and capital constraints on spending by our customers.
    Consolidation, competition, capital constraints or negative
    economic conditions in the electric power, natural gas, oil and
    telecommunications industries may also result in reduced
    spending by, or the loss of, one or more of our customers.

Project
    performance issues, including those caused by third parties, or
    certain contractual obligations may result in additional costs
    to us, reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated
    damages.

In certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion by a
    scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance
    and performance testing levels. Many projects involve
    challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases
    that may occur over extended time periods, sometimes over
    several years. We may encounter difficulties as a result of
    delays in designs, engineering information or materials provided
    by the customer



or a third party, delays or difficulties in equipment and
    material delivery, schedule changes, delays from our
    customer’s failure to timely obtain permits or

rights-of-way,

weather-related delays and other factors, some of which are
    beyond our control, that impact our ability to complete the
    project in accordance with the original delivery schedule. In
    addition, we occasionally contract with third-party
    subcontractors to assist us with the completion of contracts.
    Any delay or failure by suppliers or by subcontractors in the
    completion of their portion of the project may result in delays
    in the overall progress of the project or may cause us to incur
    additional costs, or both. We also may encounter project delays
    due to local opposition, which may include injunctive actions as
    well as public protests, to the siting of electric power,
    natural gas or oil transmission lines, solar or wind projects,
    or other facilities. Delays and additional costs may be
    substantial and, in some cases, we may be required to compensate
    the customer for such delays. We may not be able to recover all
    of such costs. Failure to meet any of our schedules or
    performance requirements could also result in additional costs
    or penalties, including liquidated damages, and such amounts
    could exceed expected project profit. In extreme cases, the
    above-mentioned factors could cause project cancellations, and
    we may not be able to replace such projects with similar
    projects or at all. Such delays or cancellations may impact our
    reputation or relationships with customers, adversely affecting
    our ability to secure new contracts.

Our customers may change or delay various elements of the
    project after its commencement or the project schedule or the
    design, engineering information, equipment or materials that are
    to be provided by the customer or other parties may be deficient
    or delivered later than required by the project schedule,
    resulting in additional direct or indirect costs. Under these
    circumstances, we generally negotiate with the customer with
    respect to the amount of additional time required and the
    compensation to be paid to us. We are subject to the risk that
    we may be unable to obtain, through negotiation, arbitration,
    litigation or otherwise, adequate amounts to compensate us for
    the additional work or expenses incurred by us due to
    customer-requested change orders or failure by the customer to
    timely deliver items, such as engineering drawings or materials,
    required to be provided by the customer. Litigation or
    arbitration of claims for compensation may be lengthy and
    costly, and it is often difficult to predict when and for how
    much the claims will be resolved. A failure to obtain adequate
    compensation for these matters could require us to record a
    reduction to amounts of revenue and gross profit recognized in
    prior periods under the

percentage-of-completion

accounting method. Any such adjustments could be substantial. We
    may also be required to invest significant working capital to
    fund cost overruns while the resolution of claims is pending,
    which could adversely affect liquidity and financial results in
    any given period.

Under our contracts with our customers, we typically provide a
    warranty for the services we provide, guaranteeing the work
    performed against defects in workmanship and material. The
    majority of our contracts have a warranty period of
    12 months. As much of the work we perform is inspected by
    our customers for any defects in construction prior to
    acceptance of the project, the warranty claims that we have
    historically received have been minimal. Additionally, materials
    used in construction are often provided by the customer or are
    warranted against defects from the supplier. However, certain
    projects, such as utility-scale solar facilities, may have
    longer warranty periods and include facility performance
    warranties that may be broader than the warranties we generally
    provide. In these circumstances, if warranty claims occurred, it
    could require us to reperform the services or to repair or
    replace the warranted item, at a cost to us, and could also
    result in other damages if we are not able to adequately satisfy
    our warranty obligations. In addition, we may be required under
    contractual arrangements with our customers to warrant any
    defects or failures in materials we provide that we purchase
    from third parties. While we generally require the materials
    suppliers to provide us warranties that are consistent with
    those we provide to the customers, if any of these suppliers
    default on their warranty obligations to us, we may incur costs
    to repair or replace the defective materials for which we are
    not reimbursed. Costs incurred as a result of warranty claims
    could adversely affect our operating results and financial
    condition.

Our
    use of fixed price contracts could adversely affect our business
    and results of operations.

We currently generate a portion of our revenues under fixed
    price contracts. We also expect to generate a greater portion of
    our revenues under this type of contract in the future as a
    result of the acquisition of Price Gregory, which conducts most
    of its work through fixed price arrangements, and as larger
    projects, such as electric power transmission build-outs and
    utility-scale solar facilities, become a more significant aspect
    of our business. We must estimate the costs of completing a
    particular project to bid for fixed price contracts. The actual
    cost of labor and



materials, however, may vary from the costs we originally
    estimated, and we may bear the risk of certain unforeseen
    circumstances not included in our cost estimates for which we
    cannot obtain adequate compensation. These variations, along
    with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts,
    may cause actual revenue and gross profits for a project to
    differ from those we originally estimated and could result in
    reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending upon the
    size of a particular project, variations from the estimated
    contract costs could have a significant impact on our operating
    results for any fiscal period.

Our
    operating results can be negatively affected by weather
    conditions.

We perform substantially all of our services in the outdoors. As
    a result, adverse weather conditions, such as rainfall or snow,
    may affect our productivity in performing our services or may
    temporarily prevent us from performing services. The affect of
    weather delays on projects that are under fixed price
    arrangements may be greater if we are unable to adjust the
    project schedule for such delays. A reduction in our
    productivity in any given period or our inability to meet
    guaranteed schedules may adversely affect the profitability of
    our projects, and as a result, our results of operations.

Our
    use of

percentage-of-completion

accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of
    previously reported profits.

and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements
    included in Item 8 hereof, a significant portion of our
    revenues is recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting, utilizing the

cost-to-cost

method. This method is used because management considers
    expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on
    these contracts. This accounting method is generally accepted
    for fixed price contracts. The

percentage-of-completion

accounting practice we use results in our recognizing contract
    revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in
    proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or
    losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates
    of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses
    are recognized in full when determined to be probable and
    reasonably estimatable, and contract profit estimates are
    adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability.
    Further, a substantial portion of our contracts contain various
    cost and performance incentives. Penalties are recorded when
    known or finalized, which generally occurs during the latter
    stages of the contract. In addition, we record cost recovery
    claims when we believe recovery is probable and the amounts can
    be reasonably estimated. Actual collection of claims could
    differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or
    elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain
    circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be
    significant.

We may
    be unsuccessful at generating internal growth.

Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by,
    among other factors, our ability to:

•

expand the range of services we offer to customers to address
    their evolving network needs;

•

attract new customers;

•

increase the number of projects performed for existing customers;

•

hire and retain qualified employees;

•

expand geographically, including internationally; and

•

address the challenges presented by difficult economic or market
    conditions that may affect us or our customers.

In addition, our customers may cancel or delay or reduce the
    number or size of projects available to us due to their
    inability to obtain capital or pay for services provided, the
    risk of which has become evident in light of the continuing
    economic downturn. Many of the factors affecting our ability to
    generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we
    cannot be certain that our strategies for achieving internal
    growth will be successful.



As a
    result of the acquisition of Price Gregory, our profitability
    and financial condition may be adversely affected by risks
    associated with the natural gas and oil industry, such as price
    fluctuations and supply and demand for natural
    gas.

As a result of our acquisition of Price Gregory, our exposure to
    risks associated with providing services under our Natural Gas
    and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment have now increased
    due to the increase in the portion of our revenues attributable
    to these services. These risks, which are not subject to our
    control, include the volatility of natural gas prices, the lack
    of demand for power generation from natural gas and a slowdown
    in the discovery or development of natural gas and/or oil
    reserves. Specifically, lower natural gas and oil prices
    generally result in decreased spending by our Natural Gas and
    Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment customers. While higher
    natural gas and oil prices generally result in increased
    spending by these customers, sustained high energy prices could
    be an impediment to economic growth and could result in reduced
    spending by such customers. Additionally, higher prices will
    likely reduce demand for power generation from natural gas,
    which could result in decreased demand for the expansion of
    North America’s natural gas pipeline infrastructure, and
    consequently result in less capital spending by these customers
    and less demand for our services.

Further, if the discovery or development of natural gas and/or
    oil reserves slowed or stopped, customers would likely reduce
    capital spending on transmission pipelines, gas gathering and
    compressor systems and other related infrastructure, resulting
    in less demand for our services. If the profitability of our
    business under Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services
    segment were to decline, our overall profitability, results of
    operations and cash flows could also be adversely affected.

We may
    not realize all of the anticipated benefits from acquiring Price
    Gregory.

The success of our acquisition of Price Gregory will depend, in
    part, on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from
    acquiring Price Gregory, including the significant expansion of
    our operations in our Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure
    Services segment, certain eliminations of redundant costs and
    cross-selling opportunities with our other operations. To
    realize these benefits, however, we must successfully integrate
    the operations and personnel of Price Gregory into our business.
    If this integration is unsuccessful, the anticipated benefits of
    the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take
    longer or cost more to realize than expected. Because we and
    Price Gregory have previously operated as independent companies,
    it is possible the integration may result in the future loss of
    valuable employees, the disruption of our business or
    inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices,
    policies and compensation arrangements. Furthermore, Price
    Gregory was formed on January 31, 2008 through a
    combination of H.C. Price Company and Gregory & Cook
    Construction, Inc., both independently operated companies with
    separate ownership prior to the combination. Although
    substantial progress had been made at the time of the
    acquisition of Price Gregory, the integration of these two
    companies is continuing, and this integration may result in
    similar adverse impacts to our business. If we are unable to
    successfully complete these integrations, we may not fully
    realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of Price
    Gregory or we may be impacted negatively by the integration
    process, which could adversely affect our revenues, earnings and
    cash flows.

Our
    business is highly competitive.

The specialty contracting business is served by numerous small,
    owner-operated private companies, some public companies and
    several large regional companies. In addition, relatively few
    barriers prevent entry into some areas of our business. As a
    result, any organization that has adequate financial resources
    and access to technical expertise may become one of our
    competitors. Competition in the industry depends on a number of
    factors, including price. For example, we are currently
    experiencing the impacts of competitive pricing in certain of
    the markets we serve. Certain of our competitors may have lower
    overhead cost structures and, therefore, may be able to provide
    their services at lower rates than we are able to provide. In
    addition, some of our competitors have significant resources
    including financial, technical and marketing resources. We
    cannot be certain that our competitors do not have or will not
    develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide
    services that are superior in both price and quality to our
    services. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able
    to maintain or enhance our competitive position within the
    specialty contracting business or maintain our customer base at
    current levels. We also may face competition from the in-house
    service organizations of our existing or prospective



customers. Electric power, natural gas, oil and
    telecommunications service providers usually employ personnel
    who perform some of the same types of services we do, and we
    cannot be certain that our existing or prospective customers
    will continue to outsource services in the future.

Legislative
    actions and initiatives relating to electric power, renewable
    energy and telecommunications may fail to result in increased
    demand for our services.

Demand for our services may not result from renewable energy
    initiatives. While many states currently have mandates in place
    that require certain percentages of power to be generated from
    renewable sources, states could reduce those mandates or make
    them optional, which could reduce, delay or eliminate renewable
    energy development in the affected states. Additionally,
    renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce and may
    require additional power generation sources as backup. The
    locations of renewable energy projects are often remote and are
    not viable unless new or expanded transmission infrastructure to
    transport the power to demand centers is economically feasible.
    Furthermore, funding for renewable energy initiatives may not be
    available, which may be further constrained as a result of the
    current tight credit markets. These factors have resulted in
    fewer renewable energy projects than anticipated and a delay in
    the construction of these projects and the related
    infrastructure, which has adversely affected the demand for our
    services. These factors could continue to result in delays or
    reductions in projects, which could further negatively impact
    our business.

The ARRA provides for various stimulus programs, such as grants,
    loan guarantees and tax incentives, relating to renewable
    energy, energy efficiency and electric power and
    telecommunications infrastructure. We cannot predict when
    programs under the ARRA will be implemented, the timing and
    scope of any investments to be made under these programs or
    whether these programs will result in increased demand for our
    services. Investments for renewable energy, electric power
    infrastructure and telecommunications fiber deployment under
    ARRA programs may not occur, may be less than anticipated or may
    be delayed, any of which would negatively impact demand for our
    services.

In addition, other current and potential legislative initiatives
    may not result in increased demand for our services. For
    instance, certain provisions of the proposed American Clean
    Energy and Security Act (ACES Act) are intended to encourage
    electric power transmission and renewable energy projects.
    However, it is uncertain whether the ACES Act, if enacted, will
    positively impact infrastructure spending in the long-term.
    Specifically, the ACES Act may not result in the anticipated
    acceleration of future transmission projects or encourage the
    installation of renewable energy generation facilities, which
    could result in fewer electric power transmission and substation
    projects than anticipated and consequently adversely impact
    demand for our services. It is not certain when or if these
    legislative initiatives, including the ACES Act, will be enacted
    or whether any potentially beneficial provisions will be
    included in the final legislation.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Energy Act) requires the power
    industry to meet certain federal reliability standards for its
    transmission and distribution systems and provides incentives to
    the industry to invest in and improve maintenance on its
    systems. However, regulations implementing various components of
    the Energy Act that could affect demand for our services remain
    subject to uncertainty. Accordingly, the effect of these
    regulations, once finally implemented, cannot be predicted. As a
    result, the legislation may not result in increased spending on
    electric power transmission infrastructure or increased demand
    for our services.

There are also a number of other legislative and regulatory
    proposals, including the ACES Act, to address greenhouse gas
    emissions, which are in various phases of discussion or
    implementation. The outcome of federal and state actions to
    address global climate change could negatively affect the
    operations of our customers through costs of compliance or
    restraints on projects, which could reduce their demand for our
    services.

Many
    of our contracts may be canceled on short notice or may not be
    renewed upon completion or expiration, and we may be
    unsuccessful in replacing our contracts in such
    events.

We could experience a decrease in our revenue, net income and
    liquidity if any of the following occur:

•

our customers cancel a significant number of contracts or
    contracts having significant value;

•

we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts
    upon re-bid;



•

we complete a significant number of non-recurring projects and
    cannot replace them with similar projects; or

•

we fail to reduce operating and overhead expenses consistent
    with any decrease in our revenue.

Many of our customers may cancel our contracts on short notice,
    typically 30 to 90 days, even if we are not in default under the
    contract. Certain of our customers assign work to us on a

project-by-project

basis under master service agreements. Under these agreements,
    our customers often have no obligation to assign a specific
    amount of work to us. Our operations could decline significantly
    if the anticipated volume of work is not assigned to us, which
    will be more likely if customer spending continues to decrease,
    for example, due to the current economic downturn. Many of our
    contracts, including our master service agreements, are opened
    to public bid at the expiration of their terms. There can be no
    assurance that we will be the successful bidder on our existing
    contracts that come up for

re-bid.

Our
    business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and
    retain qualified employees.

Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will
    be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled
    personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We cannot be
    certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled
    labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our
    growth strategy. For instance, we may experience shortages of
    qualified journeyman linemen, who are integral to the provision
    of transmission and distribution services under our Electric
    Power Infrastructure Services segment. In addition, in our
    Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment, there
    is limited availability of experienced supervisors and foremen
    that can oversee large transmission pipeline projects. A
    shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel creates
    competitive hiring markets and may result in increased labor
    expenses. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair
    our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues.

Backlog
    may not be realized or may not result in profits.

Backlog is difficult to determine with certainty. Customers
    often have no obligation under our contracts to assign or
    release work to us, and many contracts may be terminated on
    short notice. Reductions in backlog due to cancellation of one
    or more contracts by a customer or for other reasons could
    significantly reduce the revenue and profit we actually receive
    from contracts included in backlog. In the event of a project
    cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but
    typically have no contractual right to the total revenues
    reflected in our backlog. The backlog we obtain in connection
    with any companies we acquire may not be as large as we believed
    or may not result in the revenue or profits we expected. In
    addition, projects may remain in backlog for extended periods of
    time. All of these uncertainties are heightened as a result of
    negative economic conditions and their impact on our
    customers’ spending. Consequently, we cannot assure you
    that our estimates of backlog are accurate or that we will be
    able to realize our estimated backlog.

Our
    financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that
    may differ from actual results.

In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States, several estimates and assumptions are used by management
    in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented
    and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to
    exist as of the date of the financial statements. These
    estimates and assumptions must be made because certain
    information that is used in the preparation of our financial
    statements is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated
    with a high degree of precision from data available or is not
    capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted
    methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly
    difficult to determine and we must exercise significant
    judgment. Estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful
    lives of assets, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill,
    other intangibles and long-lived asset impairments, valuation of
    derivative contracts, purchase price allocations, liabilities
    for self-insured claims, convertible debt, revenue recognition
    for construction contracts and fiber optic licensing,
    share-based compensation, operating results of reportable
    segments, provision for income taxes and calculation of
    uncertain tax positions. Actual results for all estimates could
    differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we
    use, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows.



Factors
    beyond our control may affect our ability to successfully
    execute our acquisition strategy, which may have an adverse
    impact on our growth strategy.

Our business strategy includes expanding our presence in the
    industries we serve through strategic acquisitions of companies
    that complement or enhance our business. We expect to face
    competition for acquisition opportunities, and some of our
    competitors may offer more favorable terms than us or have
    greater financial resources than we do. This competition may
    limit our acquisition opportunities and our ability to grow
    through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions
    and make them less accretive or possibly non-accretive to us.
    Acquisitions that we may pursue may also involve significant
    cash expenditures, the incurrence or assumption of debt or the
    issuance of securities. Any acquisition may ultimately have a
    negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows. In addition, if we issue equity
    securities in connection with our acquisitions, we may dilute
    our earnings per share and our shareholders’ percentage
    ownership.

We may
    be unsuccessful at integrating companies that either we have
    acquired or that we may acquire in the future.

As a part of our business strategy, we have acquired, and seek
    to acquire in the future, companies that complement or enhance
    our business. However, we cannot be sure that we will be able to
    successfully integrate each of these companies with our existing
    operations without substantial costs, delays or other
    operational or financial problems. If we do not implement proper
    overall business controls, our decentralized operating strategy
    could result in inconsistent operating and financial practices
    at the companies we acquire and our overall profitability could
    be adversely affected. Integrating our acquired companies
    involves a number of special risks that could have a negative
    impact on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations, including:

•

failure of acquired companies to achieve the results we expect;

•

diversion of our management’s attention from operational
    and other matters;

•

difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of
    acquired companies;

•

inability to retain key personnel of acquired companies;

•

risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities;

•

loss of business due to customer overlap;

•

risks arising from the prior operations of acquired companies,
    such as performance, safety or workforce issues; and

•

potential disruptions of our business.

If one of our acquired companies suffers or has suffered
    customer dissatisfaction, performance problems or operational
    issues, the reputation of our entire company could suffer.

Our
    results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of
    goodwill impairments.

When we acquire a business, we record an asset called
    “goodwill” equal to the excess amount we pay for the
    business, including liabilities assumed, over the fair value of
    the tangible and intangible assets of the business we acquire.
    For example, in connection with the acquisition of Price
    Gregory, we recorded approximately $68.5 million in
    goodwill and $76.5 million of intangible assets based on
    the application of acquisition accounting. Goodwill and other
    intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives cannot be
    amortized, but instead must be tested at least annually for
    impairment, while intangible assets that have finite useful
    lives are amortized over their useful lives. The accounting
    literature provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and
    other

non-amortized

intangible assets for impairment. Refer to Item 7.

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Critical
    Accounting Polices”

for a detailed discussion.
    Management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions
    when allocating goodwill to reporting units and determining the
    fair value of a reporting unit’s net assets and
    liabilities, including, among other things, an assessment of
    market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, cost
    of capital and growth rates, which could significantly impact
    the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair
    value is determined using a combination of the discounted cash
    flow,



market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches.
    Absent any impairment indicators, we perform our impairment
    tests annually during the fourth quarter. If there is a decrease
    in market capitalization below book value in the future, this
    may be considered an impairment indicator. Any future
    impairments, including impairments of the goodwill or intangible
    assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of Price
    Gregory, and other past or future acquisitions, would negatively
    impact our results of operations for the period in which the
    impairment is recognized.

Our
    profitability and financial operations may be negatively
    affected by changes in, or interpretations of, existing state or
    federal telecommunications regulations or new regulations that
    could adversely affect our Fiber Optic Licensing
    segment.

Many of our Fiber Optic Licensing segment customers benefit from
    the Universal Service

“E-rate”

program, which was established by Congress in the 1996
    Telecommunications Act and is administered by the Universal
    Service Administrative Company (USAC) under the oversight of the
    Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Under the

E-rate

program, schools, libraries and certain healthcare facilities
    may receive subsidies for certain approved telecommunications
    services, internet access and internal connections. From time to
    time, bills have been introduced in Congress that would
    eliminate or curtail the

E-rate

program. Passage of such actions by the FCC or USAC to further
    limit

E-rate

subsidies could decrease the demand by certain customers for the
    services offered by our Fiber Optic Licensing segment.

The telecommunications services we provide through our Fiber
    Optic Licensing segment are subject to regulation by the FCC, to
    the extent that they are interstate telecommunications services,
    and by state regulatory agencies, when wholly within a
    particular state. To remain eligible to provide services under
    the

E-rate

program, we must maintain telecommunications authorizations in
    every state where we operate, and we must obtain such
    authorizations in any new state where we plan to operate.
    Changes in federal or state regulations could reduce the
    profitability of our Fiber Optic Licensing segment, and delays
    in obtaining new authorizations could inhibit our ability to
    grow our Fiber Optic Licensing segment in new geographic areas.
    We could be subject to fines if the FCC or a state regulatory
    agency were to determine that any of our activities or positions
    are not in compliance with certain regulations. If the
    profitability of our Fiber Optic Licensing segment were to
    decline, or if the business of this segment were to become
    subject to fines, our overall results of operations and cash
    flows could also be adversely affected.

The
    business of our Fiber Optic Licensing segment is capital
    intensive and requires substantial investments, and returns on
    investments may be less than expected for various
    reasons.

The business of our Fiber Optic Licensing segment requires
    substantial amounts of capital investment to build out new fiber
    networks. In 2010, our proposed capital expenditures for our
    fiber optic licensing business is approximately
    $70.0 million, $12.1 million of which is related to
    committed licensing arrangements as of December 31, 2009.
    Although we generally do not commit capital to new networks
    until we have a committed license arrangement in place with at
    least one customer, we may not be able to recoup our initial
    investment in the network if that customer defaults on its
    commitment. Even if the customer does not default or we add
    additional customers to the network, we still may not realize a
    return on the capital investment for an extended period of time.
    Furthermore, the amount of capital that we invest in our fiber
    optic network may exceed planned expenditures as a result of
    various factors, including difficulty in obtaining permits or
    rights of way or unexpected increases in costs due to labor,
    materials or project productivity, which would result in a
    decrease in the returns on our capital investments if licensing
    fees for the network were committed and could not be
    renegotiated. New or developing technologies or significant
    competition in any of our markets could also negatively impact
    the business of our Fiber Optic Licensing segment. If any of the
    above events occur, it could adversely affect our results of
    operations or result in an impairment of our fiber optic network.



We
    extend credit to customers for purchases of our services and may
    enter into longer-term deferred payment arrangements or provide
    other financing or investment arrangements with certain of our
    customers, which subjects us to potential credit or investment
    risk that could, if realized, adversely affect our results of
    operations or financial condition.

We grant credit, generally without collateral, to our customers,
    which include electric power utilities, oil and gas companies,
    telecommunications and cable television system operators,
    governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners
    and managers of renewal energy facilities and commercial and
    industrial properties located primarily in the United States. We
    may also agree to allow our customers to defer payment on
    projects until certain milestones have been met or until the
    projects are substantially completed, although we generally
    obtain some form of financial assurance to ensure payment. In
    addition, we may provide other forms of financing or make
    investments in the projects we perform. Our payment arrangements
    with our customers subject us to potential credit or investment
    risk related to changes in business and economic factors
    affecting our customers. Some of our customers are currently
    experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the current
    economic downturn. If significant customers file for bankruptcy
    or continue to experience financial difficulties, (or if
    anticipated recoveries relating to receivables in existing
    bankruptcies or other workout situations fail to materialize),
    we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of
    current allowances provided or impairments of our investments.
    In addition, material changes in any of our customer’s
    revenues or cash flows could affect our ability to collect
    amounts due from them.

We are
    self-insured against potential liabilities.

Although we maintain insurance policies with respect to
    employer’s liability, general liability, auto and
    workers’ compensation claims, those policies are subject to
    deductibles ranging from $1.0 million to $5.0 million
    per occurrence depending on the insurance policy. We are
    primarily self-insured for all claims that do not exceed the
    amount of the applicable deductible. We also have employee
    health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is
    subject to a deductible of $350,000 per claimant per year.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported
    and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
    assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance
    liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
    factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination
    of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of
    incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety
    program. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical
    trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate. If
    we were to experience insurance claims or costs significantly
    above our estimates, our results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected in a given period.

During
    the ordinary course of our business, we may become subject to
    lawsuits or indemnity claims, which could materially and
    adversely affect our business and results of
    operations.

We have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a
    defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings during
    the ordinary course of our business. These actions may seek,
    among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury,
    workers’ compensation, employment discrimination, breach of
    contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or
    other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition,
    we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the
    services we provide and actions we take under our contracts with
    them, and, in some instances, we may be allocated risk through
    our contract terms for actions by our customers or other third
    parties. Because our services in certain instances may be
    integral to the operation and performance of our customers’
    infrastructure, we may become subject to lawsuits or claims for
    any failure of the systems that we work on, even if our services
    are not the cause of such failures, and we could be subject to
    civil and criminal liabilities to the extent that our services
    contributed to any property damage, personal injury or system
    failure. The outcome of any of these lawsuits, claims or legal
    proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of
    management’s attention to the business. Payments of
    significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely affect
    our reputation, liquidity and results of operations.



Unavailability
    or cancellation of third party insurance coverage would increase
    our overall risk exposure as well as disrupt our
    operations.

We maintain insurance coverage from third party insurers as part
    of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our
    contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage
    limits. There can be no assurance that any of our existing
    insurance coverage will be renewable upon the expiration of the
    coverage period or that future coverage will be affordable at
    the required limits. In addition, our third party insurers could
    fail, suddenly cancel our coverage or otherwise be unable to
    provide us with adequate insurance coverage. If any of these
    events occur, our overall risk exposure would increase and our
    operations could be disrupted. For example, we have significant
    operations in California, which has an environment conducive to
    wildfires. Should our insurer determine to exclude coverage for
    wildfires in the future, we could be exposed to significant
    liabilities and potentially a disruption of our California
    operations. If our risk exposure increases as a result of
    adverse changes in our insurance coverages, we could be subject
    to increased claims and liabilities that could negatively affect
    our results of operations and financial condition.

The
    departure of key personnel could disrupt our
    business.

We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and
    on senior management of our operating units, including the
    businesses we acquire. Although we have entered into employment
    agreements with terms of one to three years with most of our
    executive officers and certain other key employees, we cannot be
    certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for
    any particular period of time. The loss of key personnel, or the
    inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could
    negatively impact our ability to manage our business. We do not
    carry key-person life insurance on any of our employees.

Our
    unionized workforce and related obligations could adversely
    affect our operations.

As of December 31, 2009, approximately 44% of our hourly
    employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The
    acquisition of Price Gregory increased our unionized workforce,
    as substantially all of their hourly employees are unionized.
    Although the majority of the collective bargaining agreements
    prohibit strikes and work stoppages, we cannot be certain that
    strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future. Strikes
    or work stoppages would adversely impact our relationships with
    our customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease
    our revenue. Additionally, our collective bargaining agreements
    generally require us to participate with other companies in
    multi-employer pension plans. To the extent those plans are
    underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
    1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments
    Act of 1980, may subject us to substantial liabilities under
    those plans if we withdraw from them or they are terminated.
    Furthermore, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new
    funding rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after
    2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as
    “endangered,” “seriously endangered,” or
    “critical” status. For a plan in “critical”
    status, additional required contributions or benefit reductions
    may apply if a plan is determined to be underfunded, which could
    detrimentally affect our financial condition or results of
    operation. We have received notifications regarding the funded
    status of certain multi-employer plans to which Price Gregory
    contributes in certain states. Pursuant to the notifications,
    two plans were in “critical” status, one was in
    “seriously endangered” status and one was in
    “endangered” status, and in some cases additional
    contributions in the form of surcharges are required. Should we
    provide in the future a significant amount of services in areas
    that require us to utilize unionized employees covered by these
    affected plans, causing us to make substantial contributions, or
    should a determination be made that additional plans to which
    any of our operating units contribute are in a
    “critical” status requiring additional contributions,
    it could detrimentally affect our results of operations or
    financial condition if we are not able to adequately mitigate
    these costs.

Our ability to complete future acquisitions could be adversely
    affected because of our union status for a variety of reasons.
    For instance, our union agreements may be incompatible with the
    union agreements of a business we want to acquire and some
    businesses may not want to become affiliated with a union-based
    company. Additionally, we may increase our exposure to
    withdrawal liabilities for underfunded multi-employer pension
    plans to which an acquired company contributes. For example, the
    acquisition of Price Gregory increased the number of unions in
    which we participate, as well as the number of multi-employer
    pension plans to which we contribute, some of which are subject
    to notices of underfunded status as described above or may not
    otherwise be as well-funded as other



multi-employer pension funds to which we contribute, potentially
    increasing our exposure to underfunded status, which could
    detrimentally affect our financial condition or results of
    operation.

Approximately 56% of our hourly employees are not unionized. The
    new presidential administration has expressed strong support for
    proposed legislation that would create more flexibility and
    opportunity for labor unions to organize non-union workers. If
    passed, this legislation could result in a greater percentage of
    our workforce being subject to collective bargaining agreements,
    heightening the risks described above. In addition, certain of
    our customers require or prefer a non-union workforce, and they
    may reduce the amount of work assigned to us if our non-union
    labor crews were to become unionized, which could negatively
    affect our business and results of operations.

We may
    incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational
    impacts relating to occupational health and safety
    matters.

Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations
    relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace.
    While we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial
    resources in our occupational health and safety programs, our
    industry involves a high degree of operational risk and there
    can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability
    exposure. Although we have taken what we believe are appropriate
    precautions, we have suffered fatalities in the past and may
    suffer additional fatalities in the future. Serious accidents,
    including fatalities, may subject us to substantial penalties,
    civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Claims for damages to
    persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life,
    could result in substantial costs and liabilities, which could
    materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results
    of operations or cash flows. In addition, if our safety record
    were to substantially deteriorate over time or we were to suffer
    substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of
    health and safety regulations, our customers could cancel our
    contracts and not award us future business.

Risks
    associated with operating in international markets could
    restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business
    and prospects, and we could be adversely affected by our failure
    to comply with the laws applicable to our foreign activities,
    including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other
    similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.

While only a small percentage of our revenue is currently
    derived from international markets, we hope to continue to
    expand the volume of services that we provide internationally.
    Our international operations are presently conducted primarily
    in Canada, but we have performed work in South Africa, Mexico
    and various other foreign countries, and we expect that the
    number of countries that we operate in could expand
    significantly over the next few years. Economic conditions,
    including those resulting from wars, civil unrest, acts of
    terrorism and other conflicts or volatility in the global
    markets, may adversely affect our customers, their demand for
    our services and their ability to pay for our services. In
    addition, there are numerous risks inherent in conducting our
    business internationally, including, but not limited to,
    potential instability in international markets, changes in
    regulatory requirements applicable to international operations,
    currency fluctuations in foreign countries, political, economic
    and social conditions in foreign countries and complex
    U.S. and foreign laws and treaties, including tax laws and
    the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These risks
    could restrict our ability to provide services to international
    customers or to operate our international business profitably,
    and our overall business and results of operations could be
    negatively impacted by our foreign activities.

The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions
    prohibit U.S.-based companies and their intermediaries from
    making improper payments to

non-U.S. officials

for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We pursue
    opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience
    government corruption to some degree, and, in certain
    circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict
    with local customs and practices. Our policies mandate
    compliance with these anti-bribery laws. Further, we require our
    partners, subcontractors, agents and others who work for us or
    on our behalf that they are obligated to comply with the FCPA
    and other anti-bribery laws. Although we have policies and
    procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and our
    agents comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws, there
    is no assurance that such policies or procedures will protect us
    against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken
    by our agents, employees and intermediaries. If we are found to
    be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts or our
    inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we
    could suffer from severe criminal or civil penalties or



other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on
    our reputation, business, results of operations or cash flows.
    In addition, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or
    alleged FCPA violations is expensive and can consume significant
    time and attention of our senior management.

Our
    participation in joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or
    harm to our reputation for failures of our
    partners.

As part of our business, we have entered into joint venture
    arrangements and may enter into additional joint venture
    arrangements in the future. The purpose of these joint ventures
    is typically to combine skills and resources to allow for the
    performance of particular projects. Success on these jointly
    performed projects depends in large part on whether our joint
    venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations. We and
    our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally
    liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint
    ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is
    financially unable to bear its portion of required capital
    contributions or other obligations, including liabilities
    stemming from claims or lawsuits, we could be required to make
    additional investments, provide additional services or pay more
    than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our
    partner’s shortfall. Further, if we are unable to
    adequately address our partner’s performance issues, the
    customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal
    liability to us, harm our reputation and reduce our profit on a
    project. These risks have been heightened as a result of our
    assumption of additional joint venture arrangements in
    connection with our acquisition of Price Gregory.

We are
    in the process of implementing an information technology
    (“IT”) solution, which could temporarily disrupt

day-to-day

operations at certain operating units.

We have begun to implement a comprehensive IT solution that we
    believe will allow for a seamless interface between functions
    such as accounting and finance, human resources, operations, and
    fleet management. Continued development and implementation of
    the IT solution will require substantial financial and personnel
    resources. While the IT solution is intended to improve and
    enhance our information systems, implementation of new
    information systems at each operating unit exposes us to the
    risks of

start-up

of
    the new system and integration of that system with our existing
    systems and processes, including possible disruption of our
    financial reporting. Failure to properly implement the IT
    solution could result in substantial disruptions to our
    business, including coordinating and processing our normal
    business activities, testing and recording of certain data
    necessary to provide oversight over our disclosure controls and
    procedures and effective internal controls over our financial
    reporting, and other unforeseen problems.

Our
    dependence on suppliers, subcontractors and equipment
    manufacturers could expose us to the risk of loss in our
    operations.

On certain projects, we rely on suppliers to obtain the
    necessary materials and subcontractors to perform portions of
    our services. We also rely on equipment manufacturers to provide
    us with the equipment required to conduct our operations.
    Although we are not dependent on any single supplier,
    subcontractor or equipment manufacturer, any substantial
    limitation on the availability of required suppliers,
    subcontractors or equipment manufacturers could negatively
    impact our operations. The risk of a lack of available
    suppliers, subcontractors or equipment manufacturers is
    heightened under the current turbulent market conditions and
    economic downturn. To the extent we cannot engage subcontractors
    or acquire equipment or materials, we could experience losses in
    the performance of our operations.

Our
    business growth could outpace the capability of our corporate
    management infrastructure.

We cannot be certain that our infrastructure will be adequate to
    support our operations as they expand. Future growth also could
    impose significant additional responsibilities on members of our
    senior management, including the need to recruit and integrate
    new senior level managers and executives. We cannot be certain
    that we will be able to recruit and retain such additional
    managers and executives. To the extent that we are unable to
    manage our growth effectively, or are unable to attract and
    retain additional qualified management, we may not be able to
    expand our operations or execute our business plan.



Opportunities
    within the government arena could subject us to increased
    governmental regulation and costs.

Most government contracts are awarded through a regulated
    competitive bidding process. As we pursue increased
    opportunities in the government arena, management’s focus
    associated with the start up and bidding process may be diverted
    away from other opportunities. Involvement with government
    contracts could require a significant amount of costs to be
    incurred before any revenues are realized from these contracts.
    In addition, as a government contractor, we are subject to a
    number of procurement rules and other public sector liabilities,
    any deemed violation of which could lead to fines or penalties
    or a loss of business. Government agencies routinely audit and
    investigate government contractors. Government agencies may
    review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, cost
    structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and
    standards. If government agencies determine through these audits
    or reviews that costs were improperly allocated to specific
    contracts, they will not reimburse the contractor for those
    costs or may require the contractor to refund previously
    reimbursed costs. If government agencies determine that we
    engaged in improper activity, we may be subject to civil and
    criminal penalties. In addition, if the government were to even
    allege improper activity, we also could experience serious harm
    to our reputation. Many government contracts must be
    appropriated each year. If appropriations are not made in
    subsequent years we would not realize all of the potential
    revenues from any awarded contracts.

A
    portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety
    bonds. We may be unable to compete for or work on certain
    projects if we are not able to obtain the necessary surety
    bonds.

Current or future market conditions, including losses incurred
    in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate
    bankruptcies, as well as changes in our sureties’
    assessment of our operating and financial risk, could cause our
    surety providers to decline to issue or renew, or substantially
    reduce the amount of, bonds for our work and could increase our
    bonding costs. These actions could be taken on short notice. If
    our surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to
    bonding, our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity
    from other sureties, finding more business that does not require
    bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project
    performance, such as letters of credit or cash. We may be unable
    to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable
    terms, or at all, which could affect our ability to bid for or
    work on future projects requiring financial assurances.

We have also granted security interests in various of our assets
    to collateralize our obligations to our sureties. Furthermore,
    under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or
    continue bonds on a

project-by-project

basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the
    posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or
    renewing any bonds. If we were to experience an interruption or
    reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of
    these or any other reasons, we may be unable to compete for or
    work on certain projects that would require bonding.

Our
    failure to comply with environmental laws could result in
    significant liabilities.

Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and
    regulations, including those dealing with the handling and
    disposal of waste products, PCBs, fuel storage and air quality.
    We perform work in many different types of underground
    environments. If the field location maps supplied to us are not
    accurate, or if objects are present in the soil that are not
    indicated on the field location maps, our underground work could
    strike objects in the soil, some of which may contain
    pollutants. These objects may also rupture, resulting in the
    discharge of pollutants. In such circumstances, we may be liable
    for fines and damages, and we may be unable to obtain
    reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect
    information. As a result of our acquisition of Price Gregory, we
    expect an increase in the amount of work performed in and around
    environmentally sensitive areas such as rivers, lakes and
    wetlands. In addition, we perform directional drilling
    operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and
    water bodies. Due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and
    water bodies, it is possible that such directional drilling may
    cause a surface fracture, resulting in the release of subsurface
    materials. These subsurface materials may contain contaminants
    in excess of amounts permitted by law, potentially exposing us
    to remediation costs and fines. We also own and lease several
    facilities at which we store our equipment. Some of these
    facilities contain fuel storage tanks that are above or below
    ground. If these tanks were to leak, we could be responsible for
    the cost of remediation as well as potential fines.



In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of
    existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously
    unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new

clean-up

requirements could require us to incur significant costs or
    become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could
    negatively impact our financial condition and results of
    operations. In certain instances, we have obtained
    indemnification or covenants from third parties (including
    predecessors or lessors) for such cleanup and other obligations
    and liabilities that we believe are adequate to cover such
    obligations and liabilities. However, such third-party
    indemnities or covenants may not cover all of our costs, and
    such unanticipated obligations or liabilities, or future
    obligations and liabilities, may have a material adverse effect
    on our business operations, financial condition or cash flows.
    Further, we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify
    or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities
    relating to any acquired business.

There are also other legislative and regulatory proposals,
    including the ACES Act, to address greenhouse gas emissions.
    These proposals, if enacted, could result in a variety of
    regulatory programs including potential new regulations,
    additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, or
    other regulatory actions. Any of these actions could result in
    increased costs associated with our operations and impact the
    prices we charge our customers. For example, if new regulations
    are adopted regulating greenhouse gas emissions from mobile
    sources such as cars and trucks, we could experience a
    significant increase in environmental compliance costs in light
    of our large rolling-stock fleet. In addition, if our operations
    are perceived to result in high greenhouse gas emissions, our
    reputation could suffer.

We may
    not be successful in continuing to meet the requirements of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has many requirements applicable
    to us regarding corporate governance and financial reporting,
    including the requirements for management to report on our
    internal controls over financial reporting and for our
    independent registered public accounting firm to express an
    opinion over the operating effectiveness of our internal control
    over financial reporting. During 2009, we continued actions to
    ensure our ability to comply with these requirements. As of
    December 31, 2009, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective; however, there can be no assurance that
    our internal control over financial reporting will be effective
    in future years. Failure to maintain effective internal controls
    or the identification of significant internal control
    deficiencies in acquisitions already made or made in the future
    could result in a decrease in the market value of our common
    stock and our other publicly traded securities, the reduced
    ability to obtain financing, the loss of customers, penalties
    and additional expenditures to meet the requirements.

If we
    are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights or if our
    intellectual property rights become obsolete, our competitive
    position could be adversely impacted.

We utilize a variety of intellectual property rights in our
    services. We view our portfolio of proprietary energized
    services tools and techniques as well as our other process and
    design technologies as one of our competitive strengths, and we
    use it as part of our efforts to differentiate our service
    offerings. We may not be able to successfully preserve these
    intellectual property rights in the future and these rights
    could be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition,
    the laws of some foreign countries in which our services may be
    sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same
    extent as the laws of the United States. We also license certain
    technologies from third parties, and there is a risk that our
    relationships with licensors may terminate or expire or may be
    interrupted or harmed. If we are unable to protect and maintain
    our intellectual property rights, or if there are any successful
    intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings
    against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings
    could be reduced. In addition, if our intellectual property
    rights or work processes become obsolete, we may not be able to
    differentiate our service offerings, and some of our competitors
    may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers.
    As a result, our business and revenue could be materially and
    adversely affected.

We may
    not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance
    desired growth and operations.

If we cannot secure funds in the future, including financing on
    acceptable terms, we may be unable to support our growth
    strategy or future operations. We cannot readily predict the
    ability of certain customers to pay for past services, and the
    current economic downturn may negatively impact the ability of
    our customers to pay amounts owed to us. We also cannot readily
    predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts.
    Using cash for acquisitions limits our



financial flexibility and makes us more likely to seek
    additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our
    existing credit facility contains significant restrictions on
    our operational and financial flexibility, including our ability
    to incur additional debt or conduct equity financings, and if we
    seek more debt we may have to agree to additional covenants that
    limit our operational and financial flexibility. When we seek
    additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that
    additional debt or equity will be available to us on terms
    acceptable to us or at all, in particular under the current
    volatile market conditions. Furthermore, our credit facility is
    based upon existing commitments from several banks. With the
    current tight credit markets, banks have become more restrictive
    in their lending practices, and some may be unable or unwilling
    to fund their commitments, which may limit our access to the
    capital needed to fund our growth and operations. We also rely
    on financing companies to fund the leasing of certain of our
    trucks and trailers, support vehicles and specialty construction
    equipment. The current credit market may cause certain of these
    financing companies to restrict or withhold access to capital to
    fund the leasing of additional equipment. Although we are not
    dependent on any single equipment lessor, a widespread lack of
    available capital to fund the leasing of equipment could
    negatively impact our future operations. Additionally, the
    market price of our common stock may change significantly in
    response to various factors and events beyond our control, which
    will impact our ability to use equity to obtain funds. A variety
    of events may cause the market price of our common stock to
    fluctuate significantly, including overall market conditions or
    volatility, a shortfall in our operating results from those
    anticipated, negative results or other unfavorable information
    relating to our market peers on the risk factors described in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The
    industries we serve are subject to rapid technological and
    structural changes that could reduce the demand for the services
    we provide.

The electric power, gas and oil, telecommunications and cable
    television industries are undergoing rapid change as a result of
    technological advances that could, in certain cases, reduce the
    demand for our services, impair the value of our fiber optic
    network or otherwise negatively impact our business. New or
    developing technologies could displace the wireline systems used
    for voice, video and data transmissions, and improvements in
    existing technology may allow our Telecommunications
    Infrastructure Services segment customers to significantly
    improve their networks without physically upgrading them.

Our
    convertible subordinated notes may be convertible in the future,
    which, if converted, may result in dilution to existing
    stockholders, lower prevailing market prices for our common
    stock or cause a significant cash outlay.

As a result of our common stock satisfying the market price
    condition of our convertible subordinated notes, our 3.75%
    convertible subordinated notes due 2026 (3.75% Notes) have
    been convertible at the option of the holders at various times
    in the past. The 3.75% Notes are not presently convertible,
    but may resume convertibility in future periods upon
    satisfaction of the market price condition or other conditions.

We have the right to deliver shares of our common stock, cash or
    a combination of cash and shares of our common stock upon a
    conversion of the 3.75% Notes. The number of shares
    issuable upon conversion will be determined based on a
    conversion rate of approximately $22.41. In the event that all
    3.75% Notes were converted for common stock, we would issue
    an aggregate of 6.4 million shares of our common stock. The
    conversion of some or all of our 3.75% Notes into our
    common stock would dilute existing stockholders. Any sales in
    the public market of the common stock issued upon such
    conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of
    our common stock. In addition, the possibility that the notes
    may be converted may encourage short-selling by market
    participants because the conversion of the notes could depress
    the price of our common stock.

If we elect to satisfy the conversion obligation in cash, the
    amount of cash payable upon conversion of the 3.75% Notes
    will be determined by the product of (i) the number of
    shares issuable for the principal amount of the converted notes
    at a conversion rate of approximately $22.41 per share and
    (ii) the average closing price of our common stock during a

20-day

trading period following the holders unretracted election to
    convert the notes. To the extent we decide to pay cash to settle
    any conversions and the average closing price of our common
    stock during this



period exceeds $22.41 for the 3.75% Notes, we would have to
    pay cash in excess of the principal amount of the notes being
    converted, which would result in the recording of a loss on
    extinguishment of debt.

Certain
    provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an
    acquisition of our company more difficult.

The following provisions of our certificate of incorporation and
    bylaws, as currently in effect, as well as our stockholder
    rights plan and Delaware law, could discourage potential
    proposals to acquire us, delay or prevent a change in control of
    us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in
    the future for shares of our common stock:

•

our certificate of incorporation permits our Board of Directors
    to issue “blank check” preferred stock and to adopt
    amendments to our bylaws;

•

our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of
    stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be
    considered at stockholder meetings;

•

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right
    of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to
    act by written consent; and

•

we are subject to provisions of Delaware law which prohibit us
    from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions
    with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three
    years following the date such stockholder became classified as
    an interested stockholder.

ITEM 2.

Properties

Facilities

We lease our corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas and
    maintain other facilities throughout North America. Our
    facilities are used for offices, equipment yards, warehouses,
    storage and vehicle shops. As of December 31, 2009, we own
    36 of the facilities we occupy, many of which are encumbered by
    our credit facility, and we lease the remainder. We believe that
    our existing facilities are sufficient for our current needs.

Equipment

We operate a fleet of owned and leased trucks and trailers,
    support vehicles and specialty construction equipment, such as
    backhoes, excavators, trenchers, generators, boring machines,
    cranes, wire pullers and tensioners, all of which are encumbered
    by our credit facility. As of December 31, 2009, the total
    size of the rolling-stock fleet was approximately
    25,000 units. Most of this fleet is serviced by our own
    mechanics who work at various maintenance sites and facilities.
    We believe that these vehicles generally are well maintained and
    adequate for our present operations.

ITEM 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are from time to time a party to various lawsuits, claims and
    other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These actions typically seek, among other things,
    compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract

and/or

property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
    losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all
    such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record reserves when
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. None of these proceedings,
    separately or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material
    adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

On February 18, 2010, there were 1,732 holders of record of
    our common stock and 10 holders of record of our Limited
    Vote Common Stock. There is no established trading market for
    the Limited Vote Common Stock; however, the Limited Vote Common
    Stock converts into common stock immediately upon sale. See
    Note 11 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a
    description of our Limited Vote Common Stock.

Unregistered
    Sales of Securities During the Fourth Quarter of 2009

In October 2009, we completed the acquisition of two companies
    in which some of the consideration consisted of our unregistered
    securities of Quanta. The aggregate consideration paid in these
    transactions was $106.3 million in cash and
    11,096,733 shares of common stock. These acquisitions were
    not affiliated with any other acquisitions prior to such
    transactions.

All securities listed on the following table are shares of our
    common stock. We relied on Section 4(2) of the Securities
    Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), as the basis for
    exemption from registration. For all issuances, the purchasers
    were “accredited investors” as defined in
    Rule 501 of the Securities Act. All issuances were as a
    result of privately negotiated transactions, and not pursuant to
    public solicitations.

Dividends

We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to
    finance the growth, development and expansion of our business.
    Accordingly, we currently do not intend to declare or pay any
    cash dividends on our common stock in the immediate future. The
    declaration, payment and amount of future cash dividends, if
    any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after
    taking into account various factors. These factors include our
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flows from
    operations, current and anticipated capital requirements and
    expansion plans, the income tax laws then in effect and the
    requirements of Delaware law. In addition, as discussed in

“Debt Instruments — Credit Facility”

in Item 7

“Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations,”

our credit facility includes limitations
    on the payment of cash dividends without the consent of the
    lenders.



Performance
    Graph

The following Performance Graph and related information shall
    not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be
    “filed” with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
    nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any
    future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that
    we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.

The following graph compares, for the period from
    December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2009, the cumulative
    stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total
    return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (the
    S&P 500 Index), the Russell 2000 Index, a peer group index
    previously selected by our management that includes six public
    companies within our industry (the Peer Group). The comparison
    assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2004 in our
    common stock, the S&P 500 Index, the Russell 2000 Index and
    the Peer Group, and further assumes all dividends were
    reinvested. The stock price performance reflected on the
    following graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock
    price performance.

The Peer Group is composed of Dycom Industries, Inc., MasTec,
    Inc., Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., Shaw Group,
    Inc., Pike Electric Corporation and MYR Group Inc. MYR Group
    Inc. completed its initial public offering on August 12,
    2008. Accordingly, the Peer Group graph assumes $100 was
    invested in MYR Group Inc. on August 12, 2008. The
    companies in the Peer Group were selected because they comprise
    a broad group of publicly held corporations, each of which has
    some operations similar to ours. When taken as a whole, the Peer
    Group more closely resembles our total business than any
    individual company in the group.

ITEM 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations should be read in
    conjunction with our historical consolidated financial
    statements and related notes thereto in Item 8
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The
    discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are
    based upon our current expectations and are subject to
    uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may
    differ materially from these expectations due to inaccurate
    assumptions and known or unknown risks and uncertainties,
    including those identified in “Uncertainty of
    Forward-Looking Statements and Information” below and in
    Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

Introduction

We are a leading national provider of specialty contracting
    services, offering infrastructure solutions to the electric
    power, natural gas, oil and telecommunications industries. The
    services we provide include the design, installation, upgrade,
    repair and maintenance of infrastructure within each of the
    industries we serve, such as electric power transmission and
    distribution networks and substation facilities, natural gas and
    oil transmission and distribution systems, and fiber optic,
    copper and coaxial cable networks used for video, data and voice
    transmission. We also design, procure, construct and maintain
    fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure in select markets
    and license the right to use these

point-to-point

fiber optic telecommunications facilities to customers.

We report our results under four reportable segments:
    (1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services,
    (2) Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services,
    (3) Telecommunications Infrastructure Services and
    (4) Fiber Optic Licensing. These reportable segments are
    based on the types of services we provide. Our consolidated
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were
    approximately $3.32 billion, of which 62% was attributable
    to the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment, 24% to
    the Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment,
    11% to the Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segment
    and 3% to the Fiber Optic Licensing segment.

Our customers include many of the leading companies in the
    industries we serve. We have developed strong strategic
    alliances with numerous customers and strive to develop and
    maintain our status as a preferred vendor to our customers. We
    enter into various types of contracts, including competitive
    unit price, hourly rate, cost-plus (or time and materials
    basis), and fixed price (or lump sum basis), the final terms and
    prices of which we frequently negotiate with the customer.
    Although the terms of our contracts vary considerably, most are
    made on either a unit price or fixed price basis in which we
    agree to do the work for a price per unit of work performed
    (unit price) or for a fixed amount for the entire project (fixed
    price). We complete a substantial majority of our fixed price
    projects within one year, while we frequently provide
    maintenance and repair work under open-ended unit price or
    cost-plus master service agreements that are renewable
    periodically.

We recognize revenue on our unit price and cost-plus contracts
    as units are completed or services are performed. For our fixed
    price contracts, we record revenues as work on the contract
    progresses on a

percentage-of-completion

basis. Under this method, revenue is recognized based on the
    percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to
    total estimated costs to complete the contract. Fixed price
    contracts generally include retainage provisions under which a
    percentage of the contract price is withheld until the project
    is complete and has been accepted by our customer.

For internal management purposes, we are organized into three
    internal divisions, namely, the electric power division, the
    natural gas and pipeline division and the telecommunications
    division. These internal divisions are closely aligned with the
    reportable segments described above based on the predominant
    type of work provided by the operating units within a division.
    The operating units providing predominantly telecommunications
    and fiber optic licensing services are managed within the same
    internal division.

Reportable segment information, including revenues and operating
    income by type of work, is gathered from each operating unit for
    the purpose of evaluating segment performance in support of our
    market strategies. These classifications of our operating unit
    revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes can at
    times require judgment on the part of management. Our operating
    units may perform joint infrastructure service projects for
    customers in multiple industries, deliver multiple types of
    network services under a single customer contract or provide
    service across industries, for example, joint trenching projects
    to install distribution lines for electric power,



natural gas and telecommunication customers and the installation
    of broadband communication over electric power lines. Our
    integrated operations and common administrative support at each
    of our operating units requires that certain allocations,
    including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as
    facility costs, indirect operating expenses including
    depreciation and general and administrative costs, are made to
    determine operating segment profitability. Corporate costs, such
    as payroll and benefits, employee travel expenses, facility
    costs, professional fees, acquisition costs and amortization
    related to certain intangible costs are not allocated.

Prior to the second quarter of 2009, we reported our results
    under two business segments, with all of our operating segments,
    other than the operating segment comprising the Fiber Licensing
    segment, aggregated into the Infrastructure Services segment.
    During the second quarter of 2009, we reported our results under
    three reportable segments: (1) Electric & Gas
    Infrastructure Services, (2) Telecom & Ancillary
    Infrastructure Services and (3) Dark Fiber. The prior periods
    have been restated to reflect the change to the four reportable
    segments described above.

The Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment provides
    comprehensive network solutions to customers in the electric
    power industry. Services performed by the Electric Power
    Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design,
    installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power
    transmission and distribution networks and substation facilities
    along with other engineering and technical services. This
    segment also provides emergency restoration services, including
    repairing infrastructure damaged by inclement weather, the
    energized installation, maintenance and upgrade of electric
    power infrastructure utilizing unique bare hand and hot stick
    methods and our proprietary robotic arm technologies, and the
    installation of “smart grid” technologies on electric
    power networks. In addition, this segment designs, installs and
    maintains wind turbine facilities and solar arrays and related
    switchyards and transmission networks for renewable power
    generation sources. To a lesser extent, this segment provides
    services such as the design, installation, maintenance and
    repair of commercial and industrial wiring, installation of
    traffic networks and the installation of cable and control
    systems for light rail lines.

The Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment
    provides comprehensive network solutions to customers involved
    in the transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline
    products. Services performed by the Natural Gas and Pipeline
    Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design,
    installation, repair and maintenance of natural gas and oil
    transmission and distribution systems, compressor and pump
    stations and gas gathering systems, as well as related
    trenching, directional boring and automatic welding services. In
    addition, this segment’s services include pipeline
    protection, pipeline integrity and rehabilitation and
    fabrication of pipeline support systems and related structures
    and facilities. This segment also provides emergency restoration
    services, including repairing natural gas and oil pipeline
    infrastructure damaged by inclement weather. To a lesser extent,
    this segment designs, installs and maintains airport fueling
    systems as well as water and sewer infrastructure.

The Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segment
    predominantly provides comprehensive network solutions to
    customers in the telecommunications and cable television
    industries. Services performed by the Telecommunications
    Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design,
    installation, repair and maintenance of fiber optic, copper and
    coaxial cable networks used for video, data and voice
    transmission, as well as the design and installation of wireless
    communications towers and switching systems. This segment also
    provides emergency restoration services, including repairing
    telecommunications infrastructure damaged by inclement weather.
    To a lesser extent, services provided under this segment include
    cable locating, splicing and testing of fiber optic networks and
    residential installation of fiber optic cabling.

The Fiber Optic Licensing segment designs, procures, constructs
    and maintains fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure in
    select markets and licenses the right to use these

point-to-point

fiber optic telecommunications facilities to its customers
    pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with lease terms
    from five to twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal
    options. Under those agreements, customers are provided the
    right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic
    facility, with the facility owned and maintained by us. The
    Fiber Optic Licensing segment services educational and
    healthcare institutions, large industrial and financial services
    customers and other entities with high bandwidth
    telecommunication needs. The telecommunication services provided
    through this segment are subject to regulation by the Federal
    Communications Commission and certain state public utility
    commissions.



Recent
    Acquisitions

Price Gregory.

On October 1, 2009, we
    acquired Price Gregory Services, Incorporated (Price Gregory),
    which provides natural gas and oil transmission pipeline
    infrastructure services in North America. In connection with
    this acquisition, we issued approximately 10.9 million
    shares of our common stock valued at approximately
    $231.8 million and paid approximately $95.8 million in
    cash to the stockholders of Price Gregory. The results of Price
    Gregory have been included in our consolidated financial
    statements beginning on October 1, 2009. The acquisition
    significantly expands our existing natural gas and pipeline
    operations. In conjunction with this acquisition, we added the
    natural gas and pipeline division for internal management
    purposes. Because of the type of work performed by Price
    Gregory, its financial results will generally be included in the
    Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment.

Other 2009 Acquisitions.

Also during 2009, we
    completed three other acquisitions of specialty contractors with
    operations in the electric power, gas and telecommunications
    industries for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
    $36.0 million, consisting of a total of approximately
    $25.3 million in cash and 528,983 shares of our common
    stock valued in the aggregate at approximately
    $10.7 million at the dates of acquisition. These
    acquisitions enhance our electric, gas and pipeline and
    telecommunications capabilities throughout the various regions
    of the United States and Western Canada.

Seasonality;
    Fluctuations of Results

Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to
    seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced
    by weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, project
    schedules and timing and holidays. In general, our revenues are
    lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or
    wet conditions cause delays. The second quarter is typically
    better than the first, as some projects begin, but continued
    cold and wet weather can often impact second quarter
    productivity. The third quarter is typically the best of the
    year, as a greater number of projects are underway and weather
    is more accommodating to work on projects. Generally, revenues
    during the fourth quarter of the year are lower than the third
    quarter but higher than the second quarter. Many projects are
    completed in the fourth quarter, and revenues are often impacted
    positively by customers seeking to spend their capital budget
    before the end of the year; however, the holiday season and
    inclement weather sometimes can cause delays and thereby reduce
    revenues and increase costs.

Additionally, our industry can be highly cyclical. As a result,
    our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines or
    delays in new projects in various geographic regions in the
    United States. Project schedules, in particular in connection
    with larger, longer-term projects, can also create fluctuations
    in the services provided, which may adversely affect us in a
    given period. The financial condition of our customers and their
    access to capital, variations in the margins of projects
    performed during any particular period, regional, national and
    global economic and market conditions, timing of acquisitions,
    the timing and magnitude of acquisition and integration costs
    associated with acquisitions and interest rate fluctuations may
    also materially affect quarterly results. Accordingly, our
    operating results in any particular period may not be indicative
    of the results that can be expected for any period. You should

    challenges that may affect our financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

We and our customers are operating in a challenging business
    environment in light of the economic downturn and weak capital
    markets. We are closely monitoring our customers and the effect
    that changes in economic and market conditions have had or may
    have on them. We have experienced reduced spending by our
    customers in late 2008 and throughout 2009, which we attribute
    to negative economic and market conditions, and we anticipate
    that these negative conditions will continue to affect demand
    for our services in the near-term until conditions improve.
    However, we believe that most of our customers, many of whom are
    regulated utilities, remain financially stable in general and
    will be able to continue with their business plans in the
    long-term without substantial constraints. You should read

“Understanding Gross
    Margins”

for additional discussion of trends and
    challenges that may affect our financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.



Understanding
    Gross Margins

Our gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of
    revenues. Cost of services, which is subtracted from revenues to
    obtain gross profit, consists primarily of salaries, wages and
    benefits to employees, depreciation, fuel and other equipment
    expenses, equipment rentals, subcontracted services, insurance,
    facilities expenses, materials and parts and supplies. Various
    factors — some controllable, some not —
    impact our gross margins on a quarterly or annual basis.

Seasonal and Geographical.

As discussed above,
    seasonal patterns can have a significant impact on gross
    margins. Generally, business is slower in the winter months
    versus the warmer months of the year. This can be offset
    somewhat by increased demand for electrical service and repair
    work resulting from severe weather. In addition, the mix of
    business conducted in different parts of the country will affect
    margins, as some parts of the country offer the opportunity for
    higher gross margins than others due to the geographic
    characteristics associated with the physical location where the
    work is being performed. Such characteristics include whether
    the project is performed in an urban versus a rural setting or
    in a mountainous area or in open terrain. Site conditions,
    including unforeseen underground conditions, can also impact
    margins.

Weather.

Adverse or favorable weather
    conditions can impact gross margins in a given period. For
    example, it is typical in the first quarter of any fiscal year
    that parts of the country may experience snow or rainfall that
    may negatively impact our revenues and gross margin due to
    reduced productivity. In many cases, projects may be delayed or
    temporarily placed on hold. Conversely, in periods when weather
    remains dry and temperatures are accommodating, more work can be
    done, sometimes with less cost, which would have a favorable
    impact on gross margins. In some cases, severe weather, such as
    hurricanes and ice storms, can provide us with higher margin
    emergency restoration service work, which generally has a
    positive impact on margins.

Revenue Mix.

The mix of revenues derived from
    the industries we serve will impact gross margins, as certain
    industries provide higher margin opportunities. Additionally,
    changes in our customers’ spending patterns in each of the
    industries we serve can cause an imbalance in supply and demand
    and, therefore, affect margins and mix of revenues by industry
    served.

Service and Maintenance versus
    Installation.

Installation work is often obtained
    on a fixed price basis, while maintenance work is often
    performed under pre-established or negotiated prices or
    cost-plus pricing arrangements. Gross margins for installation
    work may vary from project to project, and can be higher than
    maintenance work, because work obtained on a fixed price basis
    has higher risk than other types of pricing arrangements. We
    typically derive approximately 50% of our annual revenues from
    maintenance work, but a higher portion of installation work in
    any given period may affect our gross margins for that period.

Subcontract Work.

Work that is subcontracted
    to other service providers generally yields lower gross margins.
    An increase in subcontract work in a given period may contribute
    to a decrease in gross margin. We typically subcontract
    approximately 10% to 15% of our work to other service providers.

Materials versus Labor.

Margins may be lower
    on projects on which we furnish materials as our

mark-up

on
    materials is generally lower than on labor costs. In a given
    period, a higher percentage of work that has a higher materials
    component may decrease overall gross margin.

Depreciation.

We include depreciation in cost
    of services. This is common practice in our industry, but it can
    make comparability to other companies difficult. This must be
    taken into consideration when comparing us to other companies.

Insurance.

Gross margins could be impacted by
    fluctuations in insurance accruals as additional claims arise
    and as circumstances and conditions of existing claims change.
    We are insured for employer’s liability, general liability,
    auto liability and workers’ compensation claims. As of
    August 1, 2009, we renewed our employer’s liability,
    general liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation
    policies for the current 2009 to 2010 policy year. As a result
    of the renewal, the deductibles for all policies have increased
    to $5.0 million per occurrence other than employer’s
    liability, which is subject to a deductible of
    $1.0 million. We also have employee health care benefit
    plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining
    agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible
    of $350,000 per claimant per year. For the policy year ended
    July 31, 2009, employer’s liability claims



were subject to a deductible of $1.0 million per
    occurrence, general liability and auto liability claims were
    subject to a deductible of $3.0 million per occurrence, and
    workers’ compensation claims were subject to a deductible
    of $2.0 million per occurrence. Additionally, through
    July 31, 2009, our workers’ compensation claims were
    subject to an annual cumulative aggregate liability of up to
    $1.0 million on claims in excess of $2.0 million per
    occurrence.

Performance Risk.

Margins may fluctuate
    because of the volume of work and the impacts of pricing and job
    productivity, which can be impacted both favorably and
    negatively by weather, geography, customer decisions and crew
    productivity. For example, when comparing a service contract
    between a current quarter and the comparable prior year’s
    quarter, factors affecting the gross margins associated with the
    revenues generated by the contract may include pricing under the
    contract, the volume of work performed under the contract, the
    mix of the type of work specifically being performed and the
    productivity of the crews performing the work. Productivity of a
    crew can be influenced by many factors, including where the work
    is performed (

e.g.,

rural versus urban area or
    mountainous or rocky area versus open terrain), whether the work
    is on an open or encumbered right of way, or the impacts of
    inclement weather. These types of factors are not practicable to
    quantify through accounting data, but each may have a direct
    impact on the gross margin of a specific project.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily
    of compensation and related benefits to management,
    administrative salaries and benefits, marketing, office rent and
    utilities, communications, professional fees, bad debt expense,
    acquisition costs, gains and losses on the sale of property and
    equipment, letter of credit fees and maintenance, training and
    conversion costs related to the implementation of an information
    technology solution.

Consolidated
    Results

Revenues.

Revenues decreased
    $462.1 million, or 12.2%, to $3.32 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2009. Electric power infrastructure
    services revenues decreased $233.7, or 10.2%, to
    $2.1 billion, telecommunications infrastructure services
    revenues decreased $158.4 million, or 29.5%, to
    $378.4 million and natural gas and pipeline infrastructure
    services revenues decreased $94.9 million, or 10.8%, to
    $784.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
    Overall, revenues were negatively impacted by decreases in the
    number and size of projects as a result of reduced capital
    spending by our customers. Additionally, revenues from electric
    power infrastructure services were also impacted by a decrease
    of approximately $126.5 million in revenues from emergency
    restoration services, from approximately $206.3 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 to approximately
    $79.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    due to work performed following hurricanes Fay, Gustav and Ike
    during the third and fourth quarters of 2008 in the Gulf Coast
    region of the United States. These decreases were partially
    offset by approximately $245.1 million in natural  gas and
    pipeline services revenues contributed  by Price Gregory for the
    period from October 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009.
    Additionally, revenues from fiber optic licensing increased
    $24.9 million, or 40.0%, to $87.3 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009. This increase in revenues is
    primarily a result of our continued network expansion and the
    associated revenues from licensing the right to use

point-to-point

fiber optic telecommunications facilities.

Gross profit.

Gross profit decreased
    $41.4 million, or 6.5%, to $593.5 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in gross profit
    resulted primarily from the effect of the decreased revenues
    discussed above. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin
    increased from 16.8% for the year ended December 31, 2008
    to 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily as
    a result of increased revenues from our higher margin electric
    transmission services combined with improved margins in
    telecommunications infrastructure services. Gross margins for
    our telecommunications infrastructure services were negatively
    affected in 2008 by losses on a project ongoing during the year,
    which resulted from substantial delays and productivity issues
    on the project. In addition, gross margins in 2009 were
    favorably impacted by increased fiber optic licensing revenues,
    which typically generate higher gross margins than our other
    services.



Selling, general and administrative
    expenses.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased $3.0 million, or 1.0%, to
    $312.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
    Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by
    $7.5 million for the period October 1, 2009 through
    December 31, 2009 as a result of the Price Gregory
    acquisition. In addition, acquisition and on-going integration
    costs of $2.8 million were incurred in 2009, primarily in
    connection with the Price Gregory acquisition. Also contributing
    to the increase were $8.0 million in net losses on sales of
    equipment during 2009, as compared to losses of
    $2.5 million in 2008. Included in the $8.0 million in
    net losses in 2009 was an impairment charge of $4.5 million
    for assets held for sale at December 31, 2009 related to
    natural gas segment equipment that was deemed to be duplicative
    as a result of the Price Gregory acquisition. These increases
    were partially offset by a decrease in performance bonuses of
    approximately $11.8 million. As a percentage of revenues,
    selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 8.2%
    to 9.4% primarily due to less ability to cover fixed costs as a
    result of lower revenues earned in 2009.

Amortization of intangible
    assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    increased $2.7 million to $39.0 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009. This increase is primarily due to
    increased amortization of backlog related to the acquisition of
    Price Gregory on October 1, 2009, partially offset by
    reduced amortization expense from previously acquired intangible
    assets as balances became fully amortized.

Interest expense.

Interest expense for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $20.7 million
    as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily
    due to the conversion, redemption and repurchase of all
    outstanding 4.5% convertible subordinated notes that occurred in
    September and early October of 2008.

Interest income.

Interest income was
    $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    compared to $9.8 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The decrease results primarily from
    substantially lower interest rates partially offset by a higher
    average cash balance for the year ended December 31, 2009
    as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.

Provision for income taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes was $70.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, with an effective tax rate of 30.0%. The
    provision for income taxes was $109.7 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, with an effective tax rate of
    41.0%. The lower effective tax rate for 2009 results primarily
    from $23.7 million of tax benefits recorded in 2009
    associated with decreases in reserves for uncertain tax benefits
    resulting from the expiration of various federal and state
    statutes of limitations.

    compared to 2007

Consolidated
    Results

Revenues.

Revenues increased
    $1.12 billion, or 42.3%, to $3.78 billion for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. Electric power infrastructure
    services revenues increased by approximately
    $609.9 million, or 36.1%, natural gas and pipeline
    infrastructure services revenues increased by approximately
    $411.3 million, or 87.8%, and telecommunications
    infrastructure services revenues increased by approximately
    $58.1 million, or 12.1%. Revenues increased primarily due
    to the full year contribution of revenues from the operations
    acquired through the acquisition of InfraSource, as compared to
    only a four month contribution to revenues from these operations
    in 2007 as the acquisition was completed on August 30,
    2007. Revenues were also favorably impacted by an increase of
    approximately $76.8 million in emergency restoration
    services, from approximately $130.9 million in 2007 to
    approximately $207.7 million in 2008, due primarily to the
    impact of hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region of the United
    States in 2008. Additionally, revenues increased due to an
    increased number and size of projects as a result of larger
    capital budgets for our customers, specifically in connection
    with electric transmission projects and certain natural gas
    transmission projects, as well as improved pricing; Lastly,
    revenues increased due to the impact of $44.9 million in
    additional revenues in 2008 from the Fiber Optic Licensing
    segment acquired as part of the InfraSource acquisition.

Gross profit.

Gross profit increased
    $206.1 million, or 48.1%, to $634.9 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in gross profit
    results primarily from the contribution of the InfraSource
    operations discussed previously coupled with the effect of
    increased revenues. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin
    increased from 16.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007
    to 16.8% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Gross
    margins were positively impacted in 2008 as compared to 2007 by
    improved pricing, the previously discussed increase in the
    amount of emergency restoration services, which typically
    generate higher margins, the



contribution of revenues from the higher margin Fiber Optic
    Licensing segment acquired as part of the InfraSource
    acquisition and better fixed costs absorption as a result of
    higher revenues. These positive factors were partially offset by
    declines in margins derived from telecommunications revenues due
    primarily to losses incurred in 2008 on a telecommunication
    project that resulted from substantial delays and  productivity
    issues during the third and fourth quarters of 2008.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased $68.9 million, or 28.6%, to
    $309.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was
    primarily a result of the addition of a full year’s
    administrative expenses associated with the InfraSource
    operations, as well as higher salaries and benefits associated
    with increased personnel, salary increases and increased
    performance bonuses. Bad debt expense increased
    $6.0 million in 2008 to $7.3 million primarily due to
    the economic downturn and volatile capital markets experienced
    during the second half of 2008. As a percentage of revenues,
    selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 9.0%
    in 2007 to 8.2% in 2008 primarily due to improved cost
    absorption as a result of higher revenues.

Amortization of intangible
    assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    increased $17.5 million to $36.3 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. This increase is attributable to
    the amortization of intangible assets associated with
    acquisitions completed since the beginning of 2007, primarily
    the acquisition of InfraSource completed on August 30, 2007.

Interest expense.

Interest expense decreased
    $7.3 million to $32.0 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, due to the conversion, redemption or
    repurchase of all of the remaining 4.5% convertible subordinated
    notes on or before October 8, 2008 and the maturity and
    repayment of the outstanding 4.0% convertible subordinated notes
    on July 2, 2007.

Interest income.

Interest income was
    $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to $20.0 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The decrease in interest income
    primarily relates to a lower average investment balance and
    lower average interest rates for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

Provision for income taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes was $109.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, with an effective tax rate of 41.0%,
    compared to a provision of $27.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, with an effective tax rate of 18.5%. The
    lower effective tax rate for 2007 resulted from
    $34.4 million of tax benefits recorded in 2007 primarily
    due to a decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions
    resulting from the settlement of a multi-year Internal Revenue
    Service audit in the first quarter of 2007 and the expiration of
    various federal and state tax statutes of limitations during the
    third quarter of 2007.

Electric
    Power Infrastructure Services Segment Results

Revenues for this segment decreased $233.7 million, or
    10.2%, to $2.07 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Revenues were negatively impacted by a
    decrease of approximately $126.5 million in revenues from
    emergency restoration services, from approximately
    $206.3 million in 2008 to approximately $79.8 million
    for 2009. This decrease resulted from work following hurricanes
    in the Gulf Coast region of the United States during 2008 which
    was only partially offset by emergency restoration services
    related to ice storms in the first quarter of 2009. Emergency
    restoration services associated with these hurricanes continued
    into the first quarter of 2009; however, no major hurricanes
    impacted the United States during 2009. Revenues were also
    negatively impacted by a decrease in electric power distribution
    services and other electric power infrastructure services
    primarily from reduced service work and capital spending by our
    customers, which was partially offset by increased revenues from
    electric transmission services related to an increased number of
    larger projects being performed in 2009.

Operating income decreased $21.6 million, or 8.7%, for the
    year ended December 31, 2009, as a result of  the reduced
    revenues discussed above. Operating income as a percentage of
    revenues increased slightly from 10.8% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 to 10.9% for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Although there was a substantial
    decrease in emergency restoration services in 2009, which
    typically generate higher margins, the increased contribution in
    2009 from higher margin electric transmission services as well
    as generally higher margins for other services in this segment
    offset this decrease. In addition, general and administrative
    expenses decreased approximately $6.2 million primarily due
    to decreased salaries and benefits expense associated with lower
    performance bonuses.

Natural
    Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services Segment
    Results

Revenues for this segment decreased $94.9 million, or
    10.8%, to $784.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. This decrease is primarily due to a
    decrease in gas distribution services of $73.4 million due
    to reduced capital spending by our customers resulting in
    reductions in the number and size of projects during the period.
    Additionally, natural gas transmission revenues contributed by
    Price Gregory, which was acquired on October 1, 2009, were
    approximately $245.1 million, which offset year over year
    decreases in other natural gas transmission revenues of
    $246.7 million resulting from larger projects during 2008
    that were not replaced in 2009.



Operating income decreased $13.5 million, or 17.7%, to
    $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as
    a result of the decreased revenues discussed above. Operating
    income as a percentage of revenues decreased from 8.7% for the
    year ended December 31, 2008 to 8.0% for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. The decrease in operating margins is
    primarily due to the lower overall revenues and the related
    impact on this segment’s ability to cover fixed costs,
    coupled with losses of $4.5 million on natural gas segment
    assets held for sale that were deemed to be duplicative assets
    as a result of the acquisition and integration of Price Gregory.
    These decreases were partially offset by the contribution of
    Price Gregory’s higher margin transmission pipeline work.

Telecommunications
    Infrastructure Services Segment Results

Revenues for this segment decreased $158.4 million, or
    29.5%, to $378.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 primarily due to reduced capital spending
    for fiber build-out initiatives during 2009. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, revenues from fiber build-out
    initiatives decreased approximately $114.5 million to
    approximately $147.8 million as compared to approximately
    $262.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    Revenues were also negatively impacted by a decrease in the
    number and size of other telecommunications projects as a result
    of overall reduced capital spending by our customers in 2009 as
    compared to 2008.

Operating income decreased $16.6 million, or 39.5%, to
    $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as
    a result of the decreased revenues discussed above. Operating
    income as a percentage of revenues decreased from 7.8% for the
    year ended December 31, 2008 to 6.7% for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. This decrease is a result of the lower
    overall revenues and the related impact on this segment’s
    ability to cover fixed costs during 2009.

Fiber
    Optic Licensing Segment Results

Revenues for this segment increased from $62.3 million, or
    40.0%, to $87.3 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. This increase in revenues is primarily a
    result of our continued network expansion and the associated
    revenues from licensing the right to use

point-to-point

fiber optic telecommunications facilities.

Operating income increased $11.4 million, or 34.7%, to
    $44.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as
    a result of the increased revenues discussed above. Operating
    income as a percentage of revenues decreased from 52.6% to 50.6%
    primarily as a result of the timing of various system
    maintenance costs.

Corporate
    and Non-allocated Costs

Certain selling, general and administrative expenses and
    amortization of intangible assets are not allocated to segments.
    Corporate and non-allocated costs for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 increased $6.8 million to
    $116.1 million primarily due to a $2.9 million
    increase in non-capitalized costs associated with an ongoing
    implementation of information technology solutions, coupled with
    acquisition and integration costs of approximately
    $2.8 million incurred in 2009, principally related to the
    Price Gregory acquisition, and an increase in amortization of
    intangible assets of $2.7 million. This increase in
    amortization of intangible assets is primarily due to increased
    amortization of backlog related to the acquisition of Price
    Gregory on October 1, 2009, partially offset by reduced
    amortization expense from previously acquired intangible assets
    as balances became fully amortized. These increases were
    partially offset by decreases due to lower salaries and benefits
    expense in 2009 associated with lower performance bonuses.

    compared to 2007

Electric
    Power Infrastructure Services Segment Results

Revenues for this segment increased $609.9 million, or
    36.1%, to $2.30 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. In addition to the contribution of
    revenues from the InfraSource operations for the full year 2008
    as compared to only four months in 2007, revenues were also
    positively impacted by an increased number and size of electric
    transmission projects as a result of larger capital budgets for
    our customers. Revenues were also positively impacted by an
    increase of approximately $75.4 million in emergency
    restoration services, from approximately



$130.9 million in 2007 to approximately $206.3 million
    for 2008, due primarily to work following hurricanes in the Gulf
    Coast region of the United States during 2008.

Operating income increased $87.3 million, or 54.4%, for the
    year ended December 31, 2008, as a result of the increased
    revenues discussed above. Operating income as a percentage of
    revenues increased from 9.5% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 to 10.8% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Contributing to these increases was the
    increase in emergency restoration services, which typically
    generate higher margins, and better fixed cost absorption as a
    result of higher revenues.

Natural
    Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services Segment
    Results

Revenues for this segment increased $426.1 million, or
    94.0%, to $879.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. In addition to the contribution of
    revenues from the InfraSource operations for the full year 2008
    as compared to only four months in 2007, revenues were also
    positively impacted due to an increased number and size of
    natural gas transmission pipeline projects as a result of larger
    capital budgets for our customers.

Operating income increased $56.2 million, to
    $76.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as
    a result of the increased revenues discussed above. Operating
    income as a percentage of revenues increased from 4.4% to 8.7%
    for the year ended December 31, 2008. These increases are
    due to higher overall revenues in 2008 and the related impact on
    this segment’s ability to cover fixed costs, as well as the
    larger contribution of higher margin natural gas transmission
    pipeline services work in 2008 versus 2007.

Telecommunications
    Infrastructure Services Segment Results

Revenues for this segment increased $43.3 million, or 8.8%,
    to $536.8 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008. In addition to the contribution of revenues from the
    Infrasource operations for the full year 2008 as compared to
    only four months in 2007, revenues were also positively impacted
    by increased revenues from fiber build-out initiatives for
    certain of our customers.

Operating income decreased $19.2 million, or 31.5%, to
    $41.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    Operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased from
    12.4% for the year ended December 31, 2007 to 7.8% for the
    year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease is primarily
    due to the replacement of a higher margin FTTx project that
    occurred in 2007 with a greater volume of FTTx projects that had
    lower margins in 2008. Also contributing to the decrease in
    operating income profitability for 2008 were losses recognized
    in 2008 associated with a telecommunications project that was
    profitable in 2007 but experienced substantial project delays
    and productivity issues in the third and fourth quarters of
    2008. Additionally, prior to the acquisition of InfraSource in
    August of 2007, Quanta provided higher margin services to what
    is now our Fiber Optic Licensing segment. Subsequent to the
    acquisition, these services are no longer for an external
    customer and are therefore excluded from our results of
    operations.

Fiber
    Optic Licensing Segment Results

Revenues for this segment increased from $17.4 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 to $62.3 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase in revenues
    is primarily a result of the inclusion of this segment for the
    full year in 2008 as compared to only four months in 2007 as
    this segment was acquired through our InfraSource acquisition in
    2007, as well as our continued network expansion and the
    associated revenues from licensing the right to use

point-to-point

fiber optic telecommunications facilities.

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008
    increased $24.1 million, or 276.1%, to $32.8 million,
    as a result of the increased revenues discussed above. Operating
    income as a percentage of revenues increased from 50.0% to 52.6%
    primarily as a result of the timing of various system
    maintenance costs.

Corporate
    and Non-allocated Costs

Certain selling, general and administrative expenses and
    amortization of intangible assets are not allocated to segments.
    Corporate and non-allocated costs for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 increased $28.6 million to
    $109.4 million primarily due to an increase in amortization
    of intangible assets of $17.5 million, primarily associated
    with intangibles acquired as part of the InfraSource acquisition
    in 2007, and an increase of $7.3 million



in stock-based compensation due to increased issuances as well
    as an increased number of restricted stock holders due to the
    acquisition of InfraSource. Additionally, bad debt expense
    increased $6.0 million in 2008 to $7.3 million
    primarily due to the economic downturn and volatile capital
    markets experienced during the second half of 2008, and we
    incurred $2.9 million in non-capitalizable costs associated
    with the implementation of an information technology solution.
    Partially offsetting these increases were decreased transaction
    costs of $1.7 million due to costs incurred in 2007 as part
    of the InfraSource acquisition, as well as lower levels of
    administration expenses due to the elimination of the previous
    InfraSource corporate office.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Cash
    Requirements

We anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, which
    totaled $699.6 million as of December 31, 2009,
    existing borrowing capacity under our credit facility, and our
    future cash flows from operations will provide sufficient funds
    to enable us to meet our future operating needs, debt service
    requirements and planned capital expenditures, as well as
    facilitate our ability to grow in the foreseeable future. We
    also evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions from time
    to time that may require cash.

Management continues to monitor the financial markets and
    general national and global economic conditions. We consider our
    cash investment policies to be conservative in that we maintain
    a diverse portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality cash
    investments with short-term maturities. We were in compliance
    with our covenants under our credit facility at
    December 31, 2009. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that
    the volatility in the capital markets will have a material
    impact on the principal amounts of our cash investments or our
    ability to rely upon our existing credit facility for funds. To
    date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash
    or cash equivalents or funds under our credit facility; however,
    we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash
    equivalents and funds under our credit facility will not be
    impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.

Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately
    $215 million for 2010. Approximately $70 million of
    the expected 2010 capital expenditures are targeted for the
    expansion of our fiber optic network, primarily in connection
    with committed customer arrangements.

Our 3.75% convertible subordinated notes due 2026
    (3.75% Notes) are not presently convertible into our common
    stock, although they have been convertible in certain prior
    quarters as a result of the satisfaction of the market price
    condition described in further detail in

“Debt
    Instruments — 3.75% Convertible Subordinated
    Notes”

below. The 3.75% Notes could become
    convertible in future periods upon the satisfaction of the
    market price condition or other conditions. If any holder of the
    convertible notes requests to convert their notes, we have the
    option to deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a
    combination thereof, with the amount of cash determined in
    accordance with the terms of the indenture under which the notes
    were issued.

Sources
    and Uses of Cash

As of December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents
    of $699.6 million, working capital of $1.09 billion
    and long-term obligations of $126.6 million, net of current
    maturities. These long-term obligations are our
    3.75% Notes, which have an aggregate principal amount of
    $143.8 million. We also had $188.3 million of letters
    of credit outstanding under our credit facility, leaving
    $286.7 million available for revolving loans or issuing new
    letters of credit.

Operating
    Activities

Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for
    our services, operating margins and the type of services we
    provide, but can also be influenced by working capital needs
    such as the timing of collection of receivables and the
    settlement of payables and other obligations. Working capital
    needs are generally higher during the summer and fall months due
    to increased services in weather affected regions of the
    country. Conversely, working capital assets are typically
    converted to cash during the winter months. Operating activities
    provided net cash to us of $376.9 million during 2009 as
    compared to $242.5 million during 2008 and
    $219.2 million during 2007. The increase in operating cash
    flows in 2009 as compared to 2008 is due primarily to the
    collection of



accounts receivable and large retainage balances that were
    outstanding at the end of 2008, along with the lower uses of
    cash for working capital requirements in 2009 compared to 2008
    as a result of lower overall levels of operating activity in the
    latter part of 2009. The increase in operating cash flows in
    2008 as compared to 2007 is due primarily to higher levels of
    income from year over year growth and contributions from work
    with higher profit margins, which was largely offset by cash
    outflows resulting from the higher working capital requirements
    associated with increased 2008 operating activity.

Investing
    Activities

During 2009, we used net cash in investing activities of
    $119.7 million as compared to $219.3 million and
    $120.6 million used in investing activities in 2008 and
    2007. Investing activities in 2009 included $165.0 million
    used for capital expenditures, partially offset by
    $9.1 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment.
    Additionally, investing activities in 2009 included
    $36.2 million of net cash acquired related primarily to our
    acquisition of Price Gregory. During 2008 and 2007, we used
    $185.6 million and $127.9 million for capital
    expenditures, partially offset by $15.4 million and
    $27.5 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. The
    increase in capital expenditures of $57.7 million in 2008
    compared to 2007 is related primarily to the growth in our
    business, in connection with our acquisition of InfraSource,
    and capital expenditure requirements of our Fiber Optic
    Licensing segment, which expended $73.9 million,
    $99.6 million and $23.7 million during 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Investing activities during 2008 also
    include $34.5 million in net cash outlays for three
    acquisitions and $14.6 million paid to secure patents and
    developed technology. Quanta made four acquisitions during 2007,
    including InfraSource. Investing cash flows in 2007 include
    $20.1 million in net cash outlays for these acquisitions,
    including $12.1 million of acquisition expenses related to
    the acquisition of InfraSource. The acquisition of InfraSource
    was accounted for under accounting guidance that considered
    acquisition-related costs to be a component of the total
    consideration paid for acquisitions and therefore included in
    goodwill on the balance sheet and in investing activities on the
    statement of cash flows. In 2009, this guidance has changed and
    such treatment of acquisition related costs is no longer
    allowed. Investing activities in the first quarter of 2007 also
    included purchases and sales of variable rate demand notes
    (VRDNs), which were classified as short-term investments
    available for sale and which were presented as such in our 2007
    investing activities. We have not invested in VRDNs after the
    first quarter of 2007.

Financing
    Activities

In 2009, financing activities provided net cash of
    $1.5 million as compared to $8.2 million provided by
    financing activities in 2008 and $78.9 million used in
    financing activities in 2007. Net cash provided by financing
    activities in 2009 resulted primarily from a $1.5 million
    tax impact from the vesting of stock-based equity awards,
    partially offset by cash inflows of $1.0 million from the
    exercise of stock options, coupled with $2.0 million in net
    proceeds from borrowings. Net cash provided by financing
    activities in 2008 resulted primarily from $6.0 million
    received from the exercise of stock options. Net cash used in
    financing activities in 2007 resulted primarily from a
    $60.5 million repayment of debt associated with the
    acquisition of InfraSource and a $33.3 million repayment of
    the 4.0% convertible subordinated notes.

Debt
    Instruments

Credit
    Facility

We have a credit facility with various lenders that provides for
    a $475.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility
    maturing on September 19, 2012. Subject to the conditions
    specified in the credit facility, borrowings under the credit
    facility are to be used for working capital, capital
    expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The entire
    unused portion of the credit facility is available for the
    issuance of letters of credit.

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    $188.3 million of letters of credit issued under the credit
    facility and no outstanding revolving loans. The remaining
    $286.7 million was available for revolving loans or issuing
    new letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the credit
    facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either
    (a) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the credit facility)
    plus 0.875% to 1.75%, as determined by the ratio of



our total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the
    credit facility), or (b) the base rate (as described below)
    plus 0.00% to 0.75%, as determined by the ratio of our total
    funded debt to consolidated EBITDA. Letters of credit issued
    under the credit facility are subject to a letter of credit fee
    of 0.875% to 1.75%, based on the ratio of our total funded debt
    to consolidated EBITDA. We are also subject to a commitment fee
    of 0.15% to 0.35%, based on the ratio of its total funded debt
    to consolidated EBITDA, on any unused availability under the
    credit facility. The base rate equals the higher of (i) the
    Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus


/


of 1% or (ii) the bank’s prime rate.

The credit facility contains certain covenants, including
    covenants with respect to maximum funded debt to consolidated
    EBITDA, maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA and minimum
    interest coverage, in each case as specified in the credit
    facility. For purposes of calculating the maximum funded debt to
    consolidated EBITDA ratio and the maximum senior debt to
    consolidated EBITDA ratio, our maximum funded debt and maximum
    senior debt are reduced by all cash and cash equivalents (as
    defined in the credit facility) held by us in excess of
    $25.0 million. As of December 31, 2009, we were in
    compliance with all of its covenants. The credit facility limits
    certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, capital
    expenditures, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and,
    subject to certain exceptions, prohibits liens on material
    assets. The credit facility also limits the payment of dividends
    and stock repurchase programs in any fiscal year except those
    payments or other distributions payable solely in capital stock.
    The credit facility provides for customary events of default and
    carries cross-default provisions with our existing subordinated
    notes, our continuing indemnity and security agreement with our
    sureties and all of our other debt instruments exceeding
    $15.0 million in borrowings. If an event of default (as
    defined in the credit facility) occurs and is continuing, on the
    terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the credit
    facility, amounts outstanding under the credit facility may be
    accelerated and may become or be declared immediately due and
    payable.

The credit facility is secured by a pledge of all of the capital
    stock of our U.S. subsidiaries, 65% of the capital stock of
    our foreign subsidiaries and substantially all of our assets.
    Our U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the repayment of all
    amounts due under the credit facility. Our obligations under the
    credit facility constitute designated senior indebtedness under
    our 3.75% Notes.

3.75% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

At December 31, 2009, we had outstanding
    $143.8 million aggregate principal amount of
    3.75% Notes. The resale of the notes and the shares
    issuable upon conversion thereof was registered for the benefit
    of the holders in a shelf registration statement filed with the
    SEC. The 3.75% Notes mature on April 30, 2026 and bear
    interest at the annual rate of 3.75%, payable semi-annually on
    April 30 and October 30, until maturity.

The $122.3 million and $126.6 million of convertible
    subordinated notes on the consolidated balance sheet as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2009 are presented net of a debt
    discount of $21.5 million and $17.2 million. The debt
    discount is amortized as interest expense over the remaining
    amortization period. The debt discount was recorded in
    accordance with the January 1, 2009 adoption of FSP APB

14-1

(ASC

470-20)

as
    discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial
    statements. The effective interest rate used to calculate total
    interest expense for the 3.75% Notes under FSP APB

14-1

(ASC

470-20)

was
    7.85%. At December 31, 2009, the remaining amortization
    period for the debt discount, which continues until the first
    repurchase right on April 30, 2013, is approximately
    3.3 years.

The 3.75% Notes are convertible into our common stock,
    based on an initial conversion rate of 44.6229 shares of
    our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 3.75% Notes
    (which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately
    $22.41 per share), subject to adjustment as a result of certain
    events. The 3.75% Notes are convertible by the holder
    (i) during any fiscal quarter if the closing price of our
    common stock is greater than 130% of the conversion price for at
    least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading
    days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
    fiscal quarter, (ii) upon us calling the 3.75% Notes
    for redemption, (iii) upon the occurrence of specified
    distributions to holders of our common stock or specified
    corporate transactions or (iv) at any time on or after
    March 1, 2026 until the business day immediately preceding
    the maturity date of the 3.75% Notes. The 3.75% Notes
    are not presently convertible, although they have been
    convertible in certain prior quarters as a result of the
    satisfaction of the market price condition in clause (i)
    above. If



the 3.75% Notes become convertible under any of these
    circumstances, we have the option to deliver cash, shares of our
    common stock or a combination thereof, with the amount of cash
    determined in accordance with the terms of the indenture under
    which the notes were issued. Conversions that may occur in the
    future could result in the recording of losses on extinguishment
    of debt if the conversions are settled in cash for an amount in
    excess of the principal amount. The holders of the
    3.75% Notes who convert their notes in connection with
    certain change in control transactions, as defined in the
    indenture, may be entitled to a make whole premium in the form
    of an increase in the conversion rate. In the event of a change
    in control, in lieu of paying holders a make whole premium, if
    applicable, we may elect, in some circumstances, to adjust the
    conversion rate and related conversion obligations so that the
    3.75% Notes are convertible into shares of the acquiring or
    surviving company.

Beginning on April 30, 2010 until April 30, 2013, we
    may redeem for cash all or part of the 3.75% Notes at a
    price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and
    unpaid interest, if the closing price of our common stock is
    equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion price then in
    effect for the 3.75% Notes for at least 20 trading days in
    the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day
    immediately prior to the date of mailing of the notice of
    redemption. In addition, we may redeem for cash all or part of
    the 3.75% Notes at any time on or after April 30, 2010
    at certain redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
    Beginning with the six-month interest period commencing on
    April 30, 2010, and for each six-month interest period
    thereafter, we will be required to pay contingent interest on
    any outstanding 3.75% Notes during the applicable interest
    period if the average trading price of the 3.75% Notes
    during the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding
    the last trading day before commencement of the applicable
    interest period equals or exceeds 120% of the principal amount
    of the notes. The contingent interest payable within any
    applicable interest period will equal an annual rate of 0.25% of
    the average trading price of the 3.75% Notes during a five
    trading day reference period.

The holders of the 3.75% Notes may require us to repurchase
    all or a part of the notes in cash on each of April 30,
    2013, April 30, 2016 and April 30, 2021, and in the
    event of a change in control of the company, as defined in the
    indenture, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal
    amount of the 3.75% Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.
    The 3.75% Notes carry cross-default provisions with our
    other debt instruments exceeding $20.0 million in
    borrowings, which includes our existing credit facility.

4.5% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

At December 31, 2008 and 2009, none of our 4.5% convertible
    subordinated notes due 2023 (4.5% Notes) were outstanding.
    During 2008, the holders of $269.8 million aggregate
    principal amount of 4.5% convertible subordinated notes due 2023
    (4.5% Notes) elected to convert their notes, resulting in
    the issuance of 24,229,781 shares of our common stock,
    substantially all of which followed a notice of redemption that
    we would redeem on October 8, 2008 all of the
    4.5% Notes outstanding pursuant to the indenture governing
    the notes. We also repurchased $106,000 aggregate principal
    amount of the 4.5% Notes on October 1, 2008 pursuant
    to the holders’ election and redeemed for cash $49,000
    aggregate principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid
    interest, on October 8, 2008. As a result of all of these
    transactions, none of the 4.5% Notes remained outstanding
    as of October 8, 2008. The 4.5% Notes were originally
    issued in October 2003 for an aggregate principal amount of
    $270.0 million and required semi-annual interest payments
    on April 1 and October 1 until maturity.

4.0% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

During the first half of 2007, we had outstanding
    $33.3 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0%
    convertible subordinated notes due 2007 (4.0% Notes), which
    matured on July 1, 2007. The outstanding principal balance
    of the 4.0% Notes plus accrued interest was repaid on
    July 2, 2007, the first business day after the maturity
    date.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Transactions

As is common in our industry, we have entered into certain
    off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of
    business that result in risks not directly reflected in our
    balance sheets. Our significant off-balance sheet transactions
    include liabilities associated with non-cancelable operating
    leases, letter of credit obligations, commitments to expand our
    fiber optic networks, surety guarantees, multi-employer pension
    plan liabilities and obligations relating to our joint venture
    arrangements. During the first quarter of 2009, two of our
    operating



units began operating in separate joint venture structures which
    contain risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets. In
    association with one of these joint ventures, we have guaranteed
    all of the obligations of the joint venture under the contract
    with the customer. Additionally, our second joint venture
    arrangement qualifies as a general partnership, for which we are
    jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of the
    joint venture. In each of these joint venture arrangements, each
    joint venturer has indemnified the other party for any
    liabilities incurred in excess of the liabilities for which the
    joint venturer is obligated to bear under the respective joint
    venture agreement. Other than as previously discussed, we have
    not engaged in any off-balance sheet financing arrangements
    through special purpose entities, and we have no material
    guarantees of the work or obligations of third parties.

Leases

We enter into non-cancelable operating leases for many of our
    facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow us to
    conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of
    facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them.
    We may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of
    its term, in which case we are typically liable to the lessor
    for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease.

We have guaranteed the residual value of the underlying assets
    under certain of our equipment operating leases at the date of
    termination of such leases. We have agreed to pay any difference
    between this residual value and the fair market value of each
    underlying asset as of the lease termination date. As of
    December 31, 2009, the maximum guaranteed residual value
    was approximately $133.4 million. We believe that no
    significant payments will be made as a result of the difference
    between the fair market value of the leased equipment and the
    guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no assurance
    that future significant payments will not be required.

Letters
    of Credit

Certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure
    reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf,
    such as to beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance
    programs. In addition, from time to time some customers require
    us to post letters of credit to ensure payment to our
    subcontractors and vendors under those contracts and to
    guarantee performance under our contracts. Such letters of
    credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial
    institution. The letter of credit commits the issuer to pay
    specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the
    holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified
    actions. If this were to occur, we would be required to
    reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the
    circumstances of such a reimbursement, we may also have to
    record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. We do not
    believe that it is likely that any claims will be made under a
    letter of credit in the foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2009, we had $188.3 million in
    letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility
    primarily to secure obligations under our casualty insurance
    program. These are irrevocable stand-by letters of credit with
    maturities generally expiring at various times throughout 2010.
    Upon maturity, it is expected that the majority of these letters
    of credit will be renewed for subsequent one-year periods.

Performance
    Bonds and Parent Guarantees

Many customers, particularly in connection with new
    construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds
    issued by a financial institution known as a surety. These bonds
    provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under
    the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and
    vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay
    subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the
    surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must
    reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs.
    Under our continuing indemnity and security agreement with our
    sureties and with the consent of our lenders under our credit
    facility, we have granted security interests in certain of our
    assets to collateralize our obligations to the sureties. In
    addition, under our agreement with the surety that issued bonds
    on behalf of InfraSource, which remains in place for any bonds
    that were outstanding under it on August 30, 2007 and have
    not expired or been replaced, we will be required to transfer to
    the surety certain of our assets as collateral in the event of a
    default under the agreement. We may be required to post letters
    of credit or other collateral in favor of the sureties or our
    customers in the future. Posting letters of credit in favor of
    the sureties or our customers would reduce the borrowing
    availability under our credit facility. To date, we have not
    been required to make any reimbursements to our sureties for
    bond-



related costs. We believe that it is unlikely that we will have
    to fund significant claims under our surety arrangements in the
    foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2009, the total
    amount of outstanding performance bonds was approximately
    $732.5 million, and the estimated cost to complete these
    bonded projects was approximately $177.6 million.

From time to time, we guarantee the obligations of our wholly
    owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain
    contracts with customers, certain lease obligations and, in some
    states, obligations in connection with obtaining
    contractors’ licenses. We have also guaranteed the
    obligations of our wholly owned subsidiary under the joint
    venture arrangement with a third party engineering company
    entered into in the first quarter of 2009, which is described in
    Notes 2, 11 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements.

Actual maturities of our long-term obligations may differ from
    contractual maturities because convertible note holders may
    convert their notes prior to the maturity dates or subsequent to
    optional maturity dates. Additionally, the $143.8 million
    aggregate principal amount above differs from the approximately
    $126.6 million of convertible subordinated notes on the
    consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 due to
    the balance sheet amount being presented net of a discount of
    approximately $17.2 million.

The committed capital expenditures for fiber optic networks
    represent commitments related to signed contracts with
    customers. The amounts are estimates of costs required to build
    the networks under contract. The actual capital expenditures
    related to building the networks could vary materially from
    these estimates.

As of December 31, 2009, the total unrecognized tax benefit
    related to uncertain tax positions was $45.2 million. We
    estimate that none of this will be paid within the next twelve
    months. However, we believe that it is reasonably possible that
    within the next twelve months unrecognized tax benefits will
    decrease up to $9.3 million due to the expiration of
    certain statutes of limitations. We are unable to make
    reasonably reliable estimates regarding the timing of future
    cash outflows, if any, associated with the remaining
    unrecognized tax benefits.

Our multi-employer pension plan contributions are determined
    annually based on our union employee payrolls, which cannot be
    determined in advance for future periods. We may also be
    required to make additional contributions to our multi-employer
    pension plans if they become underfunded. For further
    information, see our risk factor regarding our unionized
    operations in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

Self-Insurance

We are insured for employer’s liability, general liability,
    auto liability and workers’ compensation claims. As of
    August 1, 2009, we renewed our employer’s liability,
    general liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation
    policies for the current 2009 to 2010 policy year. As a result
    of the renewal, the deductibles for all policies have increased
    to $5.0 million per occurrence, other than employer’s
    liability, which is subject to a deductible of
    $1.0 million. Additionally, in connection with this
    renewal, the amount of letters of credit required to secure our
    obligations under our casualty insurance program, which is
    discussed above, has increased. We also have employee health
    care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective
    bargaining agreements, of which the primary



plan is subject to a deductible of $350,000 per claimant per
    year. For the policy year ended July 31, 2009,
    employer’s liability claims were subject to a deductible of
    $1.0 million per occurrence, general liability and auto
    liability claims were subject to a deductible of
    $3.0 million per occurrence, and workers’ compensation
    claims were subject to a deductible of $2.0 million per
    occurrence. Additionally, for the policy year ended
    July 31, 2009, our workers’ compensation claims were
    subject to an annual cumulative aggregate liability of up to
    $1.0 million on claims in excess of $2.0 million per
    occurrence. Our deductibles have varied in periods prior to
    August 1, 2008.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported
    and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
    assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance
    liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
    factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination
    of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of
    incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety
    program. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical
    trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate. As
    of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009, the gross
    amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $147.9 million
    and $153.6 million, with $105.0 million and
    $109.8 million considered to be long-term and included in
    other non-current liabilities. Related insurance
    recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2009 were $12.5 million and
    $33.7 million, of which $7.2 million and
    $13.4 million are included in prepaid expenses and other
    current assets and $5.3 million and $20.3 million are
    included in other assets, net.

We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and
    therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may
    change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel our
    coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or
    the cost to obtain such coverage may become unreasonable. In any
    such event, our overall risk exposure would increase which could
    negatively affect our results of operations and financial
    condition.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

We are subject to concentrations of credit risk related
    primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and accounts
    receivable. Substantially all of our cash investments are
    managed by what we believe to be high credit quality financial
    institutions. In accordance with our investment policies, these
    institutions are authorized to invest this cash in a diversified
    portfolio of what we believe to be high quality investments,
    which primarily include interest-bearing demand deposits, money
    market mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper with
    original maturities of three months or less. Although we do not
    currently believe the principal amount of these investments is
    subject to any material risk of loss, the volatility in the
    financial markets has significantly impacted the interest income
    we receive from these investments and is likely to continue to
    do so in the future. In addition, we grant credit under normal
    payment terms, generally without collateral, to our customers,
    which include electric power, natural gas and pipeline
    companies, telecommunications and cable television system
    operators, governmental entities, general contractors, and
    builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial
    properties located primarily in the United States. Consequently,
    we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in
    business and economic factors throughout the United States,
    which may be heightened as a result of ongoing economic downturn
    and volatility of the markets. However, we generally have
    certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided.
    Under certain circumstances, such as foreclosures or negotiated
    settlements, we may take title to the underlying assets in lieu
    of cash in settlement of receivables. In such circumstances,
    extended time frames may be required to liquidate these assets,
    causing the amounts realized to differ from the value of the
    assumed receivable. Historically, some of our customers have
    experienced significant financial difficulties, and others may
    experience financial difficulties in the future. These
    difficulties expose us to increased risk related to
    collectability of receivables for services we have performed. No
    customer represented 10% or more of revenues during the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2008 or 2009 or of accounts
    receivable as of December 31, 2009 or 2008.

Litigation

We are from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and
    other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These actions typically seek, among other things,
    compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract

and/or

property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
    losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all
    such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record reserves when
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. None of these proceedings,



separately or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material
    adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

Related
    Party Transactions

In the normal course of business, we enter into transactions
    from time to time with related parties. These transactions
    typically take the form of facility leases with prior owners of
    certain acquired companies and payables to prior owners who are
    now employees.

Inflation

Due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, inflation did
    not have a significant effect on our results.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements.

On
    January 1, 2009, we adopted FSP APB

14-1

(ASC 470-20),

which requires issuers of certain convertible debt instruments
    to separately account for the liability and equity components in
    a manner that adjusts the recorded value of the convertible debt
    to reflect the entity’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate
    and interest cost at the time of issuance. The value of the debt
    instrument is adjusted through a discount to the face value of
    the debt, which is amortized as non-cash interest expense over
    the expected life of the debt, with an offsetting adjustment to
    equity to separately recognize the value of the debt
    instrument’s conversion feature. FSP APB

14-1

(ASC

470-20)

has
    been applied retrospectively to all periods presented.
    Accordingly, we recorded a cumulative effect of the change in
    accounting principle to accumulated deficit as of
    January 1, 2007 of approximately $29.6 million. Also
    included in accumulated deficit is the impact from non-cash
    interest expense recorded in the amounts of approximately
    $18.3 million ($11.8 million after tax effect) and
    $14.9 million ($9.6 million after tax effect) for the
    years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008. In addition, we
    recorded non-cash interest expense during 2009 and will continue
    doing so until our 3.75% convertible subordinated notes are
    redeemable at the holders’ option in April 2013.
    Approximately $4.3 million ($2.8 million after tax
    effect) non-cash interest expense was recorded in 2009. See the
    tables in Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements
    for the impact of FSP APB

14-1

(ASC

470-20)

as
    of December 31, 2008 and for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2008.

On January 1, 2009, we adopted FSP

EITF 03-6-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities” (ASC
    260,

Earnings Per Share

). FSP

EITF 03-6-1

(ASC 260) states that unvested share-based payment
    awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or
    dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating
    securities and should be included in the computation of both
    basic and diluted earnings per share. All prior period earnings
    per share data presented have been adjusted retrospectively to
    conform to the provisions of FSP

EITF 03-6-1

(ASC 260). All of our restricted stock grants have
    non-forfeitable rights to dividends and are considered
    participating securities under FSP

EITF 03-6-1

(ASC 260). Prior to the retrospective application of FSP

EITF 03-6-1

(ASC 260) on January 1, 2009, unvested restricted
    stock grants were included in the calculation of weighted
    average dilutive shares outstanding using the treasury stock
    method. Under this previous method, unvested restricted common
    shares were not included in the calculation of weighted average
    basic shares outstanding but were included in the calculation of
    weighted average diluted shares outstanding to the extent the
    grant price was less than the average share price for the
    respective period. The impact of the retrospective application
    of FSP

EITF 03-6-1

(ASC 260) on earnings per share for prior periods is
    immaterial. Additionally, the adoption of FSP

EITF 03-6-1

(ASC 260) had no material impact on basic and diluted
    income per share in the year ended December 31, 2009. See
    Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the
    impact of adopting FSP

EITF 03-6-1

(ASC 260) for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2008.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 141(R)-1,
    “Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in
    a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies” (ASC
    805,

Business Combinations

). FSP FAS 141(R)-1 (ASC
    805) amends the provisions related to the initial
    recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and
    disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies
    in a business combination under SFAS No. 141(R) (ASC
    805) and has the same effective date as
    SFAS No. 141(R) (ASC 805). Accordingly, we adopted FSP



FAS 141(R)-1 (ASC 805) effective January 1, 2009.
    FSP FAS 141(R)-1 (ASC 805) carries forward the
    requirements in SFAS No. 141, “Business
    Combinations,” which is now superseded, for acquired
    contingencies, which requires that such contingencies be
    recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value
    can be reasonably estimated during the measurement period.
    Otherwise, companies should typically account for the acquired
    contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
    “Accounting for Contingencies” (ASC 450,

Contingencies

). FSP FAS 141(R)-1
    (ASC 805) also amends the disclosure requirements of
    SFAS No. 141(R) (ASC 805) to require separate
    disclosure of recognized and unrecognized contingencies if
    certain conditions are met. We have applied the provisions of
    this ASC for business combinations with an acquisition date on
    or after January 1, 2009.

On January 1, 2009, we fully adopted
    SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (ASC
    820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

).
    SFAS No. 157 (ASC 820) defines fair value,
    establishes methods used to measure fair value and expands
    disclosure requirements about fair value measurements with
    respect to financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
    The adoption of SFAS No. 157 (ASC 820) did not
    have a material impact on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations, cash flows or disclosures. In April 2009,
    the FASB issued FSP

FAS 157-4,

“Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of
    Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased
    and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly” (ASC

820-10-35-51),

which provides additional guidance for estimating fair value
    when an entity determines that either the volume

and/or

level
    of activity for an asset or liability has significantly
    decreased. FSP

FAS 157-4

(ASC

820-10-35-51)

also provides guidance to identify circumstances that indicate
    when a transaction is not orderly. FSP

FAS 157-4

(ASC

820-10-35-51)

is effective for interim and annual periods ending after
    June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted in certain
    circumstances for periods ending after March 15, 2009. We
    adopted FSP

FAS 157-4

(ASC

820-10-35-51)

in the quarter ended March 31, 2009. The adoption of FSP

FAS 157-4

(ASC

820-10-35-51)

did not have any material impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

During the quarter ended March 31, 2009, we adopted FSP

FAS 107-1

and APB

28-1,

“Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments” (ASC

825-10-65,

Financial Instruments — Overall —
    Transition

). FSP

FAS 107-1

(ASC

825-10-65)

requires public entities to provide the disclosures required by
    SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of
    Financial Instruments” (ASC 825,

Financial
    Instruments

) on a quarterly basis and is effective for
    interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009, with
    early adoption permitted in certain circumstances for periods
    ending after March 15, 2009. Because we have been providing
    these disclosures in our quarterly reports prior to the issuance
    of FSP

FAS 107-1

(ASC

825-10-65),

the adoption of FSP

FAS 107-1

(ASC 825-10-65)

did not have any material impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

During the quarter ended March 31, 2009, we adopted FSP

FAS 115-2

and

FAS 124-2,

“Recognition and Presentation of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairments” (ASC

320-10-65-1,

Investment — Debt and Equity Securities —
    Overall — Transition

). FSP

FAS 115-2

(ASC

320-10-65-1)

establishes a new method of recognizing and reporting

other-than-temporary

impairments of debt securities. FSP

FAS 115-2

(ASC

320-10-65-1)

also contains additional disclosure requirements related to debt
    and equity securities. FSP

FAS 115-2

(ASC

320-10-65-1)

is effective for interim and annual periods ending after
    June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted in certain
    circumstances for periods ending after March 15, 2009.
    Because we have not held any debt or equity securities that
    would be within the scope of FSP

FAS 115-2

(ASC

320-10-65-1)

since its adoption, the adoption of FSP

FAS 115-2

(ASC

320-10-65-1)

did not have any material impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

In June 2009 and February 2010, we adopted
    SFAS No. 165, “Subsequent Events” (ASC 855,

Subsequent Events

). Although SFAS No. 165 (ASC
    855) should not result in significant changes in the
    subsequent events an entity reports, it requires enhanced
    disclosures related to subsequent events including the date
    through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events.
    SFAS No. 165 (ASC 855) is effective for interim
    and annual financial statements ending after June 15, 2009
    and must be applied prospectively. In February 2010, the FASB
    amended this guidance to remove the requirement to include the
    date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events.

On July 1, 2009, we adopted ASC 105,

Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles

. ASC 105 establishes the FASB
    Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the source
    of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to
    be used by non-governmental entities in the preparation of
    financial statements



presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States (GAAP). Rules and
    interpretations of the SEC under the authority of federal
    securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC
    registrants such as us. On July 1, 2009, the Codification
    reorganized the pre-Codification GAAP into approximately 90
    accounting topics and superseded all then-existing non-SEC
    accounting and reporting standards. All accounting literature
    not included in the Codification became non-authoritative. All
    of the Codification’s content carries the same level of
    authority, which effectively superseded SFAS No. 162.
    ASC 105 is effective for financial statements for interim or
    annual periods ending after September 15, 2009.
    Accordingly, we adopted ASC 105 on July 1, 2009. The
    adoption of ASC 105 did not have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows but resulted in changes to the references to accounting
    principles in our notes to the consolidated financial statements
    and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.

Accounting
    Standards Not Yet Adopted.

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166,
    “Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets —
    an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140” (ASC 860,

Transfers and

Servicing) and SFAS No. 167,
    “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an amendment
    to FIN 46(R)” (ASC 810,

Consolidations

)
    Together these new standards aim to improve the visibility of
    off-balance sheet vehicles currently exempt from consolidation
    and address practice issues involving the accounting for
    transfers of financial assets as sales or secured borrowings.
    These new standards are effective as of the beginning of an
    entity’s fiscal year beginning after November 15,
    2009, and for interim periods within that first year, with
    earlier adoption prohibited. Accordingly, we adopted
    SFAS Nos. 166 (ASC 860) and 167 (ASC 810) on
    January 1, 2010. We believe the impact, if any, from the
    adoption of SFAS Nos. 166 (ASC 860) and 167
    (ASC 810) will not be material.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
    results of operations are based on our consolidated financial
    statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
    The preparation of these consolidated financial statements
    requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of
    contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date
    the consolidated financial statements are published and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the
    periods presented. We review all significant estimates affecting
    our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and
    record the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their
    publication. Judgments and estimates are based on our beliefs
    and assumptions derived from information available at the time
    such judgments and estimates are made. Uncertainties with
    respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the
    preparation of financial statements. There can be no assurance
    that actual results will not differ from those estimates.
    Management has reviewed its development and selection of
    critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our
    Board of Directors. We believe the following accounting policies
    affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the
    preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

Revenue
    Recognition

Infrastructure Services

— Through our Electric
    Power Infrastructure Services, Natural Gas and Pipeline
    Infrastructure Services and Telecommunications Infrastructure
    Services segments, we design, install and maintain networks for
    the electric power, natural gas and oil, telecommunications and
    cable television industries. These services may be provided
    pursuant to master service agreements, repair and maintenance
    contracts and fixed price and non-fixed price installation
    contracts. Pricing under these contracts may be competitive unit
    price, cost-plus/hourly (or time and materials basis) or fixed
    price (or lump sum basis), and the final terms and prices of
    these contracts are frequently negotiated with the customer.
    Under unit-based contracts, the utilization of an output-based
    measurement is appropriate for revenue recognition. Under these
    contracts, we recognize revenue as units are completed based on
    pricing established between us and the customer for each unit of
    delivery, which best reflects the pattern in which the
    obligation to the customer is fulfilled. Under our
    cost-plus/hourly and time and materials type contracts, we
    recognize revenue on an input basis, as labor hours are incurred
    and services are performed.



Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to
    total estimated costs for each contract. These contracts provide
    for a fixed amount of revenues for the entire project. Such
    contracts provide that the customer accept completion of
    progress to date and compensate us for services rendered,
    measured in terms of units installed, hours expended or some
    other measure of progress. Contract costs include all direct
    materials, labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs
    related to contract performance, such as indirect labor,
    supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Much of the
    materials associated with our work are owner-furnished and are
    therefore not included in contract revenues and costs. The cost
    estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and
    experience of our engineers, project managers and financial
    professionals. Changes in job performance, job conditions and
    final contract settlements are factors that influence
    management’s assessment of the total estimated costs to
    complete those contracts and therefore, our profit recognition.
    Changes in these factors are periodically reviewed and may
    result in revisions to costs and income and their effects are
    recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.
    Provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the
    period in which such losses are determined to be probable and
    the amount can be reasonably estimated. If actual results
    significantly differ from our estimates used for revenue
    recognition and claim assessments, our financial condition and
    results of operations could be materially impacted.

We may incur costs related to change orders, whether approved or
    unapproved by the customer,

and/or

claims related to certain contracts. We determine the
    probability that such costs will be recovered based upon
    evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific
    discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer or
    verbal approvals. We treat items as a cost of contract
    performance in the period incurred if it is not probable that
    the costs will be recovered or will recognize revenue if it is
    probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be
    reliably estimated.

The current asset “Costs and estimated earnings in excess
    of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents revenues
    recognized in excess of amounts billed for fixed price
    contracts. The current liability “Billings in excess of
    costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts”
    represents billings in excess of revenues recognized for fixed
    price contracts.

Fiber Optic Licensing

— The Fiber Optic
    Licensing segment constructs and licenses the right to use fiber
    optic telecommunications facilities to its customers pursuant to
    licensing agreements, typically with terms from five to
    twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal options. Under
    those agreements, customers are provided the right to use a
    portion of the capacity of a fiber optic facility, with the
    facility owned and maintained by us. Revenues, including any
    initial fees or advance billings, are recognized ratably over
    the expected length of the agreements, including probable
    renewal periods. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, initial
    fees and advanced billings on these licensing agreements not yet
    recorded in revenue were $34.6 million and
    $35.9 million and are recognized as deferred revenue, with
    $25.1 million and $25.4 million considered to be
    long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Actual
    revenues may differ from those estimates if the contracts are
    not renewed as expected.

Self-Insurance.

We are insured for
    employer’s liability, general liability, auto liability and
    workers’ compensation claims. As of August 1, 2009, we
    renewed our employer’s liability, general liability, auto
    liability and workers’ compensation policies for the
    current 2009 to 2010 policy year. As a result of the renewal,
    the deductibles for all policies have increased to
    $5.0 million per occurrence, other than employer’s
    liability which is subject to a deductible of $1.0 million.
    Additionally, in connection with this renewal, the amount of
    letters of credit required by us to secure our obligations under
    our casualty insurance program, which is discussed further
    below, has increased. We also have employee health care benefit
    plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining
    agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible
    of $350,000 per claimant per year. For policy year ended
    July 31, 2009, employer’s liability claims were
    subject to a deductible of $1.0 million per occurrence,
    general liability and auto liability claims were subject to a
    deductible of $3.0 million per occurrence, and
    workers’ compensation claims were subject to a deductible
    of $2.0 million per occurrence. Additionally, for the
    policy year ended July 31, 2009, our workers’
    compensation claims were subject to an annual cumulative
    aggregate liability of up to $1.0 million on claims in
    excess of $2.0 million per occurrence. Our deductibles have
    varied in periods prior to August 1, 2008.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported
    and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
    assistance from third-party actuaries.



These insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate
    due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the
    determination of our liability in proportion to other parties,
    the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of
    our safety program. The accruals are based upon known facts and
    historical trends and management believes such accruals to be
    adequate. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, the gross
    amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $147.9 million
    and $153.6 million, with $105.0 million and
    $109.8 million considered to be long-term and included in
    other non-current liabilities. Related insurance
    recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2008 and 2009
    were $12.5 million and $33.7 million, of which
    $7.2 million and $13.4 million are included in prepaid
    expenses and other current assets and $5.3 million and
    $20.3 million are included in other assets, net.

We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and
    therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may
    change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel our
    coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or
    the cost to obtain such coverage may become unreasonable. In any
    such event, our overall risk exposure would increase, which
    could cause an increase in the liabilities we bear.

Valuation of Goodwill.

We have recorded
    goodwill in connection with various of our acquisitions.
    Goodwill is subject to an annual assessment for impairment using
    a two-step fair value-based test, which we perform at the
    operating unit level. We have determined that, based on our cash
    flow structure and organizational structure, our individual
    operating units represent our reporting units for the purpose of
    assessing goodwill impairments. This assessment is performed
    annually at year-end, or more frequently if events or
    circumstances exist which indicate that goodwill may be
    impaired. For instance, a decrease in our market capitalization
    below book value, a significant change in business climate or a
    loss of a significant customer, among other things, may trigger
    the need for interim impairment testing of goodwill associated
    with one or all of our reporting units. The first step of the
    two-step fair value-based test involves comparing the fair value
    of each of our reporting units with its carrying value,
    including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit
    exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second
    step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill. If the
    implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount,
    an impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction to goodwill
    with a corresponding charge to operating expense.

We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a
    weighted combination of the discounted cash flow, market
    multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches, with
    heavier weighting on the discounted cash flow method, as in
    management’s opinion, this method currently results in the
    most accurate calculation of a reporting unit’s fair value.
    Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment
    and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such
    estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates,
    operating margins, discount rates, weighted average costs of
    capital and future market conditions, among others. We believe
    that the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment
    assessments are reasonable and based on available market
    information, but variations in any of the assumptions could
    result in materially different calculations of fair value and
    determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated.

Under the discounted cash flow method, we determine fair value
    based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit,
    discounted to present value using risk-adjusted industry
    discount rates, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk
    of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor
    would expect to earn. Cash flow projections are derived from
    budgeted amounts and operating forecasts (typically a three-year
    model) plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which
    are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are
    developed for each reporting unit using growth rates that
    management believes are reasonably likely to occur along with a
    terminal value derived from the reporting unit’s earnings
    before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
    The EBITDA multiples for each reporting unit are based on
    trailing twelve-month comparable industry data.

Under the market multiple and market capitalization approaches,
    we determine the estimated fair value of each of our reporting
    units by applying transaction multiples to each reporting
    unit’s projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate
    with similar historical calculations using either a one or two
    year average. For the market capitalization approach, we add a
    reasonable control premium, which is estimated as the premium
    that would be received in a sale of the reporting unit in an
    orderly transaction between market participants.



The projected cash flows and estimated levels of EBITDA by
    reporting unit were used to determine fair value under the three
    approaches discussed herein. The following table presents the
    significant estimates used by management in determining the fair
    values of our reporting units at December 31, 2007, 2008
    and 2009:

Quanta’s operations remain structured on an operating unit
    basis, with each operating unit being organized into one of
    three internal divisions, which are closely aligned with its
    operating segments and are based on the predominant type of work
    performed by the operating unit at the point in time when the
    divisional designation is made. The changes in our reportable
    segments during the quarters ended June 30, 2009 and
    September 30, 2009 did not have any impact on our operating
    unit structure. Because separate measures of assets and cash
    flows are not produced or utilized by management to evaluate
    segment performance, Quanta’s impairment assessments of its
    goodwill do not include any considerations of cash flows by its
    reportable segments.

During 2007, 2008 and 2009, a goodwill analysis was performed
    for each operating unit with estimates and industry comparables
    obtained from the electric power, natural gas and pipeline,
    telecommunications and fiber optic licensing industries. At
    December 31, 2007, we did not perform a separate goodwill
    impairment analysis for the operating unit that provides fiber
    optic licensing as we had recently acquired this operating unit
    on August 30, 2007 in connection with our acquisition of
    InfraSource Services, Inc., and goodwill associated with that
    transaction was assessed in the aggregate. The

15-year

discounted cash flow model used for fiber optic licensing was
    based on the long-term nature of the underlying fiber network
    licensing agreements.

We assigned a higher weighting to the discounted cash flow
    approach during each year to reflect increased expectations of
    market value being determined from a “held and used”
    model. At December 31, 2008 and 2009, we increased the
    weighting for the discounted cash flow approach as compared to
    December 31, 2007 due to the continued volatility of the
    capital markets at the end of 2008 and 2009 and the impact such
    volatility may have had on the accuracy of the market multiple
    and market capitalization approaches. Also at December 31,
    2008, we increased some discount rates and decreased EBITDA
    multiples at reporting units to reflect potential declines in
    market conditions. At December 31, 2009, we further
    decreased EBITDA multiples at operating units to reflect
    potential declines in market conditions in light of the
    continued economic recession.

As stated previously, cash flows are derived from budgeted
    amounts and operating forecasts which have been evaluated by
    management. In connection with the 2009 assessment, projected
    growth rates by reporting unit varied widely with ranges from 0%
    to 20% for operating units in the electric power and the natural
    gas and pipeline divisions, 0% to 25% for operating units in
    telecommunications and 9% to 28% for the operating unit in fiber
    optic licensing.

Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and
    our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized.
    Changes in our judgments and projections could result in a
    significantly different estimate of the fair value of reporting
    units and intangible assets and could result in an impairment.
    Variances in the assessment of market conditions, projected cash
    flows, cost of capital, growth rates and acquisition multiples
    applied could have an impact on the assessment of impairments
    and any amount of goodwill impairment charges recorded. For
    example, lower growth rates, lower acquisition multiples or
    higher costs of capital assumptions would all individually lead
    to lower fair value assessments and potentially increased
    frequency or size of goodwill



impairments. Any goodwill or other intangible impairment would
    be included in the consolidated statements of operations.

Based on the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis, we
    determined that, as of December 31, 2009, the fair value of
    each reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value. We
    considered the sensitivity of these fair value estimates to
    changes in certain of management’s assumptions, noting
    that, after giving consideration to at least a 10% decrease in
    the fair value of each of our reporting units, the results of
    our assessment would not have changed. Additionally, we compared
    the sum of fair values of our reporting units to our market
    capitalization at December 31, 2009 and determined that the
    excess of the aggregate fair value of all reporting units to our
    market capitalization reflected a reasonable control premium.
    Further, our market capitalization at December 31, 2009 was
    approximately $4.3 billion, and our carrying value,
    including goodwill, was approximately $3.1 billion.
    Accordingly, we determined that there was no goodwill impairment
    at December 31, 2009. Increases in the carrying value of
    individual reporting units that may be indicated by our
    impairment tests are not recorded, therefore we may record
    goodwill impairments in the future, even when the aggregate fair
    value of our reporting units as a whole may increase.

We recognize that we and our customers are operating in a
    challenging business environment in light of the economic
    downturn and weak capital markets. We are closely monitoring our
    customers and the effect that changes in economic and market
    conditions may have on them and therefore our reporting units.
    Certain of our customers, in particular our electric power,
    telecommunications and natural gas and pipeline customers, have
    reduced spending in 2009, which we attribute to the negative
    economic and market conditions, and we anticipate that these
    negative conditions may continue to affect demand for some of
    our services in the near-term. We continue to monitor the impact
    of the economic environment on our reporting units and the
    valuation of recorded goodwill. Although we are not aware of
    circumstances that would lead to a goodwill impairment at a
    reporting unit currently, circumstances such as a continued
    market decline, the loss of a major customer or other factors
    could impact the valuation of goodwill in the future.

Our goodwill is included in multiple reporting units. Due to the
    cyclical nature of our business, and the other factors described
    under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A, the
    profitability of our individual reporting units may suffer from
    downturns in customer demand and other factors. These factors
    may have a disproportionate impact on the individual reporting
    units as compared to Quanta as a whole and might adversely
    affect the fair value of the individual reporting units. If
    material adverse conditions occur that impact our reporting
    units, our future estimates of fair value may not support the
    carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units, and the
    related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount
    considered recoverable.

Valuation of Other Intangibles.

Other
    intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not
    amortized but, instead, must be tested at least annually for
    impairment in a manner similar to that described above for
    goodwill. We currently do not have any other intangible assets
    with indefinite useful lives. However, we do have other
    intangible assets with definite lives. Our intangible assets
    include customer relationships, trade names, backlog,
    non-compete agreements and patented rights and developed
    technology. The value of customer relationships is estimated
    using the

value-in-use

concept utilizing the income approach, specifically the excess
    earnings method. The excess earnings analysis consists of
    discounting to present value the projected cash flows
    attributable to the customer relationships, with consideration
    given to customer contract renewals, the importance or lack
    thereof of existing customer relationships to our business plan,
    income taxes and required rates of return. We value backlog
    based upon the contractual nature of the backlog within each
    service line, using the income approach to discount back to
    present value the cash flows attributable to the backlog.

We amortize intangible assets based upon the estimated
    consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset or
    on a straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits
    consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated. Intangible
    assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment and
    are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
    recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying
    amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its
    carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets.

We review
    long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
    realizable. If an evaluation is required, the estimated



future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are
    compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if an
    impairment of such asset is necessary. This requires us to make
    long-term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to
    the assets subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions
    about demand for our products and future market conditions.
    Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and
    our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized.
    Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could
    require a provision for impairment in a future period. The
    effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference
    between the fair value of such asset and its carrying value.
    Such expense would be reflected in income (loss) from operations
    in the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, we
    estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets and other
    intangibles and periodically review these estimates to determine
    whether these lives are appropriate.

Current and Non-Current Accounts and Notes Receivable and
    Provision for Doubtful Accounts.

We provide an
    allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account or
    note receivable is considered doubtful, and receivables are
    written off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible.
    Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful
    accounts are certain judgments and estimates including, among
    others, our customer’s access to capital, our
    customer’s willingness or ability to pay, general economic
    and market conditions and the ongoing relationship with the
    customer. Under certain circumstances such as foreclosures or
    negotiated settlements, we may take title to the underlying
    assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. Material
    changes in our customers’ cash flows, which may be further
    impacted by the current financial crisis and volatility of the
    markets, could affect our ability to collect amounts due from
    them. Should customers experience financial difficulties or file
    for bankruptcy, or should anticipated recoveries relating to the
    receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations
    fail to materialize, we could experience reduced cash flows and
    losses in excess of current allowances provided.

Income Taxes.

We follow the liability method
    of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences
    of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax
    bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the
    enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect
    when the underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or
    settled.

We regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for
    deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain.
    The estimation of required valuation allowances includes
    estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of
    deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
    taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
    differences become deductible. We consider projected future
    taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
    assessment. If actual future taxable income differs from our
    estimates, we may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent
    estimated.

We record reserves for expected tax consequences of uncertain
    tax positions assuming that the taxing authorities have full
    knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The income tax
    laws and regulations are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As
    such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and
    judgments regarding our tax positions that can materially affect
    amounts recognized in our future consolidated balance sheets and
    statements of operations.

Outlook

We and our customers are operating in a challenging business
    environment in light of the economic downturn and weak capital
    markets. As a result, many of our customers reduced spending in
    2009, negatively impacting our revenues throughout the year.
    While we believe that economic conditions may begin to improve
    in the next six months and create increased demand for our
    services in the second half of 2010, we anticipate that the
    first quarter of 2010 will be challenging. We continue to be
    optimistic about our long-term opportunities in each of the
    industries we serve, and we believe that our financial and
    operational strengths will enable us to manage the challenges
    and uncertainties created by the adverse economic and market
    conditions.

Electric
    Power Infrastructure Services Segment

The North American electric grid is aging and requires
    significant upgrades to meet future demands for power. Over the
    past two years, many utilities across the country have begun to
    implement plans to improve their transmission and distribution
    systems, with a more significant focus on the upgrade and
    build-out of the



transmission grid. As a result, new construction, structure
    change-outs, line upgrades and maintenance projects on many
    transmission systems are occurring or planned. We have seen a
    slowdown in spending by our customers on their distribution
    systems, which we believe is due primarily to adverse economic
    and market conditions, and we expect distribution spending to
    remain slow during 2010. We believe, however, that utilities
    remain committed to the expansion and strengthening of their
    transmission infrastructure, and we do not expect significant
    delays in most of the large transmission projects. We also
    anticipate that utilities will continue to integrate “smart
    grid” technologies into their transmission and distribution
    systems to improve grid management and create efficiencies.
    However, if economic and market conditions remain stagnant or
    worsen, spending on these projects could be negatively affected
    as well. Additionally, as an indirect result of the economic
    downturn, overall demand for electricity has decreased, which
    could affect the timing and scope of transmission and
    distribution spending by our customers on their existing systems
    or planned projects. However, demand for electricity is expected
    to increase over the long-term, which we believe will result in
    increased spending and more demand for our services in the
    future.

Several existing or pending legislative or regulatory actions,
    as well as renewable energy initiatives, may affect demand for
    the services provided by this segment. For example, the American
    Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES Act), which was approved by
    the House of Representatives in June 2009 and is being reviewed
    by the Senate, could positively impact electric power
    infrastructure spending in the long-term. If enacted as
    proposed, the ACES Act could alleviate some of the siting and

right-of-way

challenges that impact transmission projects, potentially
    accelerating future transmission projects. A recent alliance
    among nine federal agencies, including the Environmental
    Protection Agency, the Department of Energy and the Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission, is also intended to simplify and
    streamline the siting and approval process for building new
    transmission lines on federal lands. We also anticipate
    increased infrastructure spending as a result of the Energy
    Policy Act of 2005, which requires the power industry to meet
    federal reliability standards for its transmission and
    distribution systems and provides further incentives to the
    industry to invest in and improve maintenance on its systems. In
    addition, we expect the construction of renewable energy
    facilities, including wind and solar power generation sources,
    to result in the need for additional transmission lines and
    substations. As a result of these and other factors, we expect a
    continued shift over the long-term in our electric power service
    mix to a greater proportion of high-voltage electric power
    transmission and substation projects, as well as opportunities
    to provide installation services for renewable projects. Many of
    these projects have a long-term horizon, and timing and scope
    can be negatively affected by numerous factors, including
    regulatory permitting, availability of funding and the effect of
    adverse economic and market conditions and final legislation.

We believe that opportunities also exist for us to provide
    engineering, project management and installation services for
    renewable projects, including wind and solar. State renewable
    portfolio standards, which set required or voluntary standards
    for how much power is required to be generated from renewable
    energy sources, as well as general environmental concerns, are
    driving the development of renewable energy projects, with a
    stronger focus currently on utility-scale and distributed solar
    projects. Tax incentives and government stimulus funds are also
    expected to encourage development. Additionally, the pending
    ACES Act includes a proposed federal renewable portfolio
    standard that we expect could further advance the installation
    of renewable generation facilities. While overall renewable
    energy spending has declined since the latter part of 2008, due
    in part to slow government funding and tight credit markets, we
    saw some increased spending in the fourth quarter of 2009 and we
    expect future spending on renewable energy initiatives to
    increase in 2010 and beyond, although investments could be
    affected by further government funding delays, as well as
    capital constraints if the financial markets worsen or remain
    stagnant. It is also not certain when or if the ACES Act and
    other proposed legislation will be enacted or whether the
    potentially beneficial provisions we highlight in this outlook
    will be included in the final legislation.

We believe that certain provisions of the American Recovery and
    Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), enacted in February 2009, will
    also increase demand for our services over the long-term. The
    economic stimulus programs under the ARRA include incentives in
    the form of grants, loans, tax cuts and tax credits for
    renewable energy, energy efficiency and electric power and
    telecommunications infrastructure. For example, the ARRA
    extended tax credits for wind projects until 2012, which we
    expect will encourage further development in wind energy.
    Additionally, loan guarantee programs partially funded through
    the ARRA and cash grant programs have recently been implemented
    for renewable energy and transmission reliability and efficiency
    projects. For example, in October 2009, approximately



$3.4 billion in cash grants were awarded to foster the
    transition to a “smarter” electric grid. Funds
    provided to the states for the restoration, repair and
    construction of highways will also likely require the relocation
    and upgrade of electric power, telecommunications and natural
    gas infrastructure. We anticipate investments in many of these
    initiatives to create opportunities for our operations, although
    many projects are awaiting government funding. We also cannot
    predict with certainty the timing of the implementation of the
    programs that support these investments or the timing or scope
    of the investments once the programs are implemented.

Several industry and market trends are also prompting customers
    in the electric power industry to seek outsourcing partners.
    These trends include an aging utility workforce, increasing
    costs and labor issues. The need to ensure available labor
    resources for larger projects is also driving strategic
    relationships with customers.

Natural
    Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services Segment

We also see potential growth opportunities over the long-term in
    our natural gas operations, primarily in natural gas pipeline
    installation and maintenance and related services such as gas
    gathering and pipeline integrity. We believe our recent
    acquisition of Price Gregory, which significantly expands our
    natural gas services and positions us as a leading provider of
    transmission pipeline infrastructure services in North America,
    will allow us to take advantage of these opportunities. However,
    the natural gas industry is cyclical as a result of fluctuations
    in natural gas prices, and over the past twelve months, spending
    in this industry has been negatively impacted by lower natural
    gas prices, a reduction in the development of natural gas
    resources and capital constraints. We believe that the cyclical
    nature of this business can be somewhat normalized by
    opportunities associated with an increase in the on-going
    development of gas shale formations, which will require the
    construction of transmission infrastructure to connect
    production with demand centers. Additionally, we believe the
    goals of clean energy and energy independence for the United
    States will make abundant, low-cost natural gas the fuel of
    choice to replace coal for power generation until renewable
    energy becomes a significant part of the overall generation of
    electricity, creating the demand for additional production of
    natural gas and the need for related infrastructure. In the
    past, our natural gas operations have been challenged by lower
    margins overall, due in part to our natural gas distribution
    services that have been impacted by certain lower margin
    contracts and by declines in new housing construction. As a
    result, as evidenced by our acquisition of Price Gregory, we
    have primarily focused our efforts on natural gas transmission
    opportunities and other more profitable services, and we are
    optimistic about these operations in the future. However, we
    expect economic and market conditions as well as lower natural
    gas prices to continue to adversely affect this business in the
    near-term.

Telecommunications
    Infrastructure Services Segment

In connection with our telecommunications services, we believe
    opportunities exist as a result of various initiatives on-going
    by several wireline carriers and government organizations with
    respect to deployment of fiber to the premises (FTTP) and fiber
    to the node (FTTN). Such initiatives have been underway by
    Verizon and AT&T since 2007. In addition, other
    telecommunications providers and municipalities and other
    government jurisdictions are also active in these opportunities.
    Since the second quarter of 2008, however, we have experienced a
    decline in revenues from our telecommunications services,
    primarily as a result of the significant slowdown in FTTP and
    FTTN deployment. We expect future opportunities from certain
    rural broadband deployment projects to underserved and unserved
    areas, as stimulus funding for these projects will likely be
    awarded starting in 2010 to municipalities, states and rural
    telephone companies, some of which are long-standing customers.
    As a result of these factors, we expect spending on FTTP and
    FTTN and other broadband deployment to improve in 2010, although
    if economic and market conditions remain stagnant or further
    deteriorate, this spending could be further delayed. In
    connection with our wireless services, several wireless
    companies have announced plans to increase their cell site
    deployments over the next few years, including the expansion of
    next generation technology. In particular, the transition to 4G
    technology by wireless service providers will require the
    enhancement of their networks. We also anticipate spending by
    our customers on fiber optic “backhaul” to provide
    links from wireless cell sites to broader voice, data and video
    networks. We expect increased opportunities from these various
    plans over the long-term, with the timing and amount of spending
    on these plans somewhat dependent on future economic and market
    conditions.



We anticipate that the future initiatives by the
    telecommunication carriers will serve as a catalyst for the
    cable industry to begin a new network upgrade cycle to expand
    its service offerings in an effort to retain and attract
    customers; however, the timing of any upgrades is uncertain.

Fiber
    Optic Licensing Segment

Our Fiber Optic Licensing segment is experiencing growth
    primarily through geographic expansion, with a focus on markets
    such as education and healthcare where secure high-speed
    networks are important. We continue to see opportunities for
    growth both in the markets we currently serve and new markets,
    although we cannot predict the adverse impact, if any, of the
    ongoing economic downturn on these growth opportunities. To
    support the growth in this business, we anticipate the need for
    continued significant capital expenditures. Our Fiber Optic
    Licensing segment typically generates higher margins than our
    other operations, but we can give no assurance that the Fiber
    Optic Licensing segment margins will continue at historical
    levels.

Conclusion

Spending by our customers declined in 2009, resulting in an
    overall reduction in our 2009 revenues. While our customers have
    historically continued to spend throughout short-term economic
    softness or weak recessions, the longer-term recession we are
    experiencing has had an adverse impact on our customers’
    spending. In addition, the volatility of the capital markets has
    negatively affected some of our customers’ plans for
    projects, and it may continue to do so in the future, which
    could delay, reduce or suspend future projects if funding is not
    available. It is uncertain when and to what extent the current
    unfavorable economic and market conditions will improve, or if
    they will deteriorate further. Despite reductions in capital
    spending by some of our customers, our revenues in certain of
    the industries we serve may not continue to decline
    significantly, as we anticipate that utilities will continue
    spending on projects to upgrade and build out their transmission
    systems and continue outsourcing more of their work, in part due
    to their aging workforce issues. We believe that we remain the
    partner of choice for many utilities in need of broad
    infrastructure expertise, specialty equipment and workforce
    resources. We also believe that, through the acquisition of
    Price Gregory, we are one of the largest full-service solution
    providers of natural gas transmission and distribution services
    in North America, which positions us to leverage opportunities
    in the natural gas industry. Furthermore, as new technologies
    emerge in the future for communications and digital services
    such as voice, video and data, telecommunications and cable
    service providers are expected to work quickly to deploy fast,
    next-generation fiber and wireless networks, and we are
    recognized as a key partner in deploying these services.

With the growth in several of our markets and our margin
    enhancement initiatives, we expect to continue to see our gross
    margins generally improve over the long-term, although
    reductions in spending by our customers could further negatively
    affect our margins, with the most significant impact to our
    telecommunications operations and natural gas and electric power
    distribution services. Additionally, gross margins may be
    negatively impacted on a quarterly basis due to adverse weather
    conditions and other factors as described in

“Understanding Margins”

above. We continue to
    focus on the elements of the business we can control, including
    costs, the margins we accept on projects, collecting
    receivables, ensuring quality service and rightsizing
    initiatives to match the markets we serve. These initiatives
    include aligning our workforce with our current revenue base,
    evaluating opportunities to reduce the number of field offices
    and evaluating our non-core assets for potential sale. Such
    initiatives could result in future charges related to, among
    other things, severance, retention, the shutdown and
    consolidation of facilities, property disposal and other exit
    costs.

Capital expenditures for 2010 are expected to be approximately
    $215 million, of which approximately $70 million of
    these expenditures are targeted for fiber optic network
    expansion with the majority of the remaining expenditures for
    operating equipment. We expect 2010 capital expenditures to
    continue to be funded substantially through internal cash flows
    and cash on hand.

We continue to evaluate other potential strategic acquisitions
    or investments to broaden our customer base, expand our
    geographic area of operation and grow our portfolio of services.
    We believe that additional attractive acquisition candidates
    exist primarily as a result of the highly fragmented nature of
    the industry, the inability of many companies to expand and
    modernize due to capital constraints and the desire of owners
    for liquidity. We also believe that our financial strength and
    experienced management team will be attractive to acquisition
    candidates.



We believe that we are adequately positioned to capitalize upon
    opportunities and trends in the industries we serve because of
    our proven full-service operating units with broad geographic
    reach, financial capability and technical expertise.
    Additionally, we believe that these industry opportunities and
    trends will increase the demand for our services over the
    long-term; however, we cannot predict the actual timing,
    magnitude or impact these opportunities and trends will have on
    our operating results and financial position, especially in
    light of the economic downturn and weak capital markets.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our primary exposure to market risk relates to unfavorable
    changes in concentration of credit risk, interest rates and
    currency exchange rates.

Credit Risk.

We are subject to concentrations
    of credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalents and
    accounts receivable. Substantially all of our cash investments
    are managed by what we believe to be high credit quality
    financial institutions. In accordance with our investment
    policies, these institutions are authorized to invest this cash
    in a diversified portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality
    investments, which primarily include interest-bearing demand
    deposits, money market mutual funds and investment grade
    commercial paper with original maturities of three months or
    less. Although we do not currently believe the principal amounts
    of these investments are subject to any material risk of loss,
    the recent volatility in the financial markets is likely to
    continue to have a significant negative impact on the interest
    income we receive from these investments. In addition, as we
    grant credit under normal payment terms, generally with
    collateral, we are subject to potential credit risk related to
    our customers’ ability to pay for services provided. This
    risk may be heightened as a result of the current financial
    crisis and volatility of the markets. However, we believe the
    concentration of credit risk related to trade accounts
    receivable is limited because of the diversity of our customers.
    We perform ongoing credit risk assessments of our customers and
    financial institutions and obtain collateral or other security
    from our customers when appropriate.

Interest Rate and Market Risk.

Our exposure to
    interest rate and market risk for changes in interest rates
    relates to our convertible subordinated notes. The fair market
    value of our fixed rate convertible subordinated notes is
    subject to interest rate risk because of their fixed interest
    rate and market risk due to the convertible feature of our
    convertible subordinated notes. Generally, the fair market value
    of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall
    and decrease as interest rates rise. The fair market value of
    our convertible subordinated notes will also increase as the
    market price of our stock rises and decrease as the market price
    falls. The interest and market value changes affect the fair
    market value of our convertible subordinated notes but do not
    impact their carrying value. As of December 31, 2008 and
    2009, the fair value of the aggregate principal amount of our
    fixed-rate debt of $143.8 million was approximately
    $136.6 million and $160.8 million, based upon quoted
    secondary market prices on or before such dates. In addition,
    the volatility of the credit markets has had a negative impact
    on interest income in the last several quarters, and it is
    likely to significantly impact our interest income related to
    our cash investments in the near-term.

Currency Risk.

In the third quarter of 2009,
    one of our Canadian operating units entered into three forward
    contracts with settlement dates in December 2009, June 2010 and
    November 2010, to reduce foreign currency risk associated with
    anticipated customer sales that are denominated in South African
    rand. This same operating unit also entered into three
    additional forward contracts to reduce the foreign currency
    exposure associated with a series of forecasted intercompany
    payments denominated in U.S. dollars to be made in the next
    twelve months, which also had settlement dates in December 2009,
    June 2010 and November 2010.



The South African rand to Canadian dollar forward contracts had
    an aggregate notional amount of approximately $11.0 million
    ($CAD) at origination, with one contract for approximately
    $5.8 million ($CAD) being settled in December 2009. These
    contracts have been accounted for by the Canadian operating unit
    as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of
    the three forward contracts between the South African rand and
    the Canadian dollar have been recorded in other comprehensive
    income (loss) prior to their settlement and have been and will
    be reclassified into earnings in the periods in which the hedged
    transactions occur. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, approximately $0.3 million of loss was reclassified
    into income in connection with the settled contract. During the
    year ended December 31, 2009, a gain of $0.1 million
    was recorded to other comprehensive income (loss) related to the
    two remaining South African rand to Canadian dollar forward
    contracts.

The three Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar forward contracts had
    an aggregate notional amount of approximately $9.5 million
    (U.S.) at origination, with one contract for approximately
    $5.0 million having settled in December 2009. Such
    contracts have also been accounted for as cash flow hedges.
    Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the three forward
    contracts between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar
    have been recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) prior to
    their settlement and have been or will be reclassified into
    earnings in the periods in which the hedged transactions occur.
    During the year ended December 31, 2009, a loss of
    $0.5 million was reclassified into earnings in connection
    with the settled contract and a loss of $0.5 million was
    recorded to other comprehensive income (loss) related to the two
    remaining Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar forward contracts.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT

Management’s
    Report on Financial Information and Procedures

The accompanying financial statements of Quanta Services, Inc.
    and its subsidiaries were prepared by management. These
    financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States, applying
    certain estimates and judgments as required.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or
    detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
    well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
    absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives
    will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the
    fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
    controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further,
    because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
    evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
    misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all
    control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
    company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
    the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
    and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or
    mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual
    acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
    management override of the controls. The design of any system of
    controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the
    likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
    any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
    potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in
    the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control
    over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal
    control over financial reporting includes those policies and
    procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
    that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
    (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based upon the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2009 to provide reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation of financial statements for external reporting
    purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal
    control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
    assurances and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

The effectiveness of Quanta Services, Inc.’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009
    has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
    which appears herein.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009 excluded the four acquisitions which were
    completed during 2009. Such exclusion was in accordance with SEC
    guidance that an assessment of recently acquired businesses may
    be omitted in management’s report on internal control over
    financial reporting, provided the acquisition took place within
    twelve months of management’s evaluation. Collectively,
    Quanta’s 2009 acquisitions comprised approximately 11% of
    our consolidated assets at December 31, 2009 and
    approximately 8% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Quanta Services,
    Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, of cash flows
    and equity, present fairly, in all material respects, the
    financial position of Quanta Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries
    at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
    on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for business combinations in 2009.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded its four 2009
    acquisitions from its assessment of internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 because these
    acquisitions were acquired by the Company through purchase
    business combinations during 2009. We have also excluded the
    Company’s four 2009 acquisitions from our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting. The 2009 acquisitions of the
    Company and its related subsidiaries are wholly owned
    subsidiaries of the Company and have total assets and revenues
    which represent approximately 11% and approximately 8%,
    respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement
    amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009.

    customers and other entities with high bandwidth
    telecommunication needs. The telecommunication services provided
    through this segment are subject to regulation by the Federal
    Communications Commission and certain state public utility
    commissions.

Acquisitions

On October 1, 2009, Quanta acquired Price Gregory Services,
    Incorporated (Price Gregory). In connection with the
    acquisition, Quanta issued approximately 10.9 million
    shares of Quanta common stock valued at approximately
    $231.8 million and paid approximately $95.8 million in
    cash to the stockholders of Price Gregory. As the transaction
    was effective October 1, 2009, the results of Price Gregory
    have been included in the consolidated financial statements
    beginning on such date. Price Gregory provides natural gas and
    oil transmission pipeline infrastructure services in North
    America, specializing in the construction of large diameter
    transmission pipelines. Price Gregory’s financial results
    will generally be included in Quanta’s Natural Gas and
    Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment.

During 2009, Quanta made three other acquisitions of businesses
    that predominately provide electric power and telecommunications
    services, and are reflected in Quanta’s consolidated
    financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates.
    These acquisitions allow Quanta to further expand its
    capabilities and scope of services in various locations around
    the United States. Additionally, Quanta acquired InfraSource
    Services, Inc. (InfraSource), which provided specialized
    infrastructure contracting services to the electric power, gas
    and telecommunications industries, effective August 31,
    2007. The results of InfraSource’s operations have been
    included in the consolidated financial statements beginning on
    such date. The acquisition enhanced and expanded Quanta’s
    capabilities in its existing service areas and added the Fiber
    Optic Licensing segment.

During 2007 and 2008, Quanta made six other acquisitions of
    businesses which have been reflected in Quanta’s
    consolidated financial statements as of their respective
    acquisition dates.

Discontinued
    Operation

On August 31, 2007, Quanta sold the operating assets
    associated with the business of Environmental Professional
    Associates, Limited (EPA), a Quanta subsidiary. Accordingly,
    Quanta has presented EPA’s results of operations for the
    2007 period as a discontinued operation in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of operations.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Quanta include the
    accounts of Quanta and its wholly owned subsidiaries, which are
    also referred to as its operating units. The consolidated
    financial statements also include the accounts of certain of
    Quanta’s investments in joint ventures, which are either
    consolidated or partially consolidated, as discussed in
    following summary of significant accounting policies. All
    significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
    eliminated in consolidation. Unless the context requires
    otherwise, references to Quanta include Quanta and its
    consolidated subsidiaries.

Use of
    Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management in
    determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist
    as of the date the financial statements are published and the
    reported amount of revenues and expenses recognized during the
    periods presented. Quanta reviews all significant estimates
    affecting its consolidated financial statements on a recurring



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior
    to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on
    Quanta’s beliefs and assumptions derived from information
    available at the time such judgments and estimates are made.
    Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are
    inherent in the preparation of financial statements. Estimates
    are primarily used in Quanta’s assessment of the allowance
    for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of
    assets, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill, other
    intangibles and long-lived asset impairments, valuation of
    derivative contracts, purchase price allocations, liabilities
    for self-insured claims, convertible debt, revenue recognition
    for construction contracts and fiber optic licensing,
    share-based compensation, operating results of reportable
    segments, provision for income taxes and calculation of
    uncertain tax positions.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made in prior years’
    financial statements to conform to classifications used in the
    current year.

Revision
    of Previously Issued Financial Statements

During the third quarter of 2009, Quanta revised its
    December 31, 2008 balance sheet for the correction of
    certain errors identified in its deferred tax asset and
    liability accounts during the years 2000 through 2004. These
    items were identified in connection with Quanta’s 2009
    analysis of its tax basis balance sheet, whereby Quanta
    determined that certain deferred tax asset and liability
    accounts related primarily to goodwill impairments and certain
    bad debt expense transactions were misstated. The cumulative
    impact of these items from the period January 1, 2005
    through December 31, 2008 was an understatement of deferred
    tax assets, an overstatement of deferred tax liabilities, an
    overstatement of accumulated deficit and an understatement of
    total stockholders’ equity. Quanta evaluated the impact of
    these items under the guidance in ASC

250-10

(SEC
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99,

“Materiality,”

) on each of the years affected
    between 2000 and 2004 and on a cumulative basis for all prior
    periods subsequent to 2004 and through December 31, 2008
    and concluded the items were not material to any such periods.
    Management also evaluated the impact of correcting these items
    through a cumulative adjustment to Quanta’s 2009 financial
    statements and concluded that the cumulative impact would have
    been material to its interim results for the three and nine
    month periods ended September 30, 2009. As a result of
    these evaluations and based on the guidance within ASC

250-10

(SEC
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

“Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements
    when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements,”),

management has revised its previously
    issued financial statements to reflect the cumulative impact of
    this correction. The following table presents the impact of this
    revision on Quanta’s December 31, 2008 balance sheet

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Quanta had cash and cash equivalents of $437.9 million and
    $699.6 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2009. Cash
    consisting of interest-bearing demand deposits is carried at
    cost, which approximates fair value. Quanta considers all highly
    liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three
    months or less to be cash



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

equivalents, which are carried at fair value. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2009, cash equivalents were
    $399.1 million and $636.8 million, which consisted
    primarily of money market mutual funds and investment grade
    commercial paper and are discussed further in “Fair Value
    Measurements” below. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009,
    cash and cash equivalents held in domestic bank accounts was
    approximately $433.7 million and $669.8 million and
    cash and cash equivalents held in foreign bank accounts was
    approximately $4.2 million and $29.8 million.

Short-Term
    Investments

Quanta held no short-term investments as of December 31,
    2008 or 2009; however, during the first quarter of 2007, Quanta
    invested from time to time in variable rate demand notes
    (VRDNs), which were classified as short-term investments,
    available for sale when held. The income from VRDNs was
    tax-exempt to Quanta.

Current
    and Long-Term Accounts and Notes Receivable and Allowance for
    Doubtful Accounts

Quanta provides an allowance for doubtful accounts when
    collection of an account or note receivable is considered
    doubtful, and receivables are written off against the allowance
    when deemed uncollectible. Inherent in the assessment of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and
    estimates including, among others, the customer’s access to
    capital, the customer’s willingness or ability to pay,
    general economic and market conditions and the ongoing
    relationship with the customer. Under certain circumstances such
    as foreclosures or negotiated settlements, Quanta may take title
    to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of
    receivables. Material changes in Quanta’s customers’
    business or cash flows, which may be further impacted by the
    continuing economic downturn and volatility of the markets,
    could affect its ability to collect amounts due from them. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2009, Quanta had total allowances for
    doubtful accounts of approximately $8.8 million and
    $8.1 million. Should customers experience financial
    difficulties or file for bankruptcy, or should anticipated
    recoveries relating to receivables in existing bankruptcies or
    other workout situations fail to materialize, Quanta could
    experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current
    allowances provided.

The balances billed but not paid by customers pursuant to
    retainage provisions in certain contracts will be due upon
    completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer.
    Based on Quanta’s experience with similar contracts in
    recent years, the majority of the retainage balances at each
    balance sheet date will be collected within the subsequent
    fiscal year. Current retainage balances as of December 31,
    2008 and 2009 were approximately $101.1 million and
    $152.1 million and are included in accounts receivable.
    Retainage balances with settlement dates beyond the next twelve
    months are included in other assets, net, and as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2009 were $6.0 million and
    $2.4 million.

Within accounts receivable, Quanta recognizes unbilled
    receivables in circumstances such as when: revenues have been
    earned and recorded but the amount cannot be billed under the
    terms of the contract until a later date; costs have been
    incurred but are yet to be billed under cost-reimbursement type
    contracts; or amounts arise from routine lags in billing (for
    example, work completed one month but not billed until the next
    month). These balances do not include revenues accrued for work
    performed under fixed-price contracts as these amounts are
    recorded as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings
    on uncompleted contracts. At December 31, 2008 and 2009,
    the balances of unbilled receivables included in accounts
    receivable were approximately $122.9 million and
    $96.9 million.

Inventories

Inventories consist primarily of parts and supplies held for use
    in the ordinary course of business which are valued by Quanta at
    the lower of cost or market as determined by using either the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method or the average costing method.
    Inventories also include certain job specific materials not yet
    installed which are valued using the specific identification
    method.



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is
    computed using the straight-line method, net of estimated
    salvage values, over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
    Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the
    lesser of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of
    the asset. Depreciation and amortization expense related to
    property and equipment was approximately $55.9 million,
    $77.7 million and $86.9 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.

Quanta capitalizes costs associated with internally developed or
    constructed assets primarily associated with fiber optic
    licensing networks and software systems for internal
    applications. Capitalized costs include external direct costs of
    materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining
    internal-use assets, as well as payroll and payroll-related
    expenses for employees who are directly associated with and
    devote time to placing the assets into service. Capitalization
    of such costs are recorded to construction work in process
    beginning when the preliminary project stage is complete and
    ceases no later than the point at which the project is
    substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose at
    which point in time the asset is placed into service. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2009, approximately
    $48.6 million and $19.8 million related to fiber optic
    licensing networks and $0.5 million and $10.8 million
    associated with internally developed software systems were
    recorded in construction work in process. Those capitalized
    costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the economic
    useful life of the asset, beginning when the asset is ready for
    its intended use. Capitalized costs are included in property and
    equipment on the consolidated balance sheets.

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
    when incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments,
    which extend the useful lives of existing equipment, are
    capitalized and depreciated over the adjusted remaining useful
    life of the assets. Upon retirement or disposition of property
    and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are
    removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is
    reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount may not be realizable. If an evaluation is required, fair
    value would be determined by estimating the future undiscounted
    cash flows associated with the asset and comparing it to the
    asset’s carrying amount to determine if an impairment of
    such asset is necessary. The effect of any impairment would be
    to expense the difference between the fair value of such asset
    and its carrying value in the period incurred.

During 2009, approximately $7.8 million in net property and
    equipment was reclassified to prepaid expenses and other current
    assets as they were deemed to be assets held for sale. In
    conjunction with this assessment, approximately
    $4.5 million in losses and estimated selling costs for the
    sale of assets held for sale were recorded into selling, general
    and administrative expenses.

Other
    Assets, Net

Other assets, net consists primarily of debt issuance costs,
    long term receivables, non-current inventory, refundable
    security deposits for leased properties and insurance claims in
    excess of deductibles that are due from Quanta’s insurers.

Debt
    Issuance Costs

As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, capitalized debt issuance
    costs related to Quanta’s credit facility and convertible
    subordinated notes were included in other assets, net and are
    being amortized into interest expense on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the respective agreements giving rise to the
    debt issuance costs, which Quanta believes approximates the
    effective interest rate method. A portion of debt issuance costs
    associated with the equity component of convertible debt has
    been reclassified to equity as part of the adoption of FSP APB

14-1

(ASC

470-20).

Accordingly, the prior year amounts of debt issuance costs
    included in other assets, net and the related amortization
    expense have been retroactively restated herein. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2009, capitalized debt



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

issuance costs were $6.0 million, with accumulated
    amortization of $2.3 million and $3.2 million. For the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, amortization
    expense related to capitalized debt issuance costs was
    $2.2 million, $1.9 million and $0.9 million,
    respectively.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangibles

Quanta has recorded goodwill in connection with various of its
    acquisitions. Goodwill is subject to an annual assessment for
    impairment using a two-step fair value-based test, which Quanta
    performs at the operating unit level. Quanta has determined
    that, based on its cash flow structure and its organizational
    structure, its individual operating units represent its
    reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill
    impairments. This assessment is performed annually at year-end,
    or more frequently if events or circumstances exist which
    indicate that goodwill may be impaired. For instance, a decrease
    in Quanta’s market capitalization below book value, a
    significant change in business climate or a loss of a
    significant customer, among other things, may trigger the need
    for interim impairment testing of goodwill associated with one
    or all of its reporting units. The first step of the two-step
    fair value-based test involves comparing the fair value of each
    of Quanta’s reporting units with its carrying value,
    including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit
    exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second
    step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill. If the
    implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount,
    an impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction to goodwill
    with a corresponding charge to operating expense.

Quanta determines the fair value of its reporting units using a
    weighted combination of the discounted cash flow, market
    multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches, with
    heavier weighting on the discounted cash flow method, as in
    management’s opinion, this method currently results in the
    most accurate calculation of a reporting unit’s fair value.
    Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment
    and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such
    estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates,
    operating margins, discount rates, weighted average costs of
    capital and future market conditions, among others. Quanta
    believes the estimates and assumptions used in its impairment
    assessments are reasonable and based on available market
    information, but variations in any of the assumptions could
    result in materially different calculations of fair value and
    determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated.

Under the discounted cash flow method, Quanta determines fair
    value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting
    unit, discounted to present value using risk-adjusted industry
    discount rates, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk
    of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor
    would expect to earn. Cash flows projections are derived from
    budgeted amounts and operating forecasts (typically a three-year
    model) plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which
    are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are
    developed for each reporting unit using growth rates that
    management believes are reasonably likely to occur along with a
    terminal value derived from the reporting unit’s earnings
    before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
    The EBITDA multiples for each reporting unit are based on
    trailing twelve-month comparable industry data.

Under the market multiple and market capitalization approaches,
    Quanta determines the estimated fair value of each of its
    reporting units by applying transaction multiples to each
    reporting unit’s projected EBITDA and then averaging that
    estimate with similar historical calculations using either a
    one, two or three year average. For the market capitalization
    approach, Quanta adds a reasonable control premium, which is
    estimated as the premium that would be received in a sale of the
    reporting unit in an orderly transaction between market
    participants.

Quanta’s operations remain structured on an operating unit
    basis, with each operating unit being organized into one of
    three internal divisions, which are closely aligned with
    Quanta’s reportable segments and are based on the
    predominant type of work performed by the operating unit at the
    point in time when the divisional designation is made. The
    changes in Quanta’s reportable segments during the quarters
    ended June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009 did not
    have any impact on its operating unit structure. Because
    separate measures of assets and cash flows are not produced or
    utilized by management to evaluate segment performance,
    Quanta’s impairment assessments of its goodwill do not
    include any considerations of cash flows by its reportable
    segments.

During 2007, 2008 and 2009, a goodwill analysis was performed
    for each operating unit with estimates and industry comparables
    obtained from the electric power, natural gas and pipeline,
    telecommunications and fiber optic licensing industries, and no
    impairment was indicated. Quanta did not perform a separate
    goodwill impairment analysis as of December 31, 2007 for
    the operating unit that provides fiber optic licensing as it had
    recently been acquired in connection with the acquisition of
    InfraSource on August 30, 2007. Goodwill associated with
    that transaction was assessed in the aggregate. The

15-year

discounted cash flow model used for fiber optic licensing is
    based on the long-term nature of the underlying fiber network
    licensing agreements.

Quanta assigned a higher weighting to the discounted cash flow
    approach in all periods to reflect increased expectations of
    market value being determined from a “held and used”
    model. At December 31, 2008 and 2009, Quanta increased the
    weighting for the discounted cash flow approach as compared to
    December 31, 2007 due to the volatility of the capital
    markets at the end of 2008 and 2009, and the impact such
    volatility may have had on the accuracy of the market multiple
    and market capitalization approaches. Also at December 31,
    2008, Quanta increased some discount rates and decreased EBITDA
    multiples at reporting units to reflect potential declines in
    market conditions. At December 31, 2009, Quanta further
    decreased EBITDA multiples at operating units to reflect
    potential declines in market conditions in light of the
    continued economic recession.

Quanta’s intangible assets include customer relationships,
    backlog, trade names, non-compete agreements and patented rights
    and developed technology. The value of customer relationships is
    estimated using the

value-in-use

concept utilizing the income approach, specifically the excess
    earnings method. The excess earnings analysis consists of
    discounting to present value the projected cash flows
    attributable to the customer relationships, with consideration
    given to customer contract renewals, the importance or lack
    thereof of existing customer relationships to Quanta’s
    business plan, income taxes and required rates of return. Quanta
    values backlog based upon the contractual nature of the backlog
    within each service line, using the income approach to discount
    back to present value the cash flows attributable to the backlog.

Quanta amortizes intangible assets based upon the estimated
    consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset or
    on a straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits
    consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated. Intangible
    assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment and
    are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
    recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying
    amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its
    carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

Investments
    in Joint Ventures

During the first quarter of 2009, one of Quanta’s operating
    units entered into a joint venture arrangement that was formed
    for the purpose of providing infrastructure services under a
    contract with a large utility customer. The scope of services
    provided includes the design, installation and maintenance of
    electric transmission and distribution systems in the northeast
    United States. The joint venture members each own an equal (50%)
    equity interest in the joint venture entity and participate
    equally in the losses of the entity. Generally, Quanta’s
    share of the profits in the joint venture will be 75% and 67%
    during each of the first and second years of joint venture
    operations completed in April 2010 and 2011 and 50% thereafter.
    Certain incentive profits will be shared equally between the
    joint venture members throughout the term of the joint venture.

Quanta has evaluated its investment in this joint venture and
    determined that the joint venture is a variable interest entity,
    with Quanta providing more than half of the subordinated
    financial support to the entity through its expected provision
    of the majority of the subcontractor services to the joint
    venture. As a result, Quanta has been determined to be the
    primary beneficiary of the joint venture and has accounted for
    the results of the joint venture on a consolidated basis. The
    other 50% equity interest in the joint venture has been
    accounted for as a noncontrolling interest as of and for the
    year ended December 31, 2009.

Also during the first quarter of 2009, one of Quanta’s
    operating units began operating under the terms of an
    unincorporated joint venture which was entered into for the
    purpose of providing joint engineering and construction services
    for the design and installation of fuel storage facilities under
    a contract for a specific customer. The joint venture is a
    general partnership, and the joint venture partners each own an
    equal equity interest in the joint venture and participate
    equally in the profits and losses of the entity. Quanta has
    evaluated this investment and has determined that its investment
    in this joint venture partnership represents an undivided 50%
    interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and profits of the
    joint venture, and such amounts have been proportionally
    consolidated in the accompanying financial statements.

In conjunction with the Price Gregory acquisition on
    October 1, 2009, Quanta acquired an interest in three joint
    ventures with investments of 65%, 49% and 49%. Quanta has been
    determined to be the primary beneficiary of these joint ventures
    and has accounted for the results of the joint ventures on a
    consolidated basis with the remaining interest in each joint
    venture accounted for as a noncontrolling interest as of and for
    the year ended December 31, 2009. These joint ventures had
    nominal activity during 2009.

Infrastructure Services

— Through its Electric
    Power Infrastructure Services, Natural Gas and Pipeline
    Infrastructure Services and Telecommunications Infrastructure
    Services segments, Quanta designs, installs and maintains
    networks for customers in the electric power, natural gas and
    oil, telecommunications and cable television industries. These
    services may be provided pursuant to master service agreements,
    repair and maintenance contracts and fixed price and non-fixed
    price installation contracts. Pricing under these contracts may
    be competitive unit price, cost-plus/hourly (or time and
    materials basis) or fixed price (or lump sum basis), and the
    final terms and prices of these contracts are frequently
    negotiated with the customer. Under unit-based contracts, the
    utilization of an output-based measurement is appropriate for
    revenue recognition. Under these contracts, Quanta recognizes
    revenue as units are completed based on pricing established
    between Quanta and the customer for each unit of delivery, which
    best reflects the pattern in which the obligation to the
    customer is fulfilled. Under cost-plus/



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

hourly and time and materials type contracts, Quanta recognizes
    revenue on an input basis, as labor hours are incurred and
    services are performed.

Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to
    total estimated costs for each contract. These contracts provide
    for a fixed amount of revenues for the entire project. Such
    contracts provide that the customer accept completion of
    progress to date and compensate Quanta for services rendered,
    which may be measured in terms of units installed, hours
    expended or some other measure of progress. Contract costs
    include all direct materials, labor, subcontract costs and those
    indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect
    labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Much of
    the materials associated with Quanta’s work are
    owner-furnished and are therefore not included in contract
    revenues and costs. The cost estimation process is based on the
    professional knowledge and experience of Quanta’s
    engineers, project managers and financial professionals. Changes
    in job performance, job conditions and final contract
    settlements are factors that influence management’s
    assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs
    to complete those contracts and therefore, Quanta’s profit
    recognition. Changes in these factors may result in revisions to
    costs and income, and their effects are recognized in the period
    in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for losses on
    uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such
    losses are determined to be probable and the amount can be
    reasonably estimated.

Quanta may incur costs subject to change orders, whether
    approved or unapproved by the customer,

and/or

claims related to certain contracts. Quanta determines the
    probability that such costs will be recovered based upon
    evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific
    discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer or
    verbal approvals. Quanta treats items as a cost of contract
    performance in the period incurred if it is not probable that
    the costs will be recovered or will recognize revenue if it is
    probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be
    reliably estimated. As of December 31, 2009, Quanta had
    approximately $26.1 million of change orders

and/or

claims that had been included as contract price adjustments on
    certain contracts which were in the process of being negotiated
    in the normal course of business.

The current asset “Costs and estimated earnings in excess
    of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents revenues
    recognized in excess of amounts billed for fixed price
    contracts. The current liability “Billings in excess of
    costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts”
    represents billings in excess of revenues recognized for fixed
    price contracts.

Fiber Optic Licensing

— The Fiber Optic
    Licensing segment constructs and licenses the right to use fiber
    optic telecommunications facilities to its customers pursuant to
    licensing agreements, typically with terms from five to
    twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal options. Under
    those agreements, customers are provided the right to use a
    portion of the capacity of a fiber optic facility, with the
    facility owned and maintained by Quanta. Revenues, including any
    initial fees or advance billings, are recognized ratably over
    the expected length of the agreements, including probable
    renewal periods. As of December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2009, initial fees and advanced billings on
    these licensing agreements not yet recorded in revenue were
    $34.6 million and $35.9 million and are recognized as
    deferred revenue, with $25.1 million and $25.4 million
    considered to be long-term and included in

Income
    Taxes

Quanta follows the liability method of accounting for income
    taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are recorded for future tax consequences of temporary
    differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
    assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax
    rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the
    underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled.

Quanta regularly evaluates valuation allowances established for
    deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain.
    The estimation of required valuation allowances includes
    estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of
    deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
    taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
    differences become deductible. Quanta considers projected future
    taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
    assessment. If actual future taxable income differs from these
    estimates, Quanta may not realize deferred tax assets to the
    extent estimated.

Quanta records reserves for expected tax consequences of
    uncertain tax positions assuming that the taxing authorities
    have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. As
    of December 31, 2009, the total amount of unrecognized tax
    benefits relating to uncertain tax positions was
    $45.2 million, a decrease from December 31, 2008 of
    $14.0 million. The decrease of $14.0 million mainly
    consists of a $25.0 million reduction due to the expiration
    of certain federal and state statutes of limitations for the
    2005 tax year, a $1.9 million increase related to uncertain
    tax positions attributable to Price Gregory and an increase of
    $10.1 million related to tax positions expected to be taken
    for 2009. Quanta recognized $(6.5) million,
    $4.8 million and $(3.6) million of interest expense
    (income) and penalties in the provision for income taxes for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009. The decrease
    in interest and penalties in 2009 is due to the reduction in the
    total amount of unrecognized tax benefits during 2009. Quanta
    believes that it is reasonably possible that within the next
    12 months unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to
    $9.3 million due to the expiration of certain statutes of
    limitations.

The income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and often
    ambiguous. As such, Quanta is required to make many subjective
    assumptions and judgments regarding its tax positions that could
    materially affect amounts recognized in its future consolidated
    balance sheets and statements of operations.

Collective
    Bargaining Agreements

Certain of Quanta’s operating units are parties to various
    collective bargaining agreements with unions representing
    certain of their employees. The agreements require such
    operating units to pay specified wages and provide certain
    benefits to their union employees, including contributions to
    certain multi-employer pension plans



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and employee benefit trusts. The collective bargaining
    agreements expire at various times and have typically been
    renegotiated and renewed on terms that are similar to the ones
    contained in the expiring agreements.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
    accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due
    to the short-term nature of those instruments. Categorization
    for disclosure purposes is required for qualifying assets and
    liabilities into three broad levels based on the priority of the
    inputs used to determine the fair values. The fair value
    hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices
    (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to
    unobservable inputs (Level 3). All of Quanta’s cash
    equivalents that require categorization are categorized as
    Level 1 assets at December 31, 2008 and 2009, as all
    fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical
    assets in an active market that Quanta has the ability to access.

Quanta’s convertible subordinated notes are not required to
    be carried at fair value, although their fair market value must
    be disclosed. The fair market value of Quanta’s convertible
    subordinated notes is subject to interest rate risk because of
    their fixed interest rate and market risk due to the convertible
    feature of the convertible subordinated notes. Generally, the
    fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as
    interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The
    fair market value of Quanta’s convertible subordinated
    notes will also increase as the market price of its stock rises
    and will decrease as the market price of its stock falls. The
    interest and market value changes affect the fair market value
    of Quanta’s convertible subordinated notes but do not
    impact their carrying value. The fair market value of
    Quanta’s convertible subordinated notes is determined based
    upon the quoted secondary market price on or before the dates
    specified, which is considered a Level 2 input. The fair
    value of the aggregate principal amount of Quanta’s
    fixed-rate debt of $143.8 million was $136.6 million
    at December 31, 2008 and $160.8 million at
    December 31, 2009.

Quanta’s derivative liabilities at December 31, 2009
    are all classified as Level 2 liabilities and have a total
    fair value on such date of $0.7 million. The fair values
    are determined based on adjusted broker quotes derived from open
    market pricing information. These derivative liabilities are
    included within accounts payable and accrued expenses in the
    December 31, 2009 consolidated balance sheet.

Quanta uses fair value measurements on a routine basis in its
    assessment of assets classified as goodwill, other intangible
    assets and long-lived assets held and used. In accordance with
    its annual impairment test during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2009, the carrying amount of goodwill was
    compared to its fair value. No changes in carrying amount
    resulted. The level of inputs used for fair value measurements
    for goodwill, other intangibles assets and long-lived assets
    held and used, are the lowest level (Level 3) inputs
    for which Quanta uses the assistance of third party specialists
    to develop valuation assumptions.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Quanta recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based
    compensation based on the fair value of the awards granted, net
    of estimated forfeitures, at the date of grant. Quanta
    calculates the fair value of stock options using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted
    stock awards is determined based on the number of shares granted
    and the closing price of Quanta’s common stock on the date
    of grant. Forfeitures are estimated based upon historical
    activity. The resulting compensation expense from discretionary
    awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service period, which is generally the vesting period, while
    compensation expense from performance based awards is recognized
    using the graded vesting method over the requisite service
    period. The cash flows resulting from the tax deductions in
    excess of the compensation expense recognized for stock options
    and restricted stock (excess tax benefit) are classified as
    financing cash flows.

Functional
    Currency and Translation of Financial Statements

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the majority
    of Quanta’s operations. However, Quanta has foreign
    operating units in Canada, for which Quanta considers the
    Canadian dollar to be the functional currency. Generally, the
    currency in which the operating unit transacts a majority of its
    transactions, including billings, financing, payroll and other
    expenditures, would be considered the functional currency, but
    any dependency upon the parent company and the nature of the
    operating unit’s operations must also be considered. In
    preparing the consolidated financial statements, Quanta
    translates the financial statements of its foreign operating
    units from their functional currency into U.S. dollars.
    Statements of operations and cash flows are translated at
    average monthly rates, while balance sheets are translated at
    the month-end exchange rates. The translation of the balance
    sheets at the month-end exchange rates results in translation
    gains or losses. Under the relevant accounting guidance, the
    treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon
    management’s determination of the functional currency of
    each operating unit, which involves consideration of all
    relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the
    operating unit. If transactions are denominated in the
    entity’s functional currency, the translation gains and
    losses are included as a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity under the caption “Accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss).” If transactions are not
    denominated in the entity’s functional currency, the
    translation gains and losses are included within the statement
    of operations.

Derivatives

From time to time, Quanta enters into forward currency contracts
    that qualify as derivatives, primarily to hedge the risks
    associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
    related to certain forecasted foreign currency denominated
    transactions. Quanta does not enter into derivative transactions
    for speculative purposes; however, for accounting purposes,
    certain transactions may not meet the criteria for cash flow
    hedge accounting. For a hedge to qualify for cash flow hedge
    accounting treatment, a hedge must be documented at the
    inception of the contract, with the objective and strategy
    stated, along with an explicit description of the methodology
    used to assess hedge effectiveness. The dates (or periods) for
    the expected forecasted events and the nature of the exposure
    involved (including quantitative measures of the size of the
    exposure) must also be documented. At the inception of the hedge
    and on an ongoing basis, the hedge must be deemed to be
    “highly effective” at minimizing the risk of the
    identified exposure. Effectiveness measures relate the gains or
    losses of the derivative to changes in the cash flows associated
    with the hedged item, and the forecasted transaction must be
    probable of occurring.

For forward contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges, Quanta
    accounts for the change in fair value of the forward contracts
    directly in equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss). Any ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is
    recognized in earnings in the period ineffectiveness occurs. For
    instance, if a forward contract is discontinued as a cash flow
    hedge because it is probable that the original forecasted
    transaction will not occur by the end of the originally
    specified time period, the related amounts in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) would be reclassified to other
    income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations in
    the period such determination is made. When a forecasted
    transaction occurs, the portion of the accumulated gain or loss
    applicable to the forecasted transaction is reclassified from
    equity to earnings. Changes in fair value related to
    transactions that do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge
    accounting are recorded in the consolidated results of
    operations and are included in other income (expense).

Comprehensive
    Income

Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a
    period except those resulting from investments by and
    distributions to stockholders. As described above, Quanta
    records other comprehensive income, net of tax, for the foreign
    currency translation adjustment related to its foreign
    operations and for changes in fair value of its derivative
    contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges.

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements.

On
    January 1, 2009, Quanta adopted FSP APB

14-1

(ASC 470-20),

which requires issuers of certain convertible debt instruments
    to separately account for the liability and equity components in
    a manner that adjusts the recorded value of the convertible debt
    to reflect the entity’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate
    and interest cost at the time of issuance. The value of the debt
    instrument is adjusted through a discount to the face value of
    the debt, which is amortized as non-cash interest expense over
    the expected life of the debt, with an offsetting adjustment to
    equity to separately recognize the value of the debt
    instrument’s conversion feature. This guidance has been
    applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Accordingly,
    Quanta recorded a cumulative effect of the change in accounting
    principle to accumulated deficit as of January 1

2007 of
    approximately $29.6 million. Also included in accumulated
    deficit is the impact from non-cash interest expense recorded in
    the amounts of approximately $18.3 million

    ($9.6 million after tax effect) for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2008. In addition, Quanta recorded
    non-cash interest expense during 2009 and will continue doing so
    until Quanta’s 3.75% convertible subordinated notes are
    redeemable at the holders’ option in April 2013.
    Approximately $4.3 million ($2.8 million after tax
    effect) of non-cash interest expense was recorded in 2009. See
    the tables below for the impact of the adoption of FSP

APB 14-1

(ASC

470-20)

as of December 31, 2008 and for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2008.

Also on January 1, 2009, Quanta adopted FSP

EITF 03-6-1

(ASC 260). FSP

EITF 03-6-1

(ASC 260) states that unvested share-based payment awards
    that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend
    equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating
    securities and should be included in the computation of both
    basic and diluted earnings per share. All prior period earnings
    per share data presented have been adjusted retrospectively to
    conform to the provisions of FSP

EITF 03-6-1

(ASC 260). All of Quanta’s restricted stock grants have
    non-forfeitable rights to dividends and are considered
    participating securities under FSP

EITF 03-6-1

(ASC 260). Prior to the retrospective application of FSP

EITF 03-6-1

(ASC 260) on January 1, 2009, unvested restricted
    stock grants were included in the calculation of weighted
    average dilutive shares outstanding using the treasury stock
    method. Under this previous method, unvested restricted common
    shares were not included in the calculation of weighted average
    basic shares outstanding but were included in the calculation of
    weighted average diluted shares outstanding to the extent the
    grant price was less than the average share price for the
    respective period. The impact of the retrospective application
    of FSP

EITF 03-6-1

(ASC 260) on earnings per share for prior periods is
    immaterial. Additionally, the adoption of FSP

EITF 03-6-1

(ASC 260) had no material impact on basic and diluted
    income per share in 2009. See the Statements of Operations
    tables below for the impact of adopting FSP

EITF 03-6-1

(ASC 260) for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2008.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 141(R)-1,
    “Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in
    a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies” (ASC
    805,

Business Combinations

). FSP FAS 141(R)-1 (ASC
    805) amends the provisions related to the initial
    recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and
    disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies
    in a business combination under SFAS No. 141(R) (ASC
    805) and has the same effective date as
    SFAS No. 141(R) (ASC 805). Accordingly, Quanta adopted
    FSP FAS 141(R)-1 (ASC 805) effective January 1,
    2009. FSP FAS 141(R)-1 (ASC 805) carries forward the
    requirements



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,”
    which is now superseded, for acquired contingencies, which
    requires that such contingencies be recognized at fair value on
    the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably estimated
    during the measurement period. Otherwise, companies should
    typically account for the acquired contingencies in accordance
    with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for
    Contingencies” (ASC 450,

Contingencies

). FSP
    FAS 141(R)-1 (ASC 805) also amends the disclosure
    requirements of SFAS No. 141(R) (ASC 805) to
    require separate disclosure of recognized and unrecognized
    contingencies if certain conditions are met. Quanta has applied
    the provisions of this ASC for business combinations with an
    acquisition date on or after January 1, 2009.

On January 1, 2009, Quanta fully adopted
    SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (ASC
    820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

), which
    defines fair value, establishes methods used to measure fair
    value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value
    measurements with respect to financial and non-financial assets
    and liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 (ASC
    820) did not have a material impact on Quanta’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash
    flows or disclosures. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 157-4

“Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of
    Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased
    and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly” (ASC

820-10-35-51),

which provides additional guidance for estimating fair value
    when an entity determines that either the volume

and/or

level
    of activity for an asset or liability has significantly
    decreased. It also provides guidance to identify circumstances
    that indicate when a transaction is not orderly. FSP

FAS 157-4

(ASC

820-10-35-51)

is effective for interim and annual periods ending after
    June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted in certain
    circumstances for periods ending after March 15, 2009.
    Quanta adopted FSP

FAS 157-4

(ASC

820-10-35-51)

in the quarter ended March 31, 2009. The adoption of FSP

FAS 157-4

(ASC

820-10-35-51)

did not have any material impact on Quanta’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, cash flows or
    disclosures.

During the quarter ended March 31, 2009, Quanta adopted FSP

FAS 107-1

and APB

28-1,

“Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments” (ASC

825-10-65,

Financial Instruments — Overall —
    Transition

). FSP

FAS 107-1

(ASC

825-10-65)

requires public entities to provide the disclosures required by
    SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of
    Financial Instruments” (ASC 825,

Financial
    Instruments

) on a quarterly basis and is effective for
    interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009, with
    early adoption permitted in certain circumstances for periods
    ending after March 15, 2009. Because Quanta had been
    providing these disclosures in its quarterly reports prior to
    the issuance of FSP

FAS 107-1

(ASC

825-10-65),

the adoption of FSP

FAS 107-1

(ASC

825-10-65)

did not have any impact on Quanta’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

During the quarter ended March 31, 2009, Quanta adopted FSP

FAS 115-2

and

FAS 124-2,

“Recognition and Presentation of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairments” (ASC

320-10-65-1,

Investments — Debt and Equity
    Securities — Overall — Transition

). FSP

FAS 115-2

(ASC

320-10-65-1)

establishes a new method of recognizing and reporting

other-than-temporary

impairments of debt securities. FSP

FAS 115-2

(ASC

320-10-65-1)

also contains additional disclosure requirements related to debt
    and equity securities. FSP

FAS 115-2

(ASC

320-10-65-1)

is effective for interim and annual periods ending after
    June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted in certain
    circumstances for periods ending after March 15, 2009.
    Because Quanta has not held any debt or equity securities that
    would be within the scope of FSP

FAS 115-2

(ASC

320-10-65-1)

since its adoption, the adoption of FSP

FAS 115-2

(ASC

320-10-65-1)

did not have any impact on Quanta’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

In June 2009 and February 2010, Quanta adopted
    SFAS No. 165, “Subsequent Events” (ASC 855,

Subsequent Events

). Although SFAS No. 165 (ASC
    855) should not result in significant changes in the
    subsequent events an entity reports, it requires enhanced
    disclosures related to subsequent events occurring through the
    date which an entity has evaluated subsequent events.
    SFAS No. 165 (ASC 855) is effective for interim
    and annual financial statements ending after June 15, 2009
    and must be applied prospectively. In February 2010, the FASB
    amended this guidance to remove the requirement to include the
    date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events.



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On July 1, 2009, Quanta adopted ASC 105, which establishes
    the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the
    source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the
    FASB to be used by non-governmental entities in the preparation
    of financial statements presented in conformity with GAAP. Rules
    and interpretations of the SEC under the authority of federal
    securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC
    registrants such as Quanta. On July 1, 2009, the
    Codification reorganized the pre-Codification GAAP into
    approximately 90 accounting topics and superseded all
    then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All
    accounting literature not included in the Codification became
    non-authoritative. All of the Codification’s content
    carries the same level of authority, which effectively
    superseded SFAS No. 162. ASC 105 is effective for
    financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after
    September 15, 2009. Accordingly, Quanta adopted ASC 105 on
    July 1, 2009. The adoption of ASC 105 did not have a
    material impact on Quanta’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows but has resulted
    in changes to references to accounting principles in the notes
    to its consolidated financial statements.

Accounting
    Standards Not Yet Adopted.

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166,
    “Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets —
    an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140” (ASC 860,

Transfers and Servicing

), and SFAS No. 167,
    “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an amendment
    to FIN 46(R)” (ASC 810,

Consolidations

).
    Together these new standards aim to improve the visibility of
    off-balance sheet vehicles currently exempt from consolidation
    and address practice issues involving the accounting for
    transfers of financial assets as sales or secured borrowings.
    These new standards are effective as of the beginning of an
    entity’s fiscal year beginning after November 15,
    2009, and for interim periods within that first year, with
    earlier adoption prohibited. Accordingly, Quanta adopted
    SFAS Nos. 166 and 167 (ASC 860) on January 1,
    2010. Quanta believes the impact, if any, from the adoption of
    SFAS Nos. 166 and 167 (ASC 860) will not be material.

ACQUISITIONS:

    Acquisitions

On October 1, 2009, Quanta acquired Price Gregory in
    exchange for the issuance of approximately 10.9 million
    shares of Quanta common stock valued at approximately
    $231.8 million on the date of closing and the payment of
    approximately $95.8 million in cash. In connection with the
    acquisition, $0.5 million in cash and approximately
    1.5 million shares of Quanta common stock, valued at
    approximately $32.5 million, were placed into an escrow
    account, which will be maintained for a period of up to eighteen
    months for the settlement of any claims asserted by Quanta
    against the former stockholders of Price Gregory. Price Gregory
    provides natural gas and oil transmission pipeline
    infrastructure services in North America and expands
    Quanta’s service capabilities in this market. Price
    Gregory’s results of operations have been included in
    Quanta’s consolidated results of operations since
    October 1, 2009.

Also in 2009, Quanta completed three other acquisitions of
    specialty contractors with operations in the electric power,
    natural gas and telecommunications industries for an aggregate
    purchase price of approximately $36.0 million, consisting
    of a total of approximately $25.3 million in cash and
    approximately 0.5 million shares of Quanta common stock
    valued in the aggregate at approximately $10.7 million as
    of the dates of acquisition. These acquisitions enhance
    Quanta’s electric power, natural gas and pipeline and
    telecommunications capabilities throughout the various regions
    of the United States and Western Canada.

    Acquisitions

In 2008, Quanta acquired a telecommunications infrastructure
    services construction company, a helicopter-assisted electric
    transmission line installation, maintenance and repair services
    company and two affiliated professional telecommunications
    engineering companies in three separate transactions for an
    aggregate purchase price of approximately $54.1 million,
    consisting of a total of approximately $34.6 million in
    cash and



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

approximately 1.0 million shares of Quanta common stock
    valued in the aggregate at approximately $19.5 million as
    of the dates of acquisitions. The acquisitions allow Quanta to
    further expand its telecommunications infrastructure services
    capabilities in the southwestern and southeastern United States
    and to augment its existing electric power infrastructure
    services.

The following table summarizes the consideration paid for the
    2008 and 2009 acquisitions and the amounts of the assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at the acquisition
    dates. It also summarizes the allocation of the purchase price
    related to the 2008 and 2009 acquisitions. These allocations are
    based on the significant use of estimates and on information
    that was available to management at the time these consolidated
    financial statements were prepared (in thousands).

The fair value of current assets acquired in 2009 includes
    accounts receivable with a fair value of $156.2 million.
    The gross amount receivable is $156.2 million, of which
    none is expected to be uncollectible.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
    net amount of the values assigned to assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed. Building on Quanta’s leadership role
    in the electric transmission industry, the Price Gregory and
    other 2009 acquisitions strongly position Quanta as a leader in
    the North American energy transmission infrastructure market and
    will enable it to take advantage of the positive long-term
    outlook for the natural gas and transmission pipeline
    industries. Quanta believes these opportunities contribute to
    the recognition of the goodwill. In connection with these
    acquisitions, goodwill of $68.5 million was included within
    Quanta’s natural gas and pipeline division,
    $9.2 million has been assigned to Quanta’s
    telecommunications division and $8.6 million has been
    included within Quanta’s electric power division at
    December 31, 2009, all of which are closely aligned with
    Quanta’s corresponding reportable segments. None of this
    goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

In connection with the 2008 and 2009 acquisitions, the following
    unaudited supplemental pro forma results of operations have been

    adjusting the historical results of Quanta to include the
    historical results of the acquisitions completed in 2008 and
    2009. The pro forma combined results of operations for the year
    ending December 31, 2008 have been prepared by adjusting
    the historical results of Quanta to include the historical
    results of the four acquisitions completed in 2009 and the three
    acquisitions completed in 2008. These pro forma combined
    historical results were then adjusted for the following: a
    reduction of interest expense and interest income as a result of
    the repayment of outstanding indebtedness and the retirement of
    preferred stock, a reduction of interest income as a result of
    the cash consideration paid, an increase in amortization expense
    due to the incremental intangible assets recorded related to the
    2008 and 2009 acquisitions, an increase in depreciation expense
    within cost of services related to the net impact of adjusting
    acquired property and equipment to the acquisition date fair
    value and conforming depreciable lives with Quanta’s
    accounting policies and certain reclassifications to conform the
    acquired companies’ presentation to Quanta’s
    accounting policies. The pro forma results of operations do not
    include any cost savings that may result from the 2008 and 2009
    acquisitions. As noted above, the pro forma results of
    operations do not purport to be indicative of the actual results
    that would have been achieved by the combined company for the
    periods presented or that may be achieved by the combined
    company in the future.

Revenues of $260.3 million and income from continuing
    operations before income taxes of $37.8 million related to
    the four 2009 acquisitions following their respective dates of
    acquisition are included in Quanta’s consolidated results
    of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009.

    Acquisitions

On August 30, 2007, Quanta acquired all of the outstanding
    common stock of InfraSource through a merger transaction. In
    connection with the acquisition, Quanta issued to
    InfraSource’s stockholders 1.223 shares of Quanta
    common stock for each outstanding share of InfraSource common
    stock, resulting in the issuance of a total of approximately
    50.0 million shares of common stock for an aggregate
    purchase price of approximately $1.3 billion. The
    acquisition of InfraSource allowed Quanta to enhance and further
    expand its specialized infrastructure contract services to the
    electric power, natural gas and pipeline and telecommunications
    industries primarily in the United States. The acquisition also
    added a fiber optic licensing business.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Also in 2007, Quanta acquired two foundation drilling companies
    and a telecommunications company in three separate transactions
    for an aggregate purchase price of $58.5 million,
    consisting of a total of $36.2 million in cash and
    approximately 1.1 million shares of Quanta common stock
    valued in the aggregate at $22.4 million as of the dates of
    acquisition. These acquisitions allowed Quanta to have in-house
    capabilities to construct drilled pier foundations for electric
    transmission towers and wireless telecommunication towers and to
    further expand its telecommunications infrastructure services in
    the western United States.

The following table summarizes the consideration paid for these
    2007 acquisitions and the amounts of the assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. It also summarizes
    the allocation of the purchase price related to these 2007
    acquisitions. These allocations are based on the significant use
    of estimates and on information that was available to management
    at the time these consolidated financial statements were
    prepared (in thousands).

The pro forma impact of Quanta’s other 2007 acquisitions
    and its three 2008 acquisitions have not been included in the
    2007 pro forma information above due to the fact that they are
    immaterial to Quanta’s financial statements individually
    and in the aggregate. The pro forma combined results of
    operations have been prepared by adjusting the historical
    results of Quanta to include the historical results of
    InfraSource, a reduction in interest expense and interest income
    as a result of the repayment of InfraSource’s outstanding
    indebtedness on the acquisition date and certain
    reclassifications to conform InfraSource’s presentation to
    Quanta’s accounting policies. The pro forma results of
    operations do not include any cost savings that may have
    resulted from the acquisition of InfraSource or any estimated
    costs that have been or will be incurred by Quanta to integrate
    the business other than those incurred in 2007 subsequent to the
    acquisition. As noted above, the pro forma results of operations
    do not purport to be indicative of the actual results that would
    have been achieved by the combined company for the periods
    presented or that may be achieved by the combined company in the
    future. Additionally, InfraSource incurred $13.4 million in
    merger-related costs prior to the acquisition that have not been
    eliminated in the 2007 pro forma results of operations above.
    Items such as these, coupled with other risk factors that could
    have affected the combined company and its operations, make it
    difficult to use the pro forma results of operations to project
    future results of operations.

As described in Note 2, Quanta’s operating units are
    organized into one of Quanta’s three internal divisions and
    accordingly, Quanta’s goodwill associated with each of its
    operating units has been aggregated on a divisional basis and
    reported in the table above. These divisions are closely aligned
    with Quanta’s reportable segments based on the predominant
    type of work performed by the operating units within the
    divisions.

During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, Quanta
    recorded approximately $9.7 million and $83.1 million
    in other intangible assets associated with acquisitions.
    Additionally, in May 2008, Quanta acquired the rights to certain
    developed technology, along with pending and issued patent
    protections to this technology, for approximately
    $14.6 million. This developed technology enhances
    Quanta’s energized services capabilities and is being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated economic
    life of approximately 13 years. The acquired technology is
    included in patented rights and developed technology in the
    table below.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATION:

On August 31, 2007, Quanta sold the operating assets
    associated with the business of EPA, a Quanta subsidiary, for
    approximately $6.0 million in cash. Quanta has presented
    EPA’s results of operations for 2007 as a discontinued
    operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of
    operations. Quanta does not allocate corporate debt or interest
    expense to discontinued operations. As a result of the sale, a
    pre-tax gain of approximately $3.7 million was recorded in
    the year ended December 31, 2007 and included as income
    from discontinued operation in the consolidated statement of
    operations in such period.

    adjusted for all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents,
    except in cases where the effect of the common stock equivalent
    would be antidilutive. The amounts used to compute the basic and

For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, stock
    options of approximately 0.1 million, 0.1 million and
    0.1 million shares, respectively, were excluded from the
    computation of diluted earnings per share because the grant
    prices of these common stock equivalents were greater than the
    average market price of Quanta’s common stock. For the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, the effect of
    assuming conversion of Quanta’s 3.75% convertible
    subordinated notes would have been antidilutive and therefore
    the shares issuable upon conversion were excluded from the
    calculation of diluted earnings per share. Additionally, for the
    year ended December 31, 2007, the effect of assuming
    conversion of Quanta’s 4.0% convertible subordinated notes
    would have



QUANTA

been antidilutive and therefore the shares issuable upon
    conversion were excluded from the calculation of diluted
    earnings per share. The 4.0% convertible subordinated notes were
    not outstanding after July 2, 2007, and the 4.5%
    convertible subordinated notes were not outstanding after
    October 8, 2008.

Credit
    Facility

Quanta has a credit facility with various lenders that provides
    for a $475.0 million senior secured revolving credit
    facility maturing on September 19, 2012. Subject to the
    conditions specified in the credit facility, borrowings under
    the credit facility are to be used for working capital, capital
    expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The entire
    unused portion of the credit facility is available for the
    issuance of letters of credit.

As of December 31, 2009, Quanta had approximately
    $188.3 million of letters of credit issued under the credit
    facility and no outstanding revolving loans. The remaining
    $286.7 million was available for revolving loans or issuing
    new letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the credit
    facility bear interest, at Quanta’s option, at a rate equal
    to either (a) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the credit
    facility) plus 0.875% to 1.75%, as determined by the ratio of
    Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as
    defined in the credit facility), or (b) the base rate (as
    described below) plus 0.00% to 0.75%, as determined by the ratio
    of Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA.
    Letters of credit issued under the credit facility are subject
    to a letter of credit fee of 0.875% to 1.75%, based on the ratio
    of Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA.
    Quanta is also subject to a commitment fee of 0.15% to 0.35%,
    based on the ratio of its total funded debt to consolidated
    EBITDA, on any unused availability under the credit facility.
    The base rate equals the higher of (i) the Federal Funds
    Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 1/2 of 1% or
    (ii) the bank’s prime rate.

The credit facility contains certain covenants, including
    covenants with respect to maximum funded debt to consolidated
    EBITDA, maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA and minimum
    interest coverage, in each case as specified in the credit
    facility. For purposes of calculating the maximum funded debt to
    consolidated



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

EBITDA ratio and the maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA
    ratio, Quanta’s maximum funded debt and maximum senior debt
    are reduced by all cash and cash equivalents (as defined in the
    credit facility) held by Quanta in excess of $25.0 million.
    As of December 31, 2009, Quanta was in compliance with all
    of its covenants. The credit facility limits certain
    acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, capital expenditures,
    asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to
    certain exceptions, prohibits liens on material assets. The
    credit facility also limits the payment of dividends and stock
    repurchase programs in any fiscal year except those payments or
    other distributions payable solely in capital stock. The credit
    facility provides for customary events of default and carries
    cross-default provisions with Quanta’s existing
    subordinated notes, its continuing indemnity and security
    agreement with its sureties and all of its other debt
    instruments exceeding $15.0 million in borrowings. If an
    event of default (as defined in the credit facility) occurs and
    is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
    forth in the credit facility, amounts outstanding under the
    credit facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared
    immediately due and payable.

The credit facility is secured by a pledge of all of the capital
    stock of Quanta’s U.S. subsidiaries, 65% of the
    capital stock of its foreign subsidiaries and substantially all
    of its assets. Quanta’s U.S. subsidiaries guarantee
    the repayment of all amounts due under the credit facility.
    Quanta’s obligations under the credit facility constitute
    designated senior indebtedness under its 3.75% convertible
    subordinated notes.

3.75% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

At December 31, 2009, Quanta had outstanding
    $143.8 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75%
    convertible subordinated notes (3.75% Notes). The resale of
    the notes and the shares issuable upon conversion thereof was
    registered for the benefit of the holders in a shelf
    registration statement filed with the SEC. The 3.75% Notes
    mature on April 30, 2026 and bear interest at the annual
    rate of 3.75%, payable semi-annually on April 30 and
    October 30, until maturity.

The $122.3 million and $126.6 million of convertible
    subordinated notes on the consolidated balance sheet as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2009 are presented net of a debt
    discount of $21.5 million and $17.2 million, which is
    amortized as interest expense over the remaining amortization
    period. This debt discount was recorded in accordance with the
    January 1, 2009 adoption of FSP APB

14-1

(ASC

470-20)

as
    discussed in Notes 2 and 3. The effective interest rate
    used to calculate total interest expense for the
    3.75% Notes under FSP APB

14-1

(ASC 470-20)

was 7.85%. At December 31, 2009, the remaining amortization
    period of the debt discount is approximately 3.3 years.

The 3.75% Notes are convertible into Quanta’s common
    stock, based on an initial conversion rate of
    44.6229 shares of Quanta’s common stock per $1,000
    principal amount of 3.75% Notes (which is equal to an
    initial conversion price of approximately $22.41 per share),
    subject to adjustment as a result of certain events. The
    3.75% Notes are convertible by the holder (i) during
    any fiscal quarter if the closing price of Quanta’s common
    stock is greater than 130% of the conversion price for at least
    20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days
    ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
    fiscal quarter, (ii) upon Quanta calling the
    3.75% Notes for redemption, (iii) upon the occurrence
    of specified distributions to holders of Quanta’s common
    stock or specified corporate transactions or (iv) at any
    time on or after March 1, 2026 until the business day
    immediately preceding the maturity date of the 3.75% Notes.
    The 3.75% Notes are not presently convertible, although
    they have been convertible in certain prior quarters as a result
    of the satisfaction of the market price condition described in
    clause (i) above. If the 3.75% Notes become
    convertible under any of these circumstances, Quanta has the
    option to deliver cash, shares of Quanta’s common stock or
    a combination thereof, with the amount of cash determined in
    accordance with the terms of the indenture under which the notes
    were issued. Conversions that may occur in the future could
    result in the recording of losses on extinguishment of debt if
    the conversions are settled in cash for an amount in excess of
    the principal amount. The holders of the 3.75% Notes who
    convert their notes in connection with certain change in control
    transactions, as defined in the indenture, may be entitled to a
    make whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion
    rate. In the event of a change in control, in lieu of

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

paying holders a make whole premium, if applicable, Quanta may
    elect, in some circumstances, to adjust the conversion rate and
    related conversion obligations so that the 3.75% Notes are
    convertible into shares of the acquiring or surviving company.

Beginning on April 30, 2010 until April 30, 2013,
    Quanta may redeem for cash all or part of the 3.75% Notes
    at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
    and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Quanta’s
    common stock is equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion
    price then in effect for the 3.75% Notes for at least 20
    trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on
    the trading day immediately prior to the date of mailing of the
    notice of redemption. In addition, Quanta may redeem for cash
    all or part of the 3.75% Notes at any time on or after
    April 30, 2010 at certain redemption prices, plus accrued
    and unpaid interest. Beginning with the six-month interest
    period commencing on April 30, 2010, and for each six-month
    interest period thereafter, Quanta will be required to pay
    contingent interest on any outstanding 3.75% Notes during
    the applicable interest period if the average trading price of
    the 3.75% Notes during the five consecutive trading days
    immediately preceding the last trading day before commencement
    of the applicable interest period equals or exceeds 120% of the
    principal amount of the notes. The contingent interest payable
    within any applicable interest period will equal an annual rate
    of 0.25% of the average trading price of the 3.75% Notes
    during a five trading day reference period.

The holders of the 3.75% Notes may require Quanta to
    repurchase all or a part of the notes in cash on each of
    April 30, 2013, April 30, 2016 and April 30,
    2021, and in the event of a change in control of Quanta, as
    defined in the indenture, at a purchase price equal to 100% of
    the principal amount of the 3.75% Notes plus accrued and
    unpaid interest. The 3.75% Notes carry cross-default
    provisions with Quanta’s other debt instruments exceeding
    $20.0 million in borrowings, which includes Quanta’s
    existing credit facility.

4.5% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

During 2008, the holders of $269.8 million aggregate
    principal amount of Quanta’s 4.5% convertible subordinated
    notes due 2023 (4.5% Notes) elected to convert their notes,
    resulting in the issuance of 24,229,781 shares of
    Quanta’s common stock, substantially all of which followed
    a notice of redemption by Quanta that it would redeem on
    October 8, 2008 all of the 4.5% Notes outstanding
    pursuant to the indenture governing the notes. Quanta also
    repurchased $106,000 aggregate principal amount of the
    4.5% Notes on October 1, 2008 pursuant to the
    holders’ election and redeemed for cash $49,000 aggregate
    principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
    on October 8, 2008. As a result of all of these
    transactions, none of the 4.5% Notes remained outstanding
    as of October 8, 2008. The 4.5% Notes were originally
    issued in October 2003 for an aggregate principal amount of
    $270.0 million and required semi-annual interest payments
    on April 1 and October 1 until maturity.

4.0% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes

During the first half of 2007, Quanta had outstanding
    $33.3 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0%
    convertible subordinated notes (4.0% Notes), which matured
    on July 1, 2007. The outstanding principal balance of the
    4.0% Notes plus accrued interest were repaid on
    July 2, 2007, the first business day after the maturity
    date.

At December 31, 2009, Quanta had state net operating loss
    carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately
    $10.6 million. These carryforwards will expire as follows:
    2010, $0.3 million; 2011, $0.3 million; 2012,
    $0.3 million; 2013, $0.4 million; 2014,
    $0.1 million and $9.2 million thereafter.

In assessing the value of deferred tax assets, Quanta considers
    whether it was more likely than not that some or all of the
    deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate
    realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
    generation of future taxable income during the periods in which
    those temporary differences become deductible.

Quanta considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax
    liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning
    strategies in making this assessment. Based upon these
    considerations, Quanta provides a valuation allowance to reduce
    the carrying value of certain of its deferred tax assets to
    their net expected realizable value.

Through December 31, 2009, Quanta has not provided U.S.
    income taxes on unremitted foreign earnings because such
    earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the
    U.S. It is not practicable to determine the amount of any
    additional U.S. tax liability that may result if Quanta decides
    to no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings outside the
    U.S.

Quanta adopted FIN No. 48 (ASC 740) on
    January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of
    FIN No. 48 (ASC 740), Quanta recognized a
    $1.5 million decrease in the reserve for uncertain tax
    positions, which was accounted for as an adjustment to
    accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2007. A reconciliation

    reduction is due to the expiration of certain statutes of

    December 31, 2008, the $1.2 million in settlements
    relates to the completion of state tax audits for tax years 1998
    to 2001 and the $0.9 million reduction is due to the
    expiration of certain statutes of limitations for tax years 2001
    to 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the

Quanta classifies interest and penalties within the provision
    for income taxes. Quanta recognized $(6.5) million,
    $4.8 million and $(3.6) million of interest expense
    (income) and penalties in the provision for income taxes for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.

Quanta is subject to income tax in the United States, multiple
    state jurisdictions and a few foreign jurisdictions. Quanta
    remains open to examination by the IRS for tax years 2006
    through 2009 as these statutes of limitations have not yet
    expired. Quanta does not consider any state in which it does
    business to be a major tax jurisdiction under
    FIN No. 48 (ASC 740).

EQUITY:

Stockholder
    Rights Plan

Quanta has a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which one right
    to acquire Series D Junior Preferred Stock, as summarized
    below, has been issued and attached to each outstanding share of
    common stock. Until a distribution date occurs, the rights can
    be transferred only with the common stock. On the occurrence of
    a distribution date, the rights will separate from the common
    stock and become exercisable as described below.

A “distribution date” will occur upon the earlier of:

•

the tenth day after a public announcement that a person or group
    of affiliated or associated persons other than Quanta and
    certain exempt persons (an “acquiring person”) has
    acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the total voting
    rights of the then outstanding shares of Quanta’s common
    stock; or

•

the tenth business day following the commencement of a tender or
    exchange offer that would result in such person or group
    becoming an acquiring person.

Following the distribution date, holders of rights will be
    entitled to purchase from Quanta one one-thousandth (1/1000th)
    of a share of Series D Junior Preferred Stock at a purchase
    price of $153.33, subject to adjustment.

In the event that any person or group becomes an acquiring
    person, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a
    right, other than rights beneficially owned by the acquiring
    person, will thereafter have the right to receive upon payment
    of the purchase price, that number of shares of common stock
    having a market value equal to the result obtained by
    (A) multiplying the then current purchase price by the
    number of one one-thousandths of a share of Series D Junior
    Preferred Stock for which the right is then exercisable, and
    dividing that product by (B) 50% of the current per share
    market price of shares of Quanta common stock on the date of
    such occurrence. If, following the date of a public announcement
    that an acquiring person has become such, (1) Quanta is
    acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction
    and Quanta is not the surviving corporation, (2) any person
    consolidates or merges with Quanta and all or part of the common
    stock is converted or exchanged for securities, cash or property
    of any other person, or (3) 50% or more of Quanta’s
    assets or earning power is sold or transferred, then the rights
    will “flip-over.” At that time, each right will
    entitle its holder to purchase, for the purchase price, a number
    of shares of common stock of the surviving entity in any such
    merger, consolidation or other business combination or the
    purchaser in any such sale or transfer with a market value equal
    to the result obtained by (X) multiplying the then current
    purchase price by the number of one one-thousandths of a share
    of Series D Junior Preferred Stock for which the right is
    then exercisable, and dividing that product by (Y) 50% of
    the current per share market price of the shares of common stock
    of the surviving entity on the date of consummation of such
    consolidation, merger, sale or transfer.

The rights expire on March 8, 2010. A holder of a right
    will not have any rights as a stockholder of Quanta, including
    the right to vote or to receive dividends, until a right is
    exercised.

Limited
    Vote Common Stock

The shares of Limited Vote Common Stock have rights similar to
    shares of common stock, except that such shares are entitled to
    elect one member of the Board of Directors and are entitled to
    one-tenth of one vote for each share held on all other matters.
    Each share of Limited Vote Common Stock will convert into common
    stock upon disposition by the holder of such shares in
    accordance with the transfer restrictions applicable to such
    shares. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and
    2009, 155,634 shares, 11,790 shares and no shares,
    respectively, of Limited Vote Common Stock were converted to
    common stock. In addition, in 2008, Quanta issued an aggregate
    90,394 shares of its common stock in exchange for an
    aggregate 86,088 shares of Limited Vote Common Stock.

Treasury
    Stock

Pursuant to the stock incentive plans described in Note 12,
    employees may elect to satisfy their tax withholding obligations
    upon vesting of restricted stock by having Quanta make such tax
    payments and withhold a number of vested shares having a value
    on the date of vesting equal to their tax withholding
    obligation. As a result of such employee elections, Quanta
    withheld 213,403 shares of Quanta common stock in 2007 with
    a total market value of $5.1 million, 188,714 shares
    of Quanta common stock in 2008 with a total market value of
    $4.5 million and 210,469 shares of Quanta common stock
    in 2009 with a total market value of $3.6 million for
    settlement of employee tax liabilities. These shares were
    accounted for as treasury stock. Under Delaware corporate law,
    treasury stock is not entitled to vote or be counted for quorum
    purposes.

Noncontrolling
    Interest

During the first quarter of 2009, Quanta acquired a 50% interest
    in a joint venture that qualifies as a variable interest entity
    and has been included on a consolidated basis in the
    accompanying financial statements as described in Note 2.
    As a result, income attributable to the other joint venture
    member has been accounted for as a reduction of reported net
    income of approximately $1.3 million related to the
    noncontrolling interest for the year ended December 31,
    2009 to derive net income attributable to the common
    stockholders of Quanta. Equity in the consolidated assets and
    liabilities of the joint venture attributable to the other joint
    venture member has been accounted for as a noncontrolling
    interest component of total equity in the accompanying balance
    sheet.

In conjunction with the Price Gregory acquisition on
    October 1, 2009, Quanta acquired an investment in three
    joint ventures with investments of 65%, 49% and 49%. These
    investments have been included on a consolidated basis in the
    accompanying financial statements with $0.1 million
    recorded as income attributable to the other joint venture
    members which is accounted for as a reduction of reported net
    income attributable to common stock for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Equity in the consolidated assets and
    liabilities of the joint ventures attributable to the other
    joint venture members has been accounted for as a noncontrolling
    interest component of total equity in the accompanying balance
    sheet.

The carrying value of the investment held by Quanta in these
    variable interest entities was approximately $1.4 million
    at December 31, 2009. The carrying value of the investment
    held by the noncontrolling interest in these variable interest
    entities at December 31, 2009 was $1.4 million. There
    were no changes in equity as a result of transfers (to) from the
    noncontrolling interest during the period.

Comprehensive
    Income

Quanta’s foreign operations are translated into
    U.S. dollars, and a translation adjustment is recorded in
    other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as a result.
    Additionally, unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency

In the third quarter of 2009, one of Quanta’s Canadian
    operating units entered into three forward contracts with
    settlement dates in December 2009, June 2010 and November 2010,
    to reduce foreign currency risk associated with anticipated
    customer sales that are denominated in South African rand. This
    same operating unit also entered into three additional forward
    contracts to reduce the foreign currency exposure associated
    with a series of forecasted intercompany payments denominated in
    U.S. dollars to be made in the next twelve months, which
    also had settlement dates in December 2009, June 2010 and

    ($CAD) at origination, with one contract for approximately
    $5.8 million ($CAD) being settled in December 2009. These
    contracts have been accounted for by the Canadian operating unit
    as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of
    the three forward contracts between the South African rand and
    the Canadian dollar have been recorded in other comprehensive
    income (loss) prior to their settlement and have been and will
    be reclassified into earnings in the periods in which the hedged
    transactions occur. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, approximately $0.3 million of loss was reclassified
    into income in connection with the settled contract. During the
    year ended December 31, 2009, a gain of $0.1 million
    was recorded to other comprehensive income (loss) related to the
    two remaining South African rand to Canadian dollar forward
    contracts.

The three Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar forward contracts had
    an aggregate notional amount of approximately $9.5 million
    (U.S.) at origination, with one contract for approximately
    $5.0 million having settled in December 2009. Such
    contracts have also been accounted for as cash flow hedges.
    Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the three forward
    contracts between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar
    have been recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) prior to
    their settlement and have been or will be reclassified into
    earnings in the periods in which the hedged transactions occur.
    During the year ended December 31, 2009, a loss of
    $0.5 million was reclassified into earnings in connection
    with the settled contract and a loss of $0.5 million was
    recorded to other comprehensive income (loss) related to the two
    remaining Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar forward contracts.

Effectiveness testing related to these cash flow hedges is
    performed at the end of each quarter. Any ineffective portion of
    these contracts is reclassified into earnings if the derivatives
    are no longer deemed to be cash flow hedges. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, a nominal portion of the South African
    rand to Canadian dollar or Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar
    forward contracts were considered ineffective.

    INCENTIVE PLANS:

Stock
    Incentive Plans

Pursuant to the Quanta Services, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan
    (the 2007 Plan), which was adopted on May 24, 2007, Quanta
    may award restricted common stock, incentive stock options and
    non-qualified stock options. The purpose of the 2007 Plan is to
    provide directors, key employees, officers and certain
    consultants and advisors

with additional performance incentives by increasing their
    proprietary interest in Quanta. Prior to the adoption of the
    2007 Plan, Quanta had issued awards of restricted common stock
    and stock options under its 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (as
    amended and restated March 13, 2003) (the 2001 Plan), which
    was terminated effective May 24, 2007, except that
    outstanding awards will continue to be governed by the terms of
    the 2001 Plan. In connection with the acquisition of InfraSource
    on August 30, 2007, Quanta assumed InfraSource’s 2003
    Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan and 2004 Omnibus Stock Incentive
    Plan, in each case as amended (the InfraSource Plans). The
    InfraSource Plans were terminated in connection with the
    acquisition, and no further awards will be made under these
    plans, although the terms of these plans will govern outstanding
    awards. The 2007 Plan, the 2001 Plan and the InfraSource Plans
    are referred to as the Plans.

The 2007 Plan, which is the only plan sponsored by Quanta
    pursuant to which future awards may be made, provides for the
    award of incentive stock options (ISOs) as defined in
    Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended (the Code), nonqualified stock options and restricted
    stock (collectively, the Awards). The aggregate number of shares
    of common stock with respect to which options or restricted
    stock may be awarded may not exceed 4,000,000 shares of
    common stock. The 2007 Plan is administered by the Compensation
    Committee of the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee
    has, subject to applicable regulation and the terms of the 2007
    Plan, the authority to grant Awards under the 2007 Plan, to
    construe and interpret the 2007 Plan and to make all other
    determinations and take any and all actions necessary or
    advisable for the administration of the 2007 Plan, provided that
    the Board, or authorized committee of the Board, may delegate to
    a committee of the Board designated as the Equity Grant
    Committee, consisting of one or more directors, the authority to
    grant limited Awards to eligible persons who are not executive
    officers or non-employee directors. Specifically, the Equity
    Grant Committee has the authority to award stock options and
    restricted stock, provided (i) the aggregate number of
    shares of common stock subject to stock options

and/or

shares of restricted stock awarded by the Equity Grant Committee
    in any calendar quarter does not exceed 100,000 shares (or
    20,000 shares in any calendar quarter with respect to any
    individual) and (ii) the aggregate value of restricted
    stock awarded by the Equity Grant Committee in any calendar
    quarter does not exceed $250,000 (or $25,000 with respect to any
    individual), in each case, determined based on the fair market
    value of the common stock on the date the restricted stock is
    awarded. In connection with the adoption of the 2007 Plan, the
    Board approved the designation of the Equity Grant Committee and
    appointed John R. Colson, Quanta’s Chairman of the Board
    and Chief Executive Officer, as sole member of the committee.

All of Quanta’s employees (including its executive officers
    and directors who are also employees), non-employee directors
    and certain consultants and advisors are eligible to receive
    awards under the 2007 Plan, but only its employees (including
    executive officers and directors who are also employees) are
    eligible to receive ISOs. Awards in the form of stock options
    are exercisable during the period specified in each stock option
    agreement and generally become exercisable in installments
    pursuant to a vesting schedule designated by the Compensation
    Committee or, if applicable, the Equity Grant Committee. No
    option will remain exercisable later than ten years after the
    date of award (or five years in the case of ISOs awarded to
    employees owning more than 10% of Quanta’s voting capital
    stock). The exercise price for ISOs awarded under the 2007 Plan
    may be no less than the fair market value of a share of common
    stock on the date of award (or 110% in the case of ISOs awarded
    to employees owning more than 10% of Quanta’s voting
    capital stock). Upon the exercise of new stock options, Quanta
    has historically issued shares of common stock rather than
    treasury shares or shares purchased on the open market, although
    the plan permits any of the three. Awards in the form of
    restricted stock are subject to forfeiture and other
    restrictions until they vest. Except in certain limited
    circumstances and with respect to restricted stock awards
    awarded by the Compensation Committee covering in the aggregate
    no more than 200,000 shares of common stock, any restricted
    stock award that vests on the basis of a grantee’s
    continuous service shall not provide for vesting that is any
    more rapid than annual pro rata vesting over a three year
    period, and any restricted stock award that vests upon the
    attainment of performance goals established by the Compensation
    Committee shall provide for a performance period of at least
    twelve months, in each case, as designated by the Compensation
    Committee or, if applicable, the Equity Grant Committee and as
    specified in each award agreement.

Stock
    Options

No stock options have been granted by Quanta since November
    2002. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, the number of
    options outstanding under the 2001 Plan, all of which have
    vested, was not material. Although there are some options
    granted under the InfraSource Plans assumed in connection with
    the InfraSource acquisition still outstanding, certain
    disclosures have been omitted due to immateriality. As of
    December 31, 2009, there was approximately
    $0.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
    related to unvested stock options issued under the InfraSource
    Plans. That cost is expected to be recognized during 2010.

Restricted
    Stock

Restricted common stock has been issued under the Plans at the
    fair market value of the common stock as of the date of
    issuance. The shares of restricted common stock issued are
    subject to forfeiture, restrictions on transfer and certain
    other conditions until they vest, which generally occurs over
    three or four years in equal annual installments. During the
    restriction period, the restricted stockholders are entitled to
    vote and receive dividends on such shares.

During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009,
    Quanta granted 0.4 million, 0.8 million and
    1.1 million shares of restricted stock under the Plans with
    a weighted average grant price of $25.72, $23.57 and $22.10,
    respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2008 and 2009, 0.7 million, 0.6 million and
    0.6 million shares vested with an approximate fair value at
    the time of vesting of $16.9 million, $15.0 million
    and $13.1 million, respectively. Amounts granted in 2007
    include restricted shares that were issued on August 30,
    2007 upon conversion of the InfraSource restricted stock in
    connection with the acquisition of InfraSource, and vested
    amounts in 2007 through 2009 include restricted shares that
    vested under the InfraSource Plans following the acquisition.

A summary of the restricted stock activity for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 is as follows (shares in thousands):

As of December 31, 2009, there was approximately
    $21.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
    related to unvested restricted stock granted to both employees
    and non-employees. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted average period of 1.83 years.

Compensation expense is measured based on the fair value of the
    restricted stock. For discretionary awards, compensation expense
    is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service period, which is generally the vesting period, and for
    performance based awards, compensation expense is recognized
    using the graded vesting method over the requisite service
    period. The fair value of the restricted stock is determined
    based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of
    Quanta’s common stock on the date of grant. An estimate of
    future forfeitures is required in determining the period
    expense. Quanta uses historical data to estimate the forfeiture
    rate; however, these estimates are subject to change and may
    impact the value that will ultimately be realized as
    compensation expense.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS:

Unions’
    Multi-Employer Pension Plans

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
    by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980,
    imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors
    to a multi-employer plan in the event of the employer’s
    withdrawal from, or upon termination of, such plan. None of
    Quanta’s operating units have any current plans to withdraw
    from these plans. Because no Quanta operating unit is currently
    contemplating a withdrawal from any plan, it is not possible to
    ascertain the net assets and actuarial present value of the
    plans’ unfunded vested benefits allocable to any Quanta
    operating unit, or the amounts, if any, for which any Quanta
    operating unit may be contingently liable, if such a withdrawal
    from a plan were to occur in the future. In addition, the
    Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding rules generally
    applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer
    plans that are classified as “endangered,”
    “seriously endangered,” or “critical”
    status. For a plan in critical status, additional required
    contributions and benefit reductions apply. Quanta has been
    notified that two plans to which a Quanta operating unit
    contributes are in “critical” status. One of the plans
    requires additional contributions in the form of a surcharge on
    future benefit contributions required for future work performed
    by union employees covered by this plan. No additional
    contributions are required for the other plan. Quanta is not
    aware of any other plans to which any Quanta operating unit
    contributes that is in “critical” status.
    Contributions to all union multi-employer pension plans by
    Quanta were approximately $69.7 million, $76.8 million
    and $84.0 million for the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.

Quanta
    401(k) Plan

Quanta has a 401(k) plan pursuant to which employees who are not
    provided retirement benefits through a collective bargaining
    agreement may make contributions through a payroll deduction.
    Quanta makes matching cash contributions of 100% of each
    employee’s contribution up to 3% of that employee’s
    salary and 50% of each employee’s contribution between 3%
    and 6% of such employee’s salary, up to the maximum amount
    permitted by law. Prior to joining Quanta’s 401(k) plan,
    certain subsidiaries of Quanta provided various defined
    contribution plans to their employees. Contributions to all
    non-union defined contribution plans by Quanta were
    approximately $6.1 million, $10.4 million and
    $10.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2008 and 2009, respectively.

RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

Certain of Quanta’s operating units have entered into
    related party lease arrangements for operational facilities,
    typically with prior owners of certain acquired businesses.
    These lease agreements generally have terms of up to five years.
    Related party lease expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 was approximately
    $4.0 million, $3.9 million and $5.4 million,
    respectively.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES:

Joint
    Venture Contingencies

As described in Note 2, one of Quanta’s operating
    units entered into a joint venture with a third party
    engineering company during the first quarter of 2009 for the
    purpose of providing infrastructure services under a contract
    with a large utility customer. Losses incurred by the joint
    venture are typically shared equally by the joint venture
    members. However, under the terms of the joint venture
    agreement, each member of the joint venture has guaranteed all
    of the obligations of the joint venture under the contract with
    the customer and therefore can be liable for full performance of
    the contract to the customer. Quanta is not aware of
    circumstances that would lead to future claims against it for
    material amounts in connection with this performance guarantee.

In addition, as described in Note 2, another of
    Quanta’s operating units began operations during the first
    quarter of 2009 in a joint venture with a third party for the
    purpose of providing joint engineering and construction services
    for the design and installation of fuel storage facilities under
    a contract with a specific customer. Under the joint venture
    agreement, the losses incurred by the joint venture are
    typically shared equally by the joint venture partners. However,
    the joint venture is a general partnership, and as such, the
    joint venture partners are jointly and severally liable for all
    of the obligations of the joint venture, including obligations
    owed to the customer or any other person or entity. Quanta is
    not aware of circumstances that would lead to future claims
    against it for material amounts in connection with its joint and
    several liability.

In each of the above joint venture arrangements, each joint
    venturer has indemnified the other for any liabilities incurred
    in excess of the liabilities for which the joint venturer is
    obligated to bear under the respective joint venture agreement.
    It is possible, however, that Quanta could be required to pay or
    perform obligations in excess of its share if the other joint
    venturer failed or refused to pay or perform its share of the
    obligations. Quanta is not aware of circumstances that would
    lead to future claims against it for material amounts that would
    not be indemnified.

Leases

Quanta leases certain land, buildings and equipment under
    non-cancelable lease agreements, including related party leases
    as discussed in Note 14. The terms of these agreements vary
    from lease to lease, including some with renewal options and
    escalation clauses. The following schedule shows the future
    minimum lease payments under these leases as of
    December 31, 2009 (in thousands):

QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Rent expense related to operating leases was approximately
    $86.7 million, $107.2 million and $112.2 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009,
    respectively.

Quanta has guaranteed the residual value on certain of its
    equipment operating leases. Quanta guarantees the difference
    between this residual value and the fair market value of the
    underlying asset at the date of termination of the leases. At
    December 31, 2009, the maximum guaranteed residual value
    was approximately $133.4 million. Quanta believes that no
    significant payments will be made as a result of the difference
    between the fair market value of the leased equipment and the
    guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no assurance
    that significant payments will not be required in the future.

Committed
    Capital Expenditures

Quanta has committed various amounts of capital for expansion of
    its fiber optic network. Quanta typically does not commit
    capital to new network expansions until it has a committed
    licensing arrangement in place with at least one customer. The
    amounts of committed capital expenditures are estimates of costs
    required to build the networks under contract. The actual
    capital expenditures related to building the networks could vary
    materially from these estimates. As of December 31, 2009,
    Quanta estimates these committed capital expenditures to be
    approximately $12.1 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010.

Litigation

Quanta is also from time to time party to various lawsuits,
    claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary
    course of business. These actions typically seek, among other
    things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of
    contract

and/or

property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
    losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all
    such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, Quanta records reserves
    when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
    amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. None of these
    proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, are expected to
    have a material adverse effect on Quanta’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

Quanta is subject to concentrations of credit risk related
    primarily to its cash and cash equivalents and accounts
    receivable. Substantially all of Quanta’s cash investments
    are managed by what it believes to be high credit quality
    financial institutions. In accordance with Quanta’s
    investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest
    this cash in a diversified portfolio of what Quanta believes to
    be high quality investments, which consist primarily of
    interest-bearing demand deposits, money market mutual funds and
    investment grade commercial paper with original maturities of
    three months or less. Although Quanta does not currently believe
    the principal amount of these investments is subject to any
    material risk of loss, the volatility in the financial markets
    significantly impacted the interest income Quanta receives from
    these investments and is likely to do so in the future. In
    addition, Quanta grants credit under normal payment terms,
    generally without collateral, to its customers, which include
    electric power, natural gas and pipeline companies,
    telecommunications and cable television system operators,
    governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners
    and managers of commercial and industrial properties located
    primarily in the United States. Consequently, Quanta is subject
    to potential credit risk related to changes in business and
    economic factors throughout the United States, which may be
    heightened as a result of the on going economic downturn and
    volatility of the markets. However, Quanta generally has certain
    statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Under
    certain circumstances, such as foreclosures or negotiated
    settlements, Quanta may take title to the underlying assets in
    lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. In such
    circumstances, extended time frames may be required to liquidate
    these assets, causing the amounts realized to differ from the
    value of the assumed receivable. Historically, some of
    Quanta’s customers have experienced significant financial
    difficulties, and others may experience financial difficulties
    in the future. These difficulties expose Quanta to increased
    risk related to collectability of receivables for services
    Quanta has performed. No customers represented 10% or more of

    2009 or of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2008 and
    2009.

Self-Insurance

Quanta is insured for employer’s liability, general
    liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation claims.
    As of August 1, 2009, Quanta renewed its employer’s
    liability, general liability, auto liability and workers’
    compensation policies for the current 2009 to 2010 policy year.
    As a result of the renewal, the deductibles for all policies
    have increased to $5.0 million per occurrence, other than
    employer’s liability which is subject to a deductible of
    $1.0 million. Additionally, in connection with this
    renewal, the amount of letters of credit required by Quanta to
    secure its obligations under its casualty insurance program,
    which is discussed further below, has increased. Quanta also has
    employee health care benefit plans for most employees not
    subject to collective bargaining agreements, of which the
    primary plan is subject to a deductible of $350,000 per claimant
    per year. For the policy year ended July 31, 2009,
    employer’s liability claims were subject to a deductible of
    $1.0 million per occurrence, general liability and auto
    liability claims were subject to a deductible of
    $3.0 million per occurrence, and workers’ compensation
    claims were subject to a deductible of $2.0 million per
    occurrence. Additionally, for the policy year ended
    July 31, 2009, Quanta’s workers’ compensation
    claims were subject to an annual cumulative aggregate liability
    of up to $1.0 million on claims in excess of
    $2.0 million per occurrence. Quanta’s deductibles have
    varied in periods prior to August 1, 2008.

Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based
    upon Quanta’s estimates of the ultimate liability for
    claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not
    reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These
    insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due
    to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the
    determination of Quanta’s liability in proportion to other
    parties, the number of incidents not reported and the
    effectiveness of its safety program. The accruals are based upon
    known facts and historical trends and management believes such
    accruals to be adequate. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009,
    the gross amount accrued for insurance claims totaled
    $147.9 million and $153.6 million, with
    $105.0 million and $109.8 million considered to be
    long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Related
    insurance recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2008
    and 2009 were $12.5 million and $33.7 million, of
    which $7.2 million and $13.4 million are included in
    prepaid expenses and other current assets and $5.3 million
    and $20.3 million are included in other assets, net.

Quanta renews its insurance policies on an annual basis, and
    therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may
    change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel
    Quanta’s coverage or determine to exclude certain items
    from coverage, or the cost to obtain such coverage may become
    unreasonable. In any such event, Quanta’s overall risk
    exposure would increase which could negatively affect its
    results of operations and financial condition.

Letters
    of Credit

Certain of Quanta’s vendors require letters of credit to
    ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on its
    behalf, such as to beneficiaries under its self-funded insurance
    programs. In addition, from time to time some customers require
    Quanta to post letters of credit to ensure payment to its
    subcontractors and vendors under those contracts and to
    guarantee performance under its contracts. Such letters of
    credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial
    institution. The letter of credit commits the issuer to pay
    specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the
    holder demonstrates that Quanta has failed to perform specified
    actions. If this were to occur, Quanta would be required to
    reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the
    circumstances of such a reimbursement, Quanta may also have to
    record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. Quanta does
    not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be
    made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2009, Quanta had $188.3 million in
    letters of credit outstanding under its credit facility
    primarily to secure obligations under its casualty insurance
    program. These are irrevocable stand-by letters of credit

with maturities generally expiring at various times throughout
    2010. Upon maturity, it is expected that the majority of these
    letters of credit will be renewed for subsequent one-year
    periods.

Performance
    Bonds and Parent Guarantees

In certain circumstances, Quanta is required to provide
    performance bonds in connection with its contractual
    commitments. Quanta has indemnified its sureties for any
    expenses paid out under these performance bonds. As of
    December 31, 2009, the total amount of outstanding
    performance bonds was approximately $732.5 million, and the
    estimated cost to complete these bonded projects was
    approximately $177.6 million.

Quanta, from time to time, guarantees the obligations of its
    wholly owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain
    contracts with customers, certain lease obligations and, in some
    states, obligations in connection with obtaining
    contractors’ licenses. Quanta has also guaranteed the
    obligations of its wholly owned subsidiary under the joint
    venture arrangement entered into in the first quarter of 2009
    with a third party engineering company.

Employment
    Agreements

Quanta has various employment agreements with certain executives
    and other employees, which provide for compensation and certain
    other benefits and for severance payments under certain
    circumstances. Certain employment agreements also contain
    clauses that become effective upon a change of control of
    Quanta. Upon the occurrence of any of the defined events in the
    various employment agreements, Quanta will pay certain amounts
    to the employee, which vary with the level of the
    employee’s responsibility.

Collective
    Bargaining Agreements

Certain of Quanta’s operating units are parties to various
    collective bargaining agreements with certain of their
    employees. The agreements require such operating units to pay
    specified wages, provide certain benefits to their union
    employees and contribute certain amounts to multi-employer
    pension plans and employee benefit trusts. If the participating
    operating units withdrew from, or otherwise terminated
    participation in, one or more multi-employer pension plans or
    the plans were to otherwise become underfunded, the subsidiaries
    could be assessed liabilities for additional contributions
    related to the underfunding of these plans. The collective
    bargaining agreements expire at various times and have typically
    been renegotiated and renewed on terms similar to the ones
    contained in the expiring agreements.

Indemnities

Quanta has indemnified various parties against specified
    liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in
    connection with Quanta’s previous acquisitions of certain
    companies. The indemnities under acquisition agreements usually
    are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that
    reach specified thresholds. Quanta also generally indemnifies
    its customers for the services it provides under its contracts,
    as well as other specified liabilities, which may subject Quanta
    to indemnity claims and liabilities and related litigation. As
    of December 31, 2009, Quanta is not aware of any asserted
    claims against it for material amounts in connection with these
    indemnity obligations.

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION:

In connection with the acquisition of Price Gregory and its
    impact on Quanta’s divisional structure used for internal
    management purposes, an updated evaluation of Quanta’s
    reportable segments was performed during the third quarter of
    2009. As a result, Quanta’s operations are now presented
    under four reportable segments: (1) Electric Power
    Infrastructure Services, (2) Natural Gas and Pipeline
    Infrastructure Services, (3) Telecommunications
    Infrastructure Services and (4) Fiber Optic Licensing. This
    structure is generally focused on broad end-user markets for
    Quanta’s services.



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment provides
    comprehensive network solutions to customers in the electric
    power industry. Services performed by the Electric Power
    Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design,
    installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power
    transmission and distribution networks and substation facilities
    along with other engineering and technical services. This
    segment also provides emergency restoration services, including
    repairing infrastructure damaged by inclement weather, the
    energized installation, maintenance and upgrade of electric
    power infrastructure utilizing unique bare hand and hot stick
    methods and our proprietary robotic arm technologies, and the
    installation of “smart grid” technologies on electric
    power networks. In addition, this segment designs, installs and
    maintains wind turbine facilities and solar arrays and related
    switchyards and transmission networks for renewable power
    generation sources. To a lesser extent, this segment provides
    services such as the design, installation, maintenance and
    repair of commercial and industrial wiring, installation of
    traffic networks and the installation of cable and control
    systems for light rail lines.

The Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment
    provides comprehensive network solutions to customers involved
    in the transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline
    products. Services performed by the Natural Gas and Pipeline
    Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design,
    installation, repair and maintenance of natural gas and oil
    transmission and distribution systems, compressor and pump
    stations and gas gathering systems, as well as related
    trenching, directional boring and automatic welding services. In
    addition, this segment’s services include pipeline
    protection, pipeline integrity and rehabilitation and
    fabrication of pipeline support systems and related structures
    and facilities. This segment also provides emergency restoration
    services, including repairing natural gas and oil pipeline
    infrastructure damaged by inclement weather. To a lesser extent,
    this segment designs, installs and maintains airport fueling
    systems as well as water and sewer infrastructure.

The Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segment
    predominantly provides comprehensive network solutions to
    customers in the telecommunications and cable television
    industries. Services performed by the Telecommunications
    Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design,
    installation, repair and maintenance of fiber optic, copper and
    coaxial cable networks used for video, data and voice
    transmission, as well as the design and installation of wireless
    communications towers and switching systems. This segment also
    provides emergency restoration services, including repairing
    telecommunications infrastructure damaged by inclement weather.
    To a lesser extent, services provided under this segment include
    cable locating, splicing and testing of fiber optic networks and
    residential installation of fiber optic cabling.

The Fiber Optic Licensing segment designs, procures, constructs
    and maintains fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure in
    select markets and licenses the right to use these

point-to-point

fiber optic telecommunications facilities to its customers
    pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with lease terms
    from five to twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal
    options. Under those agreements, customers are provided the
    right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic
    facility, with the facility owned and maintained by Quanta. The
    Fiber Optic Licensing segment provides services educational and
    healthcare institutions, large industrial and financial services
    customers and other entities with high bandwidth
    telecommunication needs. The telecommunication services provided
    through this segment are subject to regulation by the Federal
    Communications Commission and certain state public utility
    commissions.

Quanta’s segment results are derived from the types of
    services provided across its operating units in each of the end
    user markets described above. Quanta’s entrepreneurial
    business model allows each of its operating units to serve the
    same or similar customers and to provide a range of services
    across end user markets. Quanta’s operating units are
    organized into one of three internal divisions, namely, the
    electric power division, natural gas and pipeline division and
    telecommunications division. These internal divisions are
    closely aligned with the reportable segments described above
    based on their operating units’ predominant type of work,
    with the operating units providing predominantly
    telecommunications and fiber optic licensing services being
    managed within the same internal division.



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Reportable segment information, including revenues and operating
    income by type of work, is gathered from each operating unit for
    the purpose of evaluating segment performance in support of
    Quanta’s market strategies. These classifications of
    Quanta’s operating unit revenues by type of work for
    segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the
    part of management. Quanta’s operating units may perform
    joint infrastructure service projects for customers in multiple
    industries, deliver multiple types of network services under a
    single customer contract or provide service across industries,
    for example, joint trenching projects to install distribution
    lines for electric power, natural gas and telecommunications
    customers or the installation of broadband communication over
    electric power lines.

In addition, Quanta’s integrated operations and common
    administrative support at each of its operating units requires
    that certain allocations, including allocations of shared and
    indirect costs, such as facility costs, indirect operating
    expenses including depreciation, and general and administrative
    costs, are made to determine operating segment profitability.
    Corporate costs, such as payroll and benefits, employee travel
    expenses, facility costs, professional fees, acquisition costs
    and amortization related to certain intangible assets are not
    allocated.

Prior to the second quarter of 2009, Quanta reported its results
    under two business segments, with all of its operating segments,
    other than the operating segment comprising the Fiber Optic
    Licensing segment, aggregated into the Infrastructure Services
    segment. During the second quarter of 2009, Quanta reported its
    results under three reportable segments:
    (1) Electric & Gas Infrastructure Services,
    (2) Telecom & Ancillary Infrastructure Services
    and (3) Dark Fiber. The prior periods have been restated to
    reflect the change to the four reportable segments described
    above.

    December 31, 2009, which are primarily included in the
    Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment.



QUANTA
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Separate measures of Quanta’s assets and cash flows,
    including capital expenditures, by reportable segment are not
    produced or utilized by management to evaluate segment
    performance. Quanta’s fixed assets include operating
    machinery, equipment and vehicles that are used on an
    interchangeable basis across its reportable segments, as well as
    office equipment, buildings and leasehold improvements that are
    shared across segment operations. As a result, depreciation is
    allocated to Quanta’s reportable segments based upon each
    operating unit’s revenue contribution to each reportable
    segment.

Foreign
    Operations

Quanta does not have significant operations or long-lived assets
    in countries outside of the United States. Quanta derived
    $71.5 million, $98.8 million and $112.2 million
    of its revenues from foreign operations, the majority of which
    was earned in Canada, during 2007, 2008 and 2009. In addition,
    Quanta held property and equipment of $9.0 million,
    $6.5 million and $57.1 million in foreign countries as
    of December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009. The increase in
    property and equipment held by Quanta in foreign countries from
    2008 to 2009 is primarily associated with the acquisition of
    Price Gregory.

ITEM 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

There have been no changes in or disagreements with accountants
    on accounting and financial disclosure within the parameters of
    Item 304(b) of

Regulation S-K.

ITEM 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

are certifications of Quanta’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer that are required in accordance with

Rule 13a-14

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
    Act). This “Controls and Procedures” section includes
    information concerning the controls and controls evaluation
    referred to in the certifications and it should be read in
    conjunction with the certifications for a more complete
    understanding of the topics presented.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management has established and maintains a system of
    disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide
    reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
    by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
    Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC rules and forms. The disclosure controls and procedures are
    also designed to provide reasonable assurance that such
    information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we
    evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to

Rule 13a-15(b)

of the Exchange Act. This evaluation was carried out under the
    supervision and with the participation of our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer. Based on this evaluation, these officers have concluded
    that, as of December 31, 2009, our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance of
    achieving their objectives.

Evaluation
    of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management’s Annual Report on internal control over
    financial reporting can be found in Item 8 of this Annual
    Report under the heading “Report of Management” and is
    incorporated herein by reference. The report of
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, on the financial statements, and its opinion on
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, can also be found in Item 8 of this Annual
    Report under the heading “Report of Independent Registered
    Public Accounting Firm” and is incorporated herein by
    reference.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2009, that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

Design
    and Operation of Control Systems

Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting
    will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control
    system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
    only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control
    system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control
    system must reflect the fact that there are resource
    constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
    relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent
    limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
    can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
    or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances
    of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These
    inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
    decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because
    of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can be circumvented by
    the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
    people, or by management override of the controls. The design of
    any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions
    about the



likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
    any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
    potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in
    the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
