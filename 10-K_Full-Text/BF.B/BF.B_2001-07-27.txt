(c) Narrative description of business:

The following is a description of our operations.

Wine and Spirits Segment
- ------------------------
Wine  and  Spirits  operations  include  manufacturing,   bottling,   importing,
exporting,  and  marketing a wide variety of  alcoholic  beverage  brands.  This
Segment also manufactures and markets new and used oak barrels.

The Segment's brands consist of the following:

     Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey
     Southern Comfort
     Canadian Mist Canadian Whisky
     Early Times Kentucky Whisky
     Finlandia Vodkas*
     Old Forester Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whisky
     Glenmorangie Single Highland Malt Scotch Whiskies*
     Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails
     Gentleman Jack Rare Tennessee Whiskey
     Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Tennessee Whiskey
     Woodford Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey
     Fetzer Vineyards California Wines
     Korbel California Champagnes, Wines and Brandy*
     Bolla Italian Wines
     Sonoma-Cutrer Chardonnay Wines
     Bonterra Vineyards California Wines
     Jekel Vineyards California Wines
     Fontana Candida Italian Wines*
     Don Eduardo Tequilas*
     Ardberg Single Islay Malt Scotch Whisky*
     Usher's Scotch Whisky*
     McPherson Australian Wines*



     Mariah California Wines

     Tuaca Liqueur*
     Pepe Lopez Tequilas
     Bel Arbor California Wines
     Glen Moray Single Speyside Malt Scotch Whisky*
     Michel Picard French Wines*
     Owen's Estate Australian Wines*
     Geoff Merrill Reserve Australian Wines*
     Armstrong Ridge California Champagne*



    * Brands represented in the U.S and other select markets by Brown-Forman


Statistics  based  on  case  sales,   published  annually  by  a  leading  trade
publication,  rank Jack  Daniel's as the largest  selling  bourbon or  Tennessee
whiskey  in the  United  States,  Canadian  Mist as the  second-largest  selling
Canadian  whiskey in the United States,  Southern  Comfort as the  third-largest
selling  cordial in the United  States,  and Early  Times as the  fourth-largest
selling bourbon in the United States.

A leading industry trade publication  reported Korbel  California  Champagnes as
the  largest  selling  premium  champagne  in  the  United  States.  This  trade
publication  also reported that,  among numerous  imported wines,  Bolla Italian
Wine is the leading premium Italian table wine in the United States.  Fetzer was
ranked tenth among California  varietal wines and seventeenth among all domestic
table wines.

We believe the statistics used to rank these products are reasonably accurate.

Our  strategy  with  respect to the Wine and  Spirits  Segment is to market high
quality  products  that satisfy  consumer  preferences  and to support them with
extensive  international,  national,  and  regional  marketing  programs.  These
programs are intended to extend consumer brand recognition and brand loyalty.

Sales  managers  and  representatives  or brokers  represent  the Segment in all
states. The Segment distributes its spirits products domestically either through
state agencies or through  wholesale  distributors.  The contracts that  we have
with many of our  distributors  have formulas which determine  reimbursement  to
distributors  if we  terminate  them;  the  amount  of  reimbursement  is  based
primarily  on the  distributor's  length  of  service  and a  percentage  of its
purchases  over time.  Some  states  have  statutes  which  limit our ability to
terminate distributor contracts.

Jack Daniel's  Tennessee Whiskey and Southern Comfort are the principal products
exported by the Segment.  These brands are sold through  contracts  with brokers
and distributors in most countries.

The principal  raw  materials  used in  manufacturing  and  packaging  distilled
spirits are corn, rye, malted barley, glass, cartons, and wood for new white oak
barrels,  which are used for storage of bourbon and Tennessee  whiskey.  None of
these raw  materials is  in short  supply,  and there are adequate  sources from
which they may be obtained.

The  principal  raw  materials  used in the  production  of wines are grapes and
packaging  materials.  Grapes are primarily  purchased from independent  growers
and, from time to time, are adversely affected by weather and other forces which
may limit  production.  We believe that our  relationships  with our growers are
good.



Due to aging  requirements,  production  of whiskeys is scheduled to meet demand
three to five  years in the  future.  Accordingly,  inventories  are  larger  in
relation  to sales  and  total  assets  than  would  be  normal  for most  other
businesses.

The  industry  is  highly  competitive  and there  are many  brands  sold in the
consumer market. Trade information indicates that we are one of the largest wine
and spirit suppliers in the United States in terms of revenues.

The wine and spirits  industry is regulated  by the Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco,
and  Firearms  of  the  United  States  Treasury   Department  with  respect  to
production,  blending,  bottling, sales, advertising,  and transportation of its
products.  Also, each state regulates  advertising,  promotion,  transportation,
sale, and distribution of such products.

Under  federal  regulations,  whiskey  must be aged for at least two years to be
designated  "straight  whiskey."  The Segment ages its  straight  whiskeys for a
minimum of three to five years. Federal regulations also require that "Canadian"
whiskey must be manufactured in Canada in compliance with Canadian laws and must
be aged in Canada for at least three years.

Consumer Durables Segment
- -------------------------
The Consumer Durables Segment includes the manufacturing and/or marketing of the
following:

     Fine China Dinnerware
     Casual Dinnerware and Glassware
     Crystal Stemware
     Crystal Barware
     China and Crystal Giftware
     Collectibles and Jewelry
     Sterling Silver, Silver-Plated and Metal Giftware
     Sterling Silver and Stainless Steel Flatware
     Contemporary Tabletop, Houseware and Giftware
     Luggage
     Business Cases
     Personal Leather Accessories

All  of  the  products  of  the  Segment  are  sold  by  segment-employed  sales
representatives under various compensation  arrangements,  and where appropriate
to  the  class  of  trade,  by  specialized   independent   commissioned   sales
representatives and independent distributors.

The  Segment's  products are marketed  domestically  through  authorized  retail
stores consisting of department  stores specialty stores,  and jewelry shops and
through  retail stores  operated by the Segment.  Products are also  distributed
domestically through the institutional,  incentive,  premium,  business gift and
military  exchange  classes of trade,  and  internationally  through  authorized
retailers,  duty free stores  and/or  distributors  in select  foreign  markets.
Specially  created  collectible  jewelry and home decor products are distributed
both domestically and in the United Kingdom through the direct response channel,
including mail-order, catalogs and the internet.



Fine china and casual dinnerware,  as well as fine china giftware,  are marketed
under the Lenox trademark.  Crystal  stemware,  barware and giftware,  stainless
flatware, and silver-plated and metal giftware are marketed under both the Lenox
and Gorham trademarks.  Contemporary  tabletop,  houseware and giftware products
are marketed under the Dansk  trademark.  Sterling  silver flatware and sterling
giftware  are  marketed  under the Gorham and Kirk Stieff  trademarks.  Luggage,
business  cases,  and  personal  leather  accessories  are  marketed  under  the
Hartmann, Wings, and hStudio trademarks. The direct response sales in the United
States of specially  designed  collectible  jewelry and home decor  products are
marketed  under the Lenox and Gorham  trademarks,  while  such sales  abroad are
marketed primarily under the Brooks & Bentley trademark.

The Lenox, Gorham, and Hartmann brand names hold significant  positions in their
industries.  The Segment has granted licenses for the use of the Lenox trademark
on fine table linens, lamps and other electrical lighting products, and candles,
subject to the terms of licensing agreements.

We believe the Segment is the largest domestic manufacturer and marketer of fine
china dinnerware and the only significant domestic  manufacturer of fine quality
china giftware.  The Segment is also a leading  manufacturer  and distributor of
fine quality  luggage,  business cases, and personal  leather  accessories.  The
Segment  competes  with a number of other  companies  and is  subject to intense
foreign competition in the marketing of its fine china,  contemporary and casual
dinnerware,  crystal  stemware and  giftware,  stainless  flatware,  and luggage
products.

In the Segment's china and stainless businesses,  competition is based primarily
on quality,  design, brand, style, product appeal,  consumer  satisfaction,  and
price. In its luggage,  business case and personal leather accessories business,
competition is based primarily on brand awareness,  quality,  design, style, and
price.  In  its  direct   response/mail-order   business,   the  most  important
competitive  factors  are the brand,  product  appeal,  design,  sales/marketing
program, service, and price. In its crystal, sterling silver, silver-plated, and
metal  giftware  businesses,  competition  is based  primarily  on  price,  with
quality,  design,  brand, style, product appeal, and consumer  satisfaction also
being factors.

Clay and feldspar are the  principal  raw materials  used to  manufacture  china
products and silica is the principal raw material  used to  manufacture  crystal
products. Gold and platinum are significant raw materials used to decorate china
and crystal  products.  Leather and nylon fabric are the principal raw materials
used to manufacture luggage and business cases. Fine silver is the principal raw
material used to manufacture sterling silver giftware and flatware products; and
stainless  steel is the  principal raw material  used to  manufacture  stainless
steel flatware. It is anticipated that raw materials used by the Segment will be
in adequate supply.  However, the acquisition price of gold, platinum,  and fine
silver is influenced  significantly  by worldwide  economic events and commodity
trading.

Sales of certain Segment products are traditionally greater in the first half of
the fiscal year, primarily because of seasonal holiday buying.

Risk Factors Affecting Forward-Looking Statements:
From  time to  time,  we may  make  forward-looking  statements  related  to our
anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new products, and similar
matters. We make several such statements in the discussion and analysis referred
to above,  but we do not guarantee  that the results  indicated will actually be
achieved.



The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for
forward-looking statements. To comply with the terms of the safe harbor, we note
that the following non-exclusive list of important risk factors could cause our
actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results
or other expectations expressed in those forward-looking statements:

         Generally:  We operate in highly competitive markets.  Our business is
         subject to changes in general economic conditions, changes in consumer
         preferences, the degree of acceptance of new products, and the
         uncertainties of litigation.  As our business continues to expand
         outside the United States, our financial results are more exposed to
         foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the health of foreign economies.

         Beverage Risk Factors:  Our current outlook for our domestic beverage
         business anticipates continued success of Jack Daniel's Tennessee
         whiskey, Southern Comfort, and our other core spirits brands.  This
         assumption is based in part on favorable demographic trends in the U.S.
         and many international markets for the sale of spirits and wine.
         Current expectations for our global beverage business may not be met if
         these demographic trends do not translate into corresponding sales
         increases.  Profits could also be affected by increases in the price of
         grain, grapes or energy.  Beverage wholesalers and retailers in the
         U.S. appear to be lowering their beverage trade inventories, which
         adversely affects shipments.  In common with most other consumer
         businesses, our domestic beverage business will be hurt if the U.S.
         economy softens further or goes into a recession.  Profits from our
         international beverage business may be adversely affected if the U.S.
         dollar continues to strengthen against other currencies or if economic
         conditions deteriorate in the principal countries where we export our
         beverage products, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and
         Australia.

         The wine and spirits business, both in the United States and abroad,
         is also sensitive to political and social trends.  The U.S. beverage
         alcohol business is highly sensitive to tax increases; an increase in
         the federal excise tax (which we do not anticipate at this time) would
         depress our domestic beverage business.  Legal or regulatory measures
         against beverage alcohol (including its advertising and promotion)
         could adversely affect sales.  Product liability litigation against
         the alcohol industry, while not currently a major risk factor, could
         become significant if new lawsuits were filed against alcohol
         manufacturers.

         Consumer Durables Risk Factors:  Earnings projections for our consumer
         durables segment anticipate a continued strengthening of our Lenox
         business and the revitalization of our Hartmann business.  These
         projections could be offset by factors such as poor consumer response
         to direct mail, a soft retail environment, further department store
         consolidation, or weakened demand for tableware, giftware and/or
         leather goods.  Consumer durables are usually discretionary purchases
         and our business would be impacted if the U.S. economy softens further
         or goes into a recession.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

In the discussion below, and in the Chairman's letter, we review  Brown-Forman's
consolidated  financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years
ended April 30, 1999, 2000 and 2001. We also discuss factors that may affect the
company's  future  financial  condition.  Please  read this  section  along with
Brown-Forman's  consolidated  financial  statements for the year ended April 30,
2001, and the related notes.

When  we  make  forward-looking   statements  about  Brown-Forman's  anticipated
financial performance,  business prospects, new products, or similar matters, we
do not  guarantee  that the results  indicated  will  actually be achieved.  The
Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995  provides a safe  harbor for
forward-looking statements. To comply with the terms of the safe harbor, we have
prepared a  non-exclusive  list of  important  risk factors that could cause our
actual results to differ materially from anticipated  results. You can find this
list in Part II, Item 7 of the company's  Annual Report on Form 10-K, into which
this discussion is incorporated by reference.

                  CONSOLIDATED SUMMARY OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE

                          Fiscal 2001 Compared to 2000

Net sales  reached  record  levels in fiscal  2001,  growing $2% or $46 million.
Sales  of wine and  spirits  increased  2%,  as solid  growth  of Jack  Daniel's
Tennessee Whiskey was tempered by lower shipments of Korbel Champagne  following
the Millennium  boom.  Revenues from the consumer  durables segment improved 3%,
fueled by gains in catalogue, direct mail, and Internet channels.

International  sales  of  $370  million  were up 4% in  fiscal  2001  despite  a
weakening of foreign  currencies  against the U.S.  dollar.  Sales in the United
States,  representing 81% of our revenues  (excluding excise taxes),  grew 2% in
fiscal 2001. A slowing U.S.  economy  softened sales trends during the last half
of the fiscal year,  particularly in the traditional  wholesale  channels of our
consumer durables segment.

Gross profit is a key measure by which we gauge the quality of our  performance.
Fiscal  2001  gross  profit  growth  of 5%  outpaced  the rate of  sales  gains,
reflecting a continuing shift toward higher-margin products, as well as benefits
from selected price increases and stable costs.

By  focusing   marketing   efforts  on   high-margin   products  and   realizing
manufacturing  efficiencies,  the company's gross margin achieved a record level
of nearly  53% in  fiscal  2001.  This  ongoing  trend  has been a  particularly
impressive  achievement given the weakening of foreign  currencies over the past
five years, which has depressed our results when translated into U.S. dollars.

Operating  income for fiscal 2001  improved  $26  million,  or 7%. A $23 million
increase in profits from wine and spirits was driven primarily by growth of Jack
Daniel's.  Operating  income for the  consumer  durables  segment  increased  $3
million,  largely  attributable  to  successful  new products  sold  directly to
consumers.  In addition to the negative impact of weakening foreign  currencies,
Brown-Forman's  earnings  growth  was  tempered  by lower  profits  from  Korbel
Champagne, sales of used barrels, and Hartmann luggage.

Earnings  per share  reached a record  $3.40,  up 7% over fiscal  2000. A slower
growth rate in 2001 principally  reflects an industry-wide  contraction in sales
of sparkling wine and used barrels,  as well as weakening foreign currencies and
a softer U.S. economy.

                          Fiscal 2000 Compared to 1999

Net sales grew $125  million,  or 6%, in fiscal 2000.  Sales of wine and spirits
increased 7%, primarily driven by higher volumes for the Jack Daniel's family of
brands,  Korbel  Champagne,  and  Fetzer  Wines,  as  well  as the  addition  of
Sonoma-Cutrer.  Sales from the consumer durables segment improved 5%, reflecting
higher revenues from dinnerware and collectibles.

Gross profit growth of 8% outpaced the rate of sales growth.  A continuing shift
toward higher-margin  products,  selected price increases,  and stable costs has
resulted in a significant  improvement in  Brown-Forman's  gross margin over the
past ten years.

Operating  income improved 8% during fiscal 2000.  Profits from wine and spirits
grew $20 million, due principally to strong results by Jack Daniel's and Fetzer.
Operating  income for the  consumer  durables  segment  increased  $6 million in
fiscal 2000, reflecting broad improvement across most product lines and channels
of distribution.

Earnings per share grew 9% over fiscal 1999 to $3.18 per share, fueled by strong
operating income growth.


                              BUSINESS VALUE ADDED

Brown-Forman's  foremost  goal is to  increase  the  value of our  shareholders'
investment.  To assist us in achieving this objective,  we evaluate  performance
and compensate  our  management  based on a measure we call Business Value Added
(BVA).  We define BVA as the company's after-tax operating income less a capital
charge for net  operating  assets  employed,  recognizing  not only the  profits
generated  by the company  but also the  investment  required  to produce  those
profits.

BVA, as defined,  grew 9% in fiscal 1999 and 4% in fiscal 2000,  and declined 2%
in fiscal 2001. These results were affected by a change in U.S. tax regulations,
requiring us to repay a $200 million  deferred  tax  liability  over a four-year
period ending in fiscal 2003. Further,  although we expect recent investments in
Sonoma-Cutrer  and  Finlandia  will  enhance  BVA  over  the  long  term,  these
investments  have also diluted BVA growth rates.  Adjusted for these items,  BVA
increased 10% in fiscal 1999, 14% in fiscal 2000, and 8% in fiscal 2001.

Returns on average  invested  capital and  stockholders'  equity were  similarly
influenced  by these  same  factors.  As a result,  the  company's  returns have
therefore trended lower, but remain at very healthy rates.

                                 COMPANY OUTLOOK

We  believe  the  outlook  for  Brown-Forman's  growth  is  positive.  Long-term
demographic  trends for premium wine and spirits brands remain  favorable in the
U.S. -- the  company's  primary  market -- and,  despite  challenges  posed by a
continued weakening of international  currencies,  prospects remain promising in
other important markets as well. To capitalize on these  opportunities,  we plan
additional increases in the marketing investments behind our beverage brands. We
will also  continue to  penetrate  new markets by  expanding  our global  sales,
marketing, and distribution resources, as well as developing new products within
promising market segments.  Expanding Brown-Forman's portfolio of premium brands
represents  another  opportunity  for growth,  as  illustrated  by the company's
investments in Finlandia, Glenmorangie, and Tuaca during fiscal 2001.

The outlook is also positive for our consumer  durables  business.  Lenox is the
leader in the U.S. market for fine china dinnerware, and is continuing to create
value for shareholders by capitalizing on its portfolio of powerful brand names.
While a softening U.S. economy has slowed growth for Lenox and Hartmann products
sold through traditional wholesale channels, we are successfully  developing new
distribution channels that reach consumers directly.

We expect  fiscal 2002  earnings to grow at a rate  comparable  to fiscal  2001.
First  quarter  comparisons  to  last  year  will  be  difficult,   however,  as
significant  currency hedging gains in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 will not
be replicated in fiscal 2002.

                          Fiscal 2001 Compared to 2000

Net sales  improved $30 million,  or 2%,  driven by strong  results for the Jack
Daniel's  family of brands.  Jack  Daniel's  Black Label  experienced  excellent
consumer  demand  around the world,  with  worldwide  annual  depletions  up 6%.
Depletions improved 3% in the United States, the brand's biggest market. Volumes
grew at a  double-digit  rate in  Western  Europe and other  important  overseas
markets.

We expanded our distribution rights to Finlandia Vodka during fiscal 2001, which
also  contributed to higher  beverage  sales.  While unit volumes for Fetzer and
Bolla  declined  modestly,  higher  prices  yielded  increased  revenue for both
brands.  Shipments of Korbel Champagnes  declined  significantly in fiscal 2001,
reflecting an industry-wide contraction in sales of sparkling wines.



Worldwide depletions (case sales from wholesalers to retailers, representing our
best  approximation of consumer  purchases) for our major brands were as follows
in fiscal 2001:

Operating  income  improved  8% in  fiscal  2001.  Strong  results  for the Jack
Daniel's  family of brands were  tempered by two adverse  industry-wide  events.
Although Korbel  Champagne  gained market share during the year, a sharp decline
in the U.S.  sparkling wine category  following the Millennium  boom resulted in
lower volumes for the brand. In addition, a slowdown in Scotch production led to
a  significant  decline in sales of used  barrels to Scotch  whisky  distillers.
Excluding Korbel and the used barrel business, segment operating income improved
13%.

Weakening currencies in Europe and Australia have constrained beverage sales and
profit growth over the past several years, and current conditions  indicate this
trend will continue into fiscal 2002.


                          Fiscal 2000 Compared to 1999

Net sales grew $96 million,  or 7%, due  principally  to higher  volumes for the
Jack Daniel's family of brands, Korbel Champagne,  Fetzer and Finlandia, as well
as the addition of Sonoma-Cutrer and Tuaca.

Gross profit grew 9% during fiscal 2000.  Improvement in gross margin from 51.3%
to 52.6%  reflected  the  realization  of cost  efficiencies  and  modest  price
increases,  as well as an  improving  product  mix.  Several new and  developing
brands  contributed  to  growth in gross  profit,  including  Woodford  Reserve,
Sonoma-Cutrer, Tuaca, Glenmorangie, Don Eduardo, and McPherson Wines.

Advertising  expenses increased 8%, reflecting a sustained  commitment to brand-
building and future growth.  Selling,  general, and administrative expenses rose
14%,  primarily due to  incremental  costs  associated  with the  acquisition of
Sonoma-Cutrer,  as well as significant  investments to improve our processes and
systems.

Operating income  increased 7%, fueled by strong  worldwide  performance for the
Jack  Daniel's  family of  brands,  as well as U.S.  growth for Fetzer and Bolla
wines, Southern Comfort, and Finlandia Vodka.



                    Business Environment for Wine and Spirits

Our ability to market and sell our beverage  alcohol products depends heavily on
government  policy towards those products and the attitude of society in general
toward drinking. This is true both in the United States,  Brown-Forman's largest
market, and around the world.

The most  significant  public  issues  involving  the alcohol  industry  are the
problems associated with improper use of beverage alcohol. Brown-Forman strongly
opposes  abusive  drinking  and  contributes  significant  amounts  of  money to
programs aimed at  understanding  and curbing  alcohol abuse,  especially  drunk
driving and underage  drinking.  We also support and abide by voluntary industry
marketing and advertising  guidelines.  Brown-Forman  and other beverage alcohol
producers take a prominent role in  encouraging  responsible  consumption of our
products and in warning  against  alcohol abuse.  Brown-Forman  supports  social
awareness  organizations  that fight alcohol abuse and provide  education  about
beverage alcohol, often in partnership with government health officials.

As a society,  we are more likely to curb alcohol abuse through better education
about beverage alcohol and moderate  drinking than with  restrictions on alcohol
advertising and sales or punitive  taxation.  Especially in the U.S.,  distilled
spirits are at a disadvantage to beer and wine in taxation,  advertising and the
number  and  type of sales  outlets.  A major  goal of  Brown-Forman  and  other
distillers  is to  achieve  greater  cultural  acceptance  of our  products  and
equality  with  beer and wine in access to the  consumer.  Among the  objectives
Brown-Forman  seeks are:  greater access to television  advertising  for liquor;
fairer rules for product  distribution,  so that our  customers can purchase our
beverage products more conveniently; freedom to advertise our products outdoors,
in the face of some municipal  ordinances that  discriminate  against  billboard
advertising of beverage  alcohol;  expanded  distribution and fairer taxation of
low-proof   ready-to-drink   spirits   drinks,   which  often  have   restricted
distribution  and higher taxes than similar  wine and malt based  products;  and
improved access to foreign markets,  many of which have discriminatory  taxation
or other non-tariff barriers to U.S. beverage imports.

Beverage  alcohol  sales are  sensitive  to higher  tax rates.  In the U.S.,  no
legislation to increase  federal excise taxes on distilled  spirits is currently
pending,  but a future  tax  increase  cannot  be ruled  out.  Similarly,  state
legislatures  periodically  increase  beverage  alcohol taxes and there are even
local taxes in a few states.  The  cumulative  effect of such tax increases over
time hurts  sales.  With more than half of what a  consumer  pays going to taxes
(approximately  58% of the price of a  typical  bottle  of  bourbon),  distilled
spirits are the highest taxed consumer  product in the U.S.  Brown-Forman  works
for  reasonable  excise tax reductions to remedy this  situation.  Tax rates and
advertising  restrictions also affect beverage alcohol markets outside the U.S.,
but to date the impact of those changes in any one market is not  significant to
the company's overall business.

Sales revenue from international markets is affected by the strength of the U.S.
dollar.  Over the past several years,  the strong dollar has limited the revenue
growth of our international  business,  especially in Europe,  despite excellent
unit sales  growth.  A further  strengthening  of the dollar  would have adverse
effects on our dollar revenues.

In the publicity surrounding the many lawsuits against the tobacco industry (and
the onset of  litigation  against  the gun  industry),  some  commentators  have
suggested that other  industries,  such as alcohol,  fast foods and automobiles,
may be  next.  However,  we do not  believe  the  legal  theories  that  created
liability for the tobacco companies apply to beverage alcohol. Most importantly,
the  products are  different.  When used as  intended,  beverage  alcohol is not
harmful to otherwise healthy individuals.  Unlike tobacco,  moderate consumption
of beverage alcohol is believed to convey health benefits to many consumers.  In
particular,  scientists and health care experts report that beverage alcohol may
have positive  cardiovascular health benefits for many otherwise healthy adults.
Although  Brown-Forman does not recommend that adults drink beverage alcohol for
health reasons,  the potential  health benefits of responsible  beverage alcohol
consumption are another important  distinction between alcohol and tobacco.  The
dangers of alcohol  abuse are  commonly  known and have never been  concealed by
alcohol producers.  Indeed, distillers are at the forefront of efforts to combat
drunk  driving and  underage  drinking.  Lastly,  state and federal  governments
stringently regulate the content,  manufacture,  marketing, and sale of beverage
alcohol,  and in particular the federal  government  requires the placement of a
warning label on the beverage container.

We are in a period of  consolidation  in the  beverage  alcohol  industry,  most
notably  illustrated by the pending sale of the Seagram  Spirits and Wine Group.
Brown-Forman  partnered  with  Bacardi Ltd. in an effort to purchase the Seagram
business,  but was outbid.  Brown-Forman  recognizes the value of increasing the
scale of its  spirits  and wine  business,  particularly  as it  relates  to our
influence within the U.S. distribution system. However,  Brown-Forman also looks
at the overall cost of an acquisition  and attempts to expand its portfolio only
by  acquiring  brands  that are  additive  on a net  basis  to the  value of our
company.  Our recent equity investments in Finlandia Vodka,  Glenmorangie Scotch
Whisky and Sonoma-Cutrer Wines illustrate this philosophy.

Brown-Forman has not made major  investments in overseas  distribution  networks
and mostly employs other spirits producers to distribute and market our products
outside the U.S. Although  consolidation  among spirits producers  theoretically
could hinder the  distribution  of our spirits  products in the future,  to date
this has rarely happened.  Other spirits companies  typically seek to distribute
our premium spirits and wine brands and we expect that demand to continue.

Our consumer durables segment includes fine china, crystal,  silver, and luggage
products  marketed under the Lenox,  Dansk,  Gorham,  Kirk Stieff,  and Hartmann
brand names.

                          Fiscal 2001 Compared to 2000

Net sales increased $16 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2001, fueled by gains in
catalogue, direct mail, and Internet channels.  Sales through traditional
wholesale channels softened during the last half of the fiscal year,
attributable to a weaker U.S. economy.  Hartmann, the smallest of the company's
consumer durables businesses, suffered an unusually difficult holiday season,
a trend that continued through the fourth quarter.

Gross profit for the segment  increased $13 million.  Gross margin improved from
49.3%  to  50.1%,  reflecting  an  improved  product  mix  and the  benefits  of
investments made to rationalize manufacturing capacity.

Advertising  expenses  were up 8%, due  primarily  to increased  advertising  of
collectible items.  Selling,  general, and administrative  expenses rose 3%, and
included  expenses of $1 million  incurred during the second half of the year to
improve  Hartmann's  future  performance.  Management of costs,  combined with a
reduction in required working capital, has helped boost returns for our consumer
durables segment.

Operating income improved 6% for the year. Strong growth in sales of collectible
items resulted in a fourth  consecutive year of double-digit  earnings gains for
Lenox. This performance was partially offset by a $5 million decline in earnings
at Hartmann. Hartmann is expected to return to profitability in fiscal 2002.


                          Fiscal 2000 Compared to 1999

Net  sales  increased  $29  million,  or 5%, as china,  crystal,  and  stainless
flatware  lines all  performed  strongly.  Several  casual  dinnerware  patterns
introduced  during the year were  particularly  successful,  including new lines
designed for seasonal use.  Revenues from the wholesale  channel  increased more
than 7%,  while  same-store  sales for  company-owned  stores rose 5%. The Lenox
Collections  direct marketing group continued to grow by reaching more consumers
through its successful  catalogue,  direct mail, and Internet  venues.  Hartmann
luggage also realized solid gains in sales and profits.

Gross  profit  increased  $14  million in fiscal  2000,  as gross  margins  held
constant across most product lines.

Advertising  expenses were up $4 million, due primarily to increased spending to
promote collectible items and new casual dinnerware patterns.  Selling, general,
and administrative  expenses rose 2%, reflecting the continuation of strong cost
control measures.

Operating income improved $6 million,  or 16%, with gains sourced broadly across
most product lines and channels of distribution.


                         LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our cash flows from operations continue to provide more than adequate capital to
meet operating and capital  expenditure  requirements,  pay dividends,  and fund
acquisition  opportunities.  We consider our ability to internally generate cash
to be a significant financial strength.

A consolidated statement of cash flows is summarized below:

Cash provided by operations  declined $10 million in fiscal 2001,  primarily due
to higher inventory levels in both business segments.  Cash used for investments
increased  significantly,   driven  by  the  acquisition  of  equity  stakes  in
Finlandia, Glenmorangie, and Tuaca.



Cash  provided by  operations  increased  $28 million in fiscal 2000,  primarily
reflecting higher net income and successful efforts to lower the working capital
requirements for our consumer durables business, offset partially by a reduction
in deferred income taxes.

We have  revolving  credit  agreements  for $100  million and $300  million that
expire  in fiscal  2002 and 2003,  respectively.  At April 30,  2001,  we had no
outstanding  borrowings under these  agreements.  At April 30, 2001, we had $220
million remaining on our $250 million shelf registration.


                              CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

We invested $46 million in property,  plant,  and equipment in fiscal 1999,  $78
million in fiscal 2000,  and $96 million in fiscal 2001.  An increase in capital
expenditures  primarily reflects the expansion and modernization of company-wide
production  facilities.  The company has been making significant  investments to
increase the capacity for distilling and warehousing Jack Daniel's  whiskey,  as
well as expanding our vineyard and winemaking capacity.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2002 are expected to approximate the fiscal 2001
level as we continue to expand the  capacity of our wine and spirits  production
facilities  in response  to growing  consumer  demand for our  premium  beverage
brands. Fiscal 2002 capital expenditure requirements are expected to be met with
internally generated funds.


                                    DIVIDENDS

Quarterly  dividends were increased 6% in fiscal 2001 to $0.33,  resulting in an
annualized  dividend of $1.32 per common  share.  This increase was based on the
expectation of continued  strong cash flow.  Cash dividends paid as a percentage
of net income were 39% in fiscal 1999, and 38% in fiscal years 2000 and 2001.


                                                  1999     2000     2001

                        DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

As a result of the growth of Brown-Forman's international business over the past
several  years,  the  company's  foreign  currency  receipts  exceed its foreign
currency  payments.  To the extent this foreign currency exposure is not hedged,
the  company's  results of  operations  and  financial  position are  negatively
impacted by a weakening of foreign  currencies  against the U.S.  dollar and are
positively impacted by a strengthening of the foreign currencies.

We use foreign  currency options and forward  contracts,  generally with average
maturities of less than one year, to protect  against the risk that the eventual
U.S.  dollar cash flows resulting from the sale and purchase of goods in foreign
currencies will be adversely  affected by changes in exchange rates. While these
hedging  instruments  are subject to  fluctuations in value from movement in the
foreign currency  exchange rates,  such fluctuations are offset by the change in
value of the underlying  exposures being hedged. We are not a party to leveraged
derivatives and do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

We had  outstanding  foreign  currency  option and  forward  contracts,  hedging
primarily European euro, British pound, and Japanese yen revenues, with notional
amounts  totaling $96 million,  $55 million,  and $98 million at April 30, 1999,
2000 and 2001,  respectively.  The company's  credit  exposure is limited to the
fair value of the contracts ($2 million, $4 million, and $4 million at April 30,
1999, 2000, and 2001,  respectively)  rather than the notional amounts. We enter
into foreign  currency  contracts only with major  financial  institutions  with
investment grade credit ratings, thereby decreasing the risk of credit loss.


                                  MARKET RISKS

The  company  holds  debt  obligations,  foreign  currency  forward  and  option
contracts,  and commodity future contracts that are exposed to risk from changes
in interest  rates,  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  and commodity  prices,
respectively.  We have established  policies,  procedures and internal processes
governing  the  management  of these market  risks.  As of April 30,  2001,  the
exposure to these market risks is not considered material.


                                  ENVIRONMENTAL

Along with other responsible  parties,  we face  environmental  claims resulting
from the cleanup of several waste deposit  sites.  We have accrued our estimated
portion of  cleanup  costs and expect  either the other  responsible  parties or
insurance to cover the remaining  costs.  We believe that any  additional  costs
incurred to satisfy environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect
on the company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

                            Brown-Forman Corporation
                 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY





                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    (Dollars expressed in millions, except per share and per option amounts)

1.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
- ---------------------------
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority-owned
subsidiaries.  Investments in affiliates in which the company has the ability to
exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for by the equity
method.  All other investments in affiliates are carried at cost.  Intercompany
transactions are eliminated.

Cash Equivalents
- ----------------
Cash  equivalents  include  demand  deposits  with banks and all  highly  liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Inventories
- -----------
Inventories  are  stated at the lower of cost or  market.  Approximately  85% of
consolidated inventories are valued using the last-in,  first-out (LIFO) method.
All remaining  inventories are valued using the first-in,  first-out and average
cost methods.

If the LIFO method had not been used,  inventories  would have been $110,  $110,
and $105 higher than reported at April 30, 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively.

A  substantial  portion of  barreled  whiskey  will not be sold  within one year
because of the duration of the aging process. All barreled whiskey is classified
as a current asset in accordance with industry  practice.  Bulk wine inventories
are classified as work in process.

Warehousing,  insurance, ad valorem taxes, and other carrying charges applicable
to barreled whiskey are included in inventory costs.

Long-Lived Assets
- -----------------
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Provision for depreciation is
made on the basis of estimated useful lives of depreciable  assets,  principally
using the straight-line method.

Intangible assets,  principally the excess of purchase price over the fair value
of  identifiable  net  assets of  acquired  businesses,  are stated at cost less
accumulated  amortization.  These assets are amortized  using the  straight-line
method over their estimated useful lives, not exceeding forty years.

Revenue Recognition
- -------------------
The company recognizes revenue when goods are shipped, which represents the time
that title to the goods and risk of loss passes to the customer.

Advertising Costs
- -----------------
Advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred, except for direct-response
advertising  costs,  which  are  capitalized  and  amortized  over  periods  not
exceeding one year.

Foreign Currency Translation
- ----------------------------
The  U.S.  dollar  is  the  functional  currency  for  substantially  all of the
company's consolidated  operations.  For these operations,  all gains and losses
from currency transactions are included in income currently. For certain foreign
equity  investments,   the  functional  currency  is  the  local  currency.  The
cumulative  translation  effects  for the equity  investments  using  functional
currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in the cumulative translation
adjustment in stockholders' equity.

Earnings Per Share
- ------------------
Basic  earnings per share (basic EPS) is calculated  using net income reduced by
dividends on preferred  stock,  divided by the weighted average number of common
shares  outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share (diluted EPS) is
calculated  in the same  manner,  except  that  the  denominator  also  includes
additional  common  shares  that would  have been  issued if  outstanding  stock
options had been  exercised,  as determined by application of the treasury stock
method.

On October 1, 1998, the company redeemed all 1,177,948 outstanding shares of its
preferred  stock for  $10.25  per  share.  The  $0.25  per  share  excess of the
redemption  cost over the carrying  amount of the preferred  shares was deducted
from net income to determine net income applicable to common stock for 1999.

Treasury Stock
- --------------
As of April 30, 2001,  the company  holds  approximately  537,000  shares of its
Class B common stock as treasury stock.  The company intends to use these shares
to satisfy future exercises of employee stock options.

Use of Estimates
- ----------------
The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities;  disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.  Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

Reclassifications
- -----------------
Certain  prior year amounts have been  reclassified  to conform with the current
year presentation.

Other
- -----
In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
No.  133,  "Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities."
Statement  No. 133 requires that all  derivatives  be measured at fair value and
recognized in the balance sheet as either assets or  liabilities.  Statement No.
133 also  requires  that  changes in a  derivative's  fair  value be  recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special
accounting  for  qualifying  hedges  allows a  derivative's  gains and losses to
offset related  results on the hedged item in the income  statement and requires
formal  documentation,  designation,  and  assessment  of the  effectiveness  of
derivatives that receive hedge accounting.

Statement No. 133, as amended by Statements  No. 137 and 138, was adopted by the
company as of May 1, 2001.  The adoption  did not have a material  impact on the
company's consolidated financial statements.



2.  ACQUISITIONS
In April  1999,  the  company  acquired a  majority  interest  in  Sonoma-Cutrer
Vineyards,  Inc. for $69,  net of $32 of monetary  assets (cash and tax benefits
receivable, offset by assumed debt) received. The company acquired the remaining
interests for $27 and $3 during 2000 and 2001, respectively. The acquisition has
been accounted for as a purchase.  The excess of the acquisition  costs over the
fair value of the  identifiable  tangible and intangible net assets acquired was
$39, which is being amortized over forty years.

On May 17, 2000,  the company  reached an  agreement  with  Glenmorangie  plc to
expand the company's sales and marketing of the  Glenmorangie and Ardberg Single
Malt Scotch  brands  from the U.S.  to certain  additional  global  markets.  In
connection with this  arrangement,  the company  purchased  shares  representing
approximately  22% of the equity of Glenmorangie  plc at a cost of $15. The cost
of the acquisition,  which was accounted for as a purchase, was not in excess of
the fair value of the identifiable  tangible and intangible net assets that were
acquired.

On June 15, 2000, the company agreed to form a global  alliance with Altia Group
Ltd to market and sell Finlandia Vodka.  Brown-Forman  acquired 45% of Finlandia
Vodka Worldwide Ltd (FVW), which owns the Finlandia  trademark and the rights to
market  Finlandia  Vodka,  at  a  purchase  price  of  approximately   $84.  The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. The excess of the acquisition costs
over the fair  value of the  identifiable  tangible  and  intangible  net assets
acquired  was  $75,  which is being  amortized  over  forty  years.  During  the
three-year  period  ending  December 31, 2006,  Brown-Forman  may be required to
acquire all or some of Altia's remaining 55% interest in FVW. Acquisition of the
entire 55% remaining interest would cost 638 Finnish marks (approximately $91 at
April 30, 2001) plus interest of 4.5% per year from the initial purchase date.

3. COMMITMENTS
Rental  payments  for  real  estate,   vehicles,   and  office,   computer,  and
manufacturing  equipment under operating leases amounted to approximately $28 in
1999,  $26 in  2000,  and $28 in  2001.  The  company  has  commitments  related
primarily to minimum lease  payments of $24 in 2002,  $16 in 2003,  $12 in 2004,
$10 in 2005, $6 in 2006, and $33 thereafter.

The company has contracted  with various growers and wineries to supply portions
of its future grape and bulk wine  requirements.  While most of these  contracts
call for prices to be determined by market conditions, certain contracts provide
for minimum purchase prices.

4.  CREDIT FACILITIES
The  company  has  revolving   credit   agreements  with  various  domestic  and
international  banks  for $100 and $300 that  expire  in  fiscal  2002 and 2003,
respectively.  The most  restrictive of the agreements'  covenants  requires the
company to maintain a minimum level of net worth.  At April 30, 2001,  net worth
exceeded the required level, as defined in the agreements, by $837. At April 30,
2001, the company had no outstanding borrowings under these agreements. At April
30, 2000,  the company also had available  for issuance $220 of debt  securities
under a shelf registration.

5. DEBT
The company's long-term debt consisted of the following:

April 30,                                1999      2000      2001

                                       --------------------------
                                         $ 53      $ 41      $ 40
                                       ==========================

No  long-term  debt  payments are  required  until  fiscal  2006.  Cash paid for
interest was $11 in 1999,  $15 in 2000,  and $16 in 2001.  The weighted  average
interest  rates on commercial  paper were 4.9% at April 30, 1999,  6.1% at April
30, 2000, and 4.8% at April 30, 2001. The weighted average interest rates on the
variable rate  industrial  revenue bonds were 4.1%,  5.2%, and 4.3% at April 30,
1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively.

6. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The company uses foreign currency options and forward contracts,  generally with
average  maturities of less than one year,  as protection  against the risk that
the  eventual  U.S.  dollar cash flows  resulting  from the sale and purchase of
goods in foreign  currencies  will be adversely  affected by changes in exchange
rates. While these hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value from
movement in the foreign currency exchange rates, such fluctuations are offset by
the change in value of the underlying exposures being hedged. The company is not
a  party  to  leveraged  derivatives  and  does  not  hold  or  issue  financial
instruments for trading purposes.

The company  had  outstanding  foreign  currency  option and forward  contracts,
hedging primarily European euro, British pound, and Japanese yen revenues,  with
notional  amounts  totaling $96, $55, and $98 at April 30, 1999, 2000, and 2001,
respectively.  The company's credit exposure is limited to the fair value of the
contracts  (see Note 7)  rather  than the  notional  amounts.  Foreign  currency
contracts are entered into with major  financial  institutions  with  investment
grade credit ratings, thereby decreasing the risk of credit loss.



7.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of cash and cash  equivalents and commercial  paper  approximates
the carrying amount due to the short maturities of these  instruments.  The fair
value of long-term debt is estimated  using  discounted  cash flows based on the
company's incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowings.  The fair
value of  foreign  currency  contracts  is  based on  quoted  market  prices.  A
comparison of the fair values and carrying  amounts of these  instruments  is as
follows:

                                     2000                        2000

Deferred income taxes were not provided on undistributed  earnings ($133,  $136,
and $149 at April 30, 1999,  2000, and 2001,  respectively)  of certain  foreign
subsidiaries  because such undistributed  earnings are expected to be reinvested
indefinitely   overseas.  If  these  amounts  were  not  considered  permanently
reinvested,  additional  deferred taxes of approximately $28, $30, and $33 would
have been provided in 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively.

Cash paid for income taxes was $150 in 1999, $174 in 2000, and $131 in 2001.

rates would have increased the accumulated  postretirement benefit obligation as
of April 30, 2001 by $5 and the aggregate service and interest costs for 2001 by
$1. A one  percentage  point  decrease  in assumed  health care cost trend rates
would have decreased the  accumulated  postretirement  benefit  obligation as of

11. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION
The  company  is  organized  into two  operating  segments,  as  defined by FASB
Statement No. 131,  "Disclosures  about  Segments of an  Enterprise  and Related
Information"  -- wine and  spirits,  and consumer  durables.  These two segments
reflect  the two  categories  of  products  from which the  company  derives its
revenues. The wine and spirits segment includes the production,  importing,  and
marketing of wines and distilled spirits. The consumer durables segment includes
the manufacture and sale of china,  crystal,  ceramic and crystal  collectibles,
silver, luggage, and leather accessories.

The accounting  policies of the segments are the same as the policies  described
in Note 1. There are no intersegment revenues.

The following tables reconcile  segment  operating results and asset information
to consolidated amounts.

Net sales are attributed to countries based on location of customer.  Long-lived

12.  CONTINGENCIES
In the normal course of business,  various suits and claims are brought  against
the company,  some of which seek  significant  damages.  Many of these suits and
claims take years to  adjudicate,  and it is difficult to predict their outcome.
In the opinion of management,  based on advice from legal counsel, none of these
suits  or  claims  will  have  a  material   adverse  effect  on  the  company's
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

13.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The company,  along with other responsible  parties,  faces environmental claims
resulting  from the  cleanup of several  waste  deposit  sites.  The company has
accrued its estimated  portion of cleanup  costs and expects  other  responsible
parties and insurance to cover the remaining  costs.  The company  believes that
any  additional  costs it incurs will not have a material  adverse effect on the
company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

14. STOCK OPTIONS
Under the Brown-Forman  Corporation  Omnibus  Compensation  Plan (the Plan), the
company may grant stock  options and other  stock-based  incentive  awards for a
total of 3,400,000 shares of common stock to eligible  employees until April 30,
2005.  All shares  delivered  under the Plan will be issued from treasury  stock
acquired by the company.

Stock  options are granted at an exercise  price of not less than the fair value
of the underlying  stock on the date of the grant.  Except for the stock options
granted on September 1, 1999,  discussed below,  stock options granted under the
Plan generally become  exercisable  after a period of three years from the first
day of the fiscal  year of grant and expire  seven  years  thereafter.  The fair
values of the options granted during 1999,  2000, and 2001 were $13.74,  $16.37,
and $14.38 per  option,  respectively.  Fair  values  were  estimated  using the
Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions:

                                      1999      2000      2001
- --------------------------------------------------------------
Risk-free interest rate               5.5%      5.9%      6.2%
Expected volatility                  17.4%     21.6%     24.0%
Expected dividend yield               2.2%      2.2%      2.2%
Expected life (years)                   6         6         6

On September 1, 1999,  the company made a special grant of 486,250 stock options
with an exercise  price of $100 per share,  which become  exercisable  on May 1,
2006 and expire on September 1, 2007.  The fair value of these options was $5.77
per  option,   using  the   Black-Scholes   pricing  model  with  the  following
assumptions: a risk-free interest rate of 6.0%, expected volatility of 18.0%, an
expected dividend yield of 2.2%, and an expected life of 8 years.

As of April 30, 2001,  no other  stock-based  awards have been granted under the
Plan.

The company applies Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees," and related  interpretations in accounting for stock
options.   Accordingly,   no  compensation  expense  has  been  recognized.  Had
compensation  expense for the stock  options been  determined  based on the fair
value at the grant dates  consistent with the methodology  prescribed under FASB
Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation," the company's net
income would have been reduced by $1.5 in 1999,  $2.6 in 2000, and $3.2 in 2001.
The  company's  basic and diluted  earnings per share would have been reduced by
$0.02 per share in 1999, $0.04 per share in 2000, and $0.05 per share in 2001.

                              REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

We are  responsible for the  presentation  of the  information  contained in the
consolidated  financial  statements and for its integrity and  objectivity.  Our
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally  accepted  accounting
principles  and include  amounts based on our best  estimates and judgments with
appropriate  consideration  given to  materiality.  We also prepared the related
financial  information and are responsible for its accuracy and consistency with
the financial statements.

The    consolidated     financial    statements    have    been    audited    by
PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP, independent accountants.  We have made available to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP all the company's financial records and related data,
as well as the  minutes  of  stockholders',  directors',  and other  appropriate
meetings.   Furthermore,   we   believe   that  all   representations   made  to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during the audit were valid and appropriate.

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal control
designed to provide  reasonable  assurance  at  reasonable  cost that  financial
records are  reliable for  preparing  financial  statements  and that assets are
properly  accounted  for and  safeguarded.  The company  has an  internal  audit
function that is intended to provide a review and monitoring process that allows
the company to be reasonably sure that the system of internal  control  operates
effectively.  In  addition,  as part of the audit of the  financial  statements,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP completed a study and evaluation of selected internal
accounting controls to establish a basis for reliance thereon in determining the
nature,  timing, and extent of audit tests to be applied. We have considered the
internal auditors' and  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP's recommendations concerning
the system of internal  control and have taken actions that we believe are cost-
effective   in   the   circumstances   to   respond   appropriately   to   these
recommendations.  We believe that as of April 30,  2001,  the system of internal
control is adequate to accomplish the objectives discussed herein.

We also recognize our  responsibility  for fostering a strong ethical climate so
that the company's  affairs are conducted  according to the highest standards of
personal  and  corporate  conduct.  This  responsibility  is  characterized  and
reflected in the company's Code of Conduct and Compliance Guidelines,  which set
forth the company's compliance program. The compliance program addresses,  among
other things, the necessity of ensuring open communication  through the company;
the  disclosure  of potential  conflict of  interest;  the  compliance  with all
applicable  domestic and foreign  laws,  including  those  relating to financial
disclosure;   and  the  maintenance  of  the   confidentiality   of  proprietary
information.  The company has a systematic program for assessing compliance with
these  standards,  including  a review  by the Audit  Committee  of the Board of
Directors.

The  Board of  Directors,  through  its  Audit  Committee,  composed  solely  of
directors  who are not  employees of the  company,  meets with  management,  the
internal  auditors,  and the  independent  accountants  to  ensure  that each is
properly  discharging  its  respective  responsibilities.  Both the  independent
accountants and the internal  auditors have free access to the Audit  Committee,
without  management  present,  to discuss the  results of their work,  including
internal accounting controls and the quality of financial reporting.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


BROWN-FORMAN CORPORATION

In our opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets and the related
consolidated  statements of income,  of  stockholders'  equity and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Brown-Forman
Corporation and  Subsidiaries  ("the Company") at April 30, 1999, 2000 and 2001,
and the results of their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the  period  ended  April  30,  2001,  in  conformity  with  accounting
principles  generally accepted in the United States of America.  These financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management;   our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.  We conducted  our audits of these  statements  in  accordance  with
auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the United States of America,  which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about
whether the financial  statements  are free of material  misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
