PART I

Item 1.  Business

Ball Corporation was organized in
1880 and incorporated in Indiana in 1922. Its principal executive offices are located at
10 Longs Peak Drive, Broomfield, Colorado 80021-2510. The terms
“Ball,” “the company,” “we” and “our” as used
herein refer to Ball Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Ball is a manufacturer of metal and
plastic packaging, primarily for beverages and foods, and a supplier of aerospace and
other technologies and services to government and commercial customers.

Information Pertaining
to the Business of the Company

The company’s businesses are
comprised of three segments: (1) North American packaging, (2) international
packaging and (3) aerospace and technologies.

North American Packaging

Our principal business in North
America is the manufacture and sale of aluminum, steel and polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) containers, primarily for beverages and foods. This segment represented
65 percent of Ball’s consolidated net sales in 2004.

A substantial part of our North
American packaging sales are made directly to companies in packaged beverage and food
businesses, including SABMiller and bottlers of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola branded beverages
and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups. Sales to SABMiller plc
and PepsiCo, Inc., represented approximately 11 percent and 9 percent of
Ball’s consolidated net sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31,
2004. Additional details about sales to major customers are included in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements, which can be found in Item 8 of this
Form 10-K (“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”).

Packaging products are sold in highly
competitive markets, primarily based on quality, service and price. The packaging business
is capital intensive, requiring significant investment in machinery and equipment.
Profitability is sensitive to selling prices, production volumes, labor, freight, utility
and warehousing costs, as well as the availability and price of raw materials, such as
aluminum, steel, plastic resin and other direct materials. These raw materials are
generally available from several sources and we have secured what we consider to be
adequate supplies and are not experiencing any shortages. We believe we have limited our
exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum, steel and plastic resin as a result
of (1) the inclusion of provisions in most aluminum container sales contracts to pass
through aluminum cost changes, as well as the use of derivative instruments, (2) the
inclusion of provisions in certain steel container sales contracts to pass through steel cost
changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that
incorporate annually negotiated metal costs and (3) the inclusion of provisions in substantially all plastic
container sales contracts to pass through resin cost changes. In 2004 we were able to pass
through steel surcharges levied by producers and we are currently in negotiations with
respect to 2005 steel price increases. We believe these negotiations will result in the pass
through of the majority of the 2005 steel price increases. At the same time, we are
attempting to reduce manufacturing and other material costs as much as possible. While
raw materials and energy sources, such as natural gas and electricity, may from time to time be in
short supply or unavailable due to external factors, and the  pass through of steel costs to our customers
may be limited in some instances, we cannot predict the effects, if
any, of such occurrences on future operations.

Research and development (R&D)
efforts in the North American packaging segment are directed toward the development of new
sizes and types of metal and plastic beverage and food containers, as well as new uses for
the current containers. Other research and development efforts in this segment generally
seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies. During 2004 we completed our expansion of the
Ball Technology and Innovation Center located near Denver, Colorado. All of our North American R&D
activities are now conducted in that facility.

North American Metal
Beverage Containers

North American metal beverage
containers represent Ball’s largest product line, accounting for 67 percent of
segment net sales and 44 percent of consolidated net sales in 2004. Decorated
two-piece aluminum beverage cans are produced at 16 manufacturing facilities in the
U.S., one facility in Canada and one in Puerto Rico. Can ends are produced within four of
the U.S. facilities, as well as in a fifth facility that manufactures only ends. Our
annual production capacity is approximately 32 billion cans. Metal beverage containers are
primarily sold under multi-year supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks,
beer and other beverages. Sales volumes of metal beverage containers in North America tend
to be highest during the period from April through September.

Through Rocky Mountain Metal
Container, LLC, a 50/50 joint venture, which is accounted for as an equity investment,
Ball and Coors Brewing Company (Coors), a wholly owned subsidiary of Molson Coors Brewing
Company, participate in beverage can and end manufacturing facilities in Golden, Colorado.
The joint venture supplies Coors with beverage cans and ends for its Golden, Colorado, and
Memphis, Tennessee, breweries and supplies ends to its Shenandoah, Virginia, filling
location. Ball receives management fees and technology licensing fees under agreements
with the joint venture. In addition to beverage containers supplied to Coors from the
joint venture, Ball supplies, from its own facilities, substantially all of Coors’ metal
container requirements for its Shenandoah, Virginia, filling location, as well as
other containers not manufactured by the joint venture.

Based on publicly available industry
information, we estimate that our North American metal beverage container shipments were
approximately 31 percent of total U.S. and Canadian shipments for metal beverage
containers. Three producers manufacture substantially all of the remaining metal beverage
containers. Two of these producers and three other independent producers also manufacture
metal beverage containers in Mexico. Available information indicates that North American
metal beverage container shipments have been relatively flat during the past several
years.

Beverage container production
capacity in the U.S., Canada and Mexico exceeds demand. In order to more closely balance capacity
and demand within our business, from time to time we consolidate our can and end
manufacturing capacity into fewer, more efficient facilities. From January 1, 1999,
through December 31, 2001, we closed five plants. In the second quarter of 2003, we
closed a beverage end plant which we acquired from Metal Packaging International, Inc., in
March 2003. We also attempt to efficiently match capacity with the changes in customer
demand for our packaging products. To that end, we are converting a beverage can
manufacturing line in our Golden, Colorado, plant from the production of 12-ounce beverage
cans to 24-ounce beverage cans. The Golden line conversion is expected to be completed
during the second quarter of 2005.

The aluminum beverage container continues
to compete aggressively with other packaging materials in the beer and soft drink
industries. The glass bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry, while
soft drink industry use of PET containers has grown. In Canada, metal beverage containers
have captured significantly lower percentages of the packaged beverage industry than in
the U.S., particularly in the packaged beer industry.

North American Metal Food
Containers

In addition to metal beverage
containers, Ball produces two-piece and three-piece steel food containers for packaging
vegetables, fruit, soups, meat, seafood, nutritional products, pet food and other
products. These containers are manufactured in 12 plants in the U.S. and Canada and
sold primarily to food processors in North America. In 2004 metal food container sales
comprised approximately 22 percent of segment net sales and 14 percent of
consolidated net sales. Sales volumes of metal food containers in North America tend to be
highest from June through October as a result of seasonal vegetable and salmon packs.
Approximately 33 billion steel food containers were shipped in the U.S. and Canada in
2004, approximately 21 percent of which we estimate were shipped by Ball.

On March 17, 2004, Ball acquired
ConAgra Grocery Products Company’s (ConAgra) interest in Ball Western Can Company LLC
(Ball Western Can) located in Oakdale, California. Prior to the acquisition, Ball Western
Can was a 50/50 joint venture between Ball and ConAgra and was accounted for under the
equity method of accounting. The acquisition of Ball Western Can added approximately one
billion units of annual capacity.

Competitors in the metal food
container business include two national and a few regional suppliers and self
manufacturers. Several producers in Mexico also manufacture steel food containers. Steel
food containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food industry including
glass, aluminum, plastic, paper and the stand-up pouch. As a result, demand for this
product line may be affected during the next few years and this segment must increasingly
focus on product innovation and cost reduction. Service, quality and price are among the
key competitive factors.

North American Plastic
Containers

PET containers represented
approximately 11 percent of segment net sales and 7 percent of consolidated net
sales in 2004. Demand for containers made of PET has increased in the beverage and food
markets, with improved barrier technologies and other advances. This growth in demand
should continue, assuming adequate supplies of resin continue to be available. While PET
beverage containers compete against metal, glass and paper, the historical increase in the
sales of PET containers has come primarily at the expense of glass containers and through
new market introductions. We estimate our 2004 shipments of 5 billion plastic
containers to be approximately 8 percent of total U.S. and Canadian plastic container
shipments.

The company operates five PET
facilities in the U.S. Competition in the PET container industry includes several national
and regional suppliers and self-manufacturers. Service, quality and price are important
competitive factors. The ability to produce customized, differentiated plastic containers
is becoming a key competitive factor.

Most of Ball’s PET containers
are sold under long-term contracts to suppliers of bottled water and carbonated soft
drinks, including bottlers of Pepsi-Cola branded beverages and their affiliates that
utilize consolidated purchasing groups. Our plastic beer containers are being tested by
several of our customers and we are developing plastic containers for the single serve
juice market. We have expanded our line of Heat-Tek(TM) PET plastic bottles for hot-filled
beverages, adding sizes from 8 ounces to 64 ounces.

International Packaging

Europe

Ball Packaging Europe’s
operations, which accounted for 20 percent of Ball’s consolidated net sales in
2004, consist of nine beverage can plants and two aluminum beverage can end plants, a
technical center in Bonn, Germany, and the European headquarters in Ratingen, Germany. Of
the 11 plants, four are located in Germany, three in the United Kingdom, two in
France and one each in the Netherlands and Poland. In total the plants produced
approximately 11 billion cans in 2004, with approximately half of those being
produced from steel and half from aluminum. Four of the can plants use steel only, four
use aluminum and one plant uses both metals.

Ball Packaging Europe is the second
largest metal beverage container producer in Europe, with an approximate 30 percent
of European shipments, and produces two-piece beverage cans and can ends for producers of
beer, carbonated soft drinks, mineral water, fruit juices, energy drinks, isotonics, milk-based
beverages, coffee drinks and alcoholic mixed drinks. In western Europe, Ball Packaging
Europe is the top metal beverage container manufacturer in Germany, France and the Benelux
countries and the second largest metal beverage container manufacturer in the United Kingdom. In
addition, it has contributed to the development of the eastern European beverage business
and is the second largest metal beverage container manufacturer in Poland. In 2004 Ball began
construction on a new aluminum beverage can manufacturing plant in Belgrade, Serbia, to
serve the growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern Europe. This plant is
expected to commence production in the second quarter of 2005.

As in North America, the metal
beverage container continues to compete aggressively with other packaging materials used by the
European beer and soft drink industries. The glass bottle is heavily utilized in the
packaged beer industry, while the PET container is increasingly utilized in the soft
drink, juice and mineral water industries.

Our European beverage container business
has a balanced and stable customer base with 10 customers accounting for approximately 65
percent of its net sales. Ball Packaging Europe’s major customers include Coca-Cola,
Inbev, Molson Coors, Heineken, Bavaria, SABMiller, Britvic and Diageo (Guinness).

Beverage packaging in Germany is
subject to a mandatory deposit fee on cans and other non-refillable containers. Due to
political and legal uncertainties surrounding the mandatory deposit in Germany, no
nationwide system for returning the containers was in place when the deposit was imposed
on January 1, 2003. As a result, nearly all retailers stopped carrying beverages in
non-refillable containers. Subsequently, several small return systems have been put in
place instead of one generally accepted return system and no broad solution has been put
forth. On October 15, 2004, the German parliament adopted a proposal leaving the existing
deposit of 25 eurocents per container in effect. This decision, however, was ruled not in
compliance with the European Union (EU) law, and therefore does not provide a stable legal
situation to which the industry can adapt. The outcome of the legal proceedings of the EU
Commission is unclear and the political discussions about the deposit continue. We have
responded by reducing beverage can production at our German plants, implementing
aggressive cost reduction measures and increasing exports from Germany to other European
countries.

The European beverage can business is
capital intensive, requiring significant investments in machinery and equipment.
Profitability is sensitive to selling prices, foreign exchange rates, production volumes,
labor and the costs and availability of certain raw materials, such as aluminum and steel.
The European aluminum and steel industries are highly consolidated with three steel
suppliers and three aluminum suppliers providing 95 percent of European requirements.
Material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year, although Ball Packaging
Europe has negotiated some longer term agreements. Aluminum is purchased primarily in U.S.
dollars while the functional currencies of Ball Packaging Europe and its subsidiaries are
non-U.S. dollars. This inherently results in a foreign exchange rate risk, which the
company minimizes through the use of derivative contracts.

R&D efforts in Europe are
directed toward the development of new sizes and types of metal containers, as well as new
uses for the current containers. Other research and development efforts in this segment
include improving manufacturing efficiencies. The European R&D activities are
conducted in a technical center located in Bonn, Germany.

Other International

Through Ball Asia Pacific Limited, we
are one of the largest beverage can manufacturers in the People’s Republic of China
(PRC) and believe that our facilities are among the most modern in that country.
Capacity grew rapidly in the PRC, resulting in a supply/demand imbalance to which we have
responded in recent years by closing facilities. Our current operations include the
manufacture of aluminum cans and ends in three plants and high-density plastic containers
in two plants. Sales in the PRC represented 3 percent of consolidated net sales. We
also participate in joint ventures that manufacture aluminum cans and ends in Brazil and
in the PRC. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts
in respect of a receivable of a 35-percent owned joint venture in the PRC.

For more information on Ball’s
international operations, see Item 2, Properties, and Exhibit 21, Subsidiary List.

Aerospace and
Technologies

The aerospace and technologies
segment includes defense operations, civil space systems and commercial space operations.
The defense operations business unit includes defense systems, systems engineering
services, advanced antenna and video systems and electro-optics and cryogenic systems and
components. Sales in the aerospace and technologies segment accounted for approximately 12
percent of consolidated net sales in 2004.

The majority of the aerospace and
technologies segment business involves work under contracts, generally from one to five
years in duration, as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA), the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other U.S.
government agencies. Contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government
represented approximately 82 percent and 96 percent of segment sales in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The percentage representing U.S. government sales decreased in 2004 due to growing revenues related
to the WorldView contract. Geopolitical events and executive and legislative branch priorities have
yielded considerable growth opportunities in areas matching our core capabilities. However,
consolidation in the aerospace and defense industries continues, and there is strong competition
for new business.

Civil space systems, defense systems
and commercial space operations include hardware, software and services sold primarily to
U.S. customers, with emphasis on space science and exploration, environmental and Earth
sciences, and defense and intelligence applications. Major contractual activities
frequently involve the design, manufacture and testing of satellites, remote sensors and
ground station control hardware and software, as well as related services such as launch
vehicle integration and satellite operations.

Other hardware activities include:
target identification, warning and attitude control systems and components; cryogenic
systems for reactant storage, and sensor cooling devices using either closed-cycle
mechanical refrigerators or open-cycle solid and liquid cryogens; star trackers, which are
general-purpose stellar attitude sensors; and fast-steering mirrors. Additionally, the
aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to
government agencies, prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of
information warfare, electronic warfare, avionics, intelligence, training and space
systems needs.

Backlog in the aerospace and
technologies segment was $694 million and $644 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, and consists of the aggregate contract value of firm orders, excluding
amounts previously recognized as revenue. The 2004 backlog includes $502 million
expected to be recognized in revenues during 2005, with the remainder expected to be
recognized in revenues thereafter. Unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm
government orders which are subject to annual funding were $393 million and
$443 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Year-to-year
comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations.

The company’s aerospace and
technologies segment has contracts with the U.S. government or its contractors which have
standard termination provisions. The government retains the right to terminate contracts
at its convenience. However, if contracts are terminated in this manner, Ball is entitled
to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work performed through the
date of termination. U.S. government contracts are also subject to reduction or
modification in the event of changes in government requirements or budgetary constraints.

Patents

In the opinion of the company, none
of its active patents is essential to the successful operation of its business as a whole.

Research and
Development

Note 18, “Research and
Development,” in the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report,
contains information on company research and development activity. Additional information
is also included in Item 2, “Properties,” below.

Environment

Aluminum, steel and PET containers
are recyclable, and significant amounts of used containers are being diverted from the
solid waste stream and recycled. Using the most recent data available, in 2003
approximately 50 percent of aluminum containers, 60 percent of steel containers
and 20 percent of the PET containers sold in the U.S. were recycled.

Recycling rates vary throughout
Europe, but generally average 60 percent for aluminum and steel containers, which
exceeds the European Union’s goal of 50 percent recycling for metals. Due in
part to the intrinsic value of aluminum and steel, metal packaging compares favorably to
other packaging materials in terms of recycling in Europe. Some of the highest rates are
in Germany where both aluminum and steel containers were recycled at rates estimated to be
at least 80 percent prior to the imposition of mandatory deposits on one-way packaging
effective January 1, 2003.

Compliance with federal, state and
local laws relating to protection of the environment has not had a material, adverse
effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the company. As
more fully described under Item 3, Legal Proceedings, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency and various state environmental agencies have designated the company as a
potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of
several hazardous waste sites. However, the company’s information at this time
indicates that these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity,
results of operations or financial condition of the company.

Legislation which would prohibit, tax
or restrict the sale or use of certain types of containers, and would require diversion of
solid wastes such as packaging materials from disposal in landfills, has been or may be
introduced anywhere we operate. While container legislation has been adopted in some
jurisdictions, similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative
bodies in numerous others. The company anticipates that continuing efforts will be made to
consider and adopt such legislation in many jurisdictions in the future. If such
legislation were widely adopted, it potentially could have a material adverse effect on the
business of the company, as well as on the container manufacturing industry generally, in
view of the company’s substantial global sales and investment in metal and PET
container manufacturing. However, the packages we produce are widely used and perform well
in U.S. states and Canadian provinces that have deposit systems.

Employees

At the end of December 2004 the
company employed approximately 13,200 people worldwide, including 9,100 employees in
the U.S. and 4,100 in other countries. There are also approximately
1,000 employees employed in unconsolidated joint ventures in which Ball participates.
Approximately one-third of Ball's North American packaging plant employees are unionized and most of our European
plant employees are union workers. Collective bargaining agreements with various unions in the U.S. have terms of
three to five years, expire at regular intervals and are customarily renewed in the ordinary course after
bargaining between union and company representatives. The company believes that its employee relations are good
and that its training, education and retention practices assist in enhancing employee satisfaction levels.

Brazil.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

North America

As previously reported, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) considers the company a Potentially Responsible
Party (PRP) with respect to the Lowry Landfill site located east of Denver, Colorado. On
June 12, 1992, the company was served with a lawsuit filed by the City and County of
Denver (Denver) and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc., seeking contributions from the
company and approximately 38 other companies. The company filed its answer denying the
allegations of the Complaint. On July 8, 1992, the company was served with a third-party
complaint filed by S.W. Shattuck Chemical Company, Inc., seeking contribution from the
company and other companies for the costs associated with cleaning up the Lowry Landfill.
The company denied the allegations of the complaints.

In July 1992 the company entered into
a settlement and indemnification agreement with Chemical Waste Management, Inc., and Waste
Management of Colorado, Inc. (collectively Waste Management) and Denver pursuant to which
Waste Management and Denver dismissed their lawsuit against the company and Waste
Management agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the company from claims and
lawsuits brought by governmental agencies and other parties relating to actions seeking
contributions or remedial costs from the company for the cleanup of the site. Several
other companies, which are defendants in the above-referenced lawsuits, had already
entered into the settlement and indemnification agreement with Waste Management and
Denver. Waste Management, Inc., has agreed to guarantee the obligations for Chemical Waste
Management, Inc., and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. Waste Management and Denver may
seek additional payments from the company if the response costs related to the site exceed
$319 million. In 2003 Waste Management, Inc., indicated that the cost of the site might
exceed $319 million in 2030, approximately three years before the projected completion of
the project. The company might also be responsible for payments (based on 1992 dollars)
for any additional wastes which may have been disposed of by the company at the site but
which are identified after the execution of the settlement agreement.

At this time, there are no Lowry
Landfill actions in which the company is actively involved. Based on the information
available to the company at this time, the company does not believe that this matter will
have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial
condition of the company.

The company previously reported that,
on August 1, 1997, the USEPA sent notice of potential liability to 19 PRPs concerning past
activities at one or more of the four Rocky Flats parcels (including land owned by
Precision Chemicals now owned by Great Western Inorganics) at the Rocky Flats Industrial
Park site (RFIP) located in Jefferson County, Colorado. The RFIP site also includes the
American Ecological Recycling and Research Company (AERRCO) site and a site owned by Thoro
Products Company. Based upon sampling at the site in 1996, the USEPA determined that
additional site work would be required to determine the extent of contamination and the
possible cleanup of the site. The USEPA requested the PRPs to perform certain site work in
1996. On December 19, 1997, the USEPA issued an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to
conduct engineering estimates and cost analyses. The company has funded approximately
$70,000 toward these costs. The PRPs have negotiated an agreement and the company
contributed $5,000 as an initial group contribution. The company has agreed to pay 12
percent of the costs of cleanup at the AERRCO site and a percentage of the cleanup costs
on the Thoro site. On January 8, 2003, and October 9, 2003, the company made additional
payments of $97,200 (total $194,400) toward the cost of cleanup. The company paid $35,355
in 2004 toward the cleanup. Based on the information, or lack thereof, available to the
company at the present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a
material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition
of the company.

As previously reported, in October
2001 representatives of Vauxmont Intermountain Communities (Vauxmont) notified six of the
PRPs at the AERRCO site, including the company, (AERRCO PRPs) that hazardous materials
might have contaminated property owned by Vauxmont. The AERRCO site is contained within
the RFIP site. Vauxmont also alleges that it lost $7 million on a contract with a home
developer for the purchase of a portion of the land. Vauxmont representatives requested
that the AERRCO PRPs study any contamination to the Vauxmont real estate. The AERRCO PRPs
agreed to undertake such a study and sought the USEPA’s final approval. The sampling
results were made available to all parties. No further claims have been made against the
company by Vauxmont to date. Based on the information, or lack thereof, available to the
company at the present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a
material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition
of the company.

As previously reported, during July
1992, the company received information that it had been named a PRP with respect to the
Solvents Recovery of New England Site (SRSNE) located in Southington, Connecticut.
According to the information received, it is alleged that the company contributed
approximately 0.08816 percent of the waste contributed to the site on a volumetric basis.
The PRP group has been involved in negotiations with the USEPA regarding the remediation
of the site. The company has paid approximately $17,500 toward site investigation and
remediation efforts. The PRP group spent $15 million through the end of 2001.
Approximately $1.5 million more was spent to complete a Remedial Investigation and
Feasibility Study (RI/FS) and pay for remediation work through 2003. As of December 2001,
projected remediation cost estimates for a bioremediation and enhanced oxidation system
ranged from $20 million to $30 million. The PRP group offered a $5.5 million settlement to
resolve the USEPA claim of $16 million for past costs at the SRSNE site. PRP/USEPA
negotiations to resolve the past cost claims from the USEPA have not been resolved and are
not being actively pursued by the PRP group. A natural resources damage claim of
approximately $3 million is anticipated. Based on the information, or lack thereof,
available to the company at the present time, the company does not believe that this
matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or
financial condition of the company.

The company previously reported that
on or about June 14, 1990, the El Monte plant of Ball-InCon Glass Packaging Corp.
(renamed Ball Glass Container Corporation [Ball Glass] in 1994), a then wholly owned
subsidiary of the company, the assets of which were contributed in September 1995 into a
joint venture with Compagnie de Saint-Gobain (Saint-Gobain), now known as Saint-Gobain
Industries, Inc., and currently wholly owned by Saint-Gobain, received a general
notification letter and information request from the EPA, Region IX. The letter notified
Ball Glass that it may have a potential liability as defined in Section 107(a) of the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) with respect
to the San Gabriel Valley areas 1-4 Superfund Sites located in Los Angeles County,
California. Other companies received a similar letter and request. The PRP group organized
and drafted an agreement, which Ball Glass executed. The PRP group and the EPA negotiated
the terms of an AOC, which was subsequently revised and finalized with the consent of the
EPA. The remedy AOC was filed with the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles effective
April 21, 2004, four days after the public comment period expired. On June 21,
2004, the order became final. No appeals were filed. On June 30, 2004, the

de minimis

parties’ settlement in the amount of $3.75 million
(Ball’s $412,169 share was paid on November 6, 2003) was distributed to Gould
Industries who will place the monies into a qualified settlement fund for its use and
performance in performing the site remediation work required by the AOC. The

de minimis

settlement, incorporated into the AOC, has now become final and the
company and subsidiaries will receive contribution protection from the U.S. government
against any future litigation at this site. The company believes that this matter is now
resolved with no material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or
financial condition of the company.

The company previously reported that
in 1998 various consumers filed toxic tort litigation in the Superior Court for Los
Angeles County (Trial Court) against various water companies operating in the
San Gabriel Valley Basin. Plaintiffs also joined other PRPs, including the company, in
the various operable units of the San Gabriel Valley Superfund Site. The Trial Court
consolidated the six separate lawsuits in the Northeast District (Pasadena) and designated
the case of

Adler, et al. v. Southern California Water Company, et al.

, as the lead
case. This case involved allegations that the defendants had violated regulatory drinking
water standards. The parties have now settled this case. The company has agreed to pay
$50,000 toward the settlement. The settlement has been filed with and approved by the
Trial Court. The settlement amount will be tendered to the plaintiffs after the plaintiffs
obtain an order approving the settlement and release of the claims of those plaintiffs who
are minors. The company’s general liability insurance carrier has been defending the
action and is paying the cost of defense, including attorneys’ fees, under a
reservation of rights. The company believes that this matter is now resolved with no
material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition
of the company.

On December 30, 2002, the company
received a 104(e) letter from the USEPA pursuant to CERCLA requesting answers to certain
questions regarding the waste disposal practices of Heekin Can Company and the
relationship between the company and Heekin Can Company. Region 5 of the USEPA is involved
in the cleanup of the Jackson Brothers Paint Company site, which consists of four, and
possibly five, sites in and around Laurel, Indiana. The Jackson Brothers Paint Company
apparently disposed of drums of waste in those sites during the 1960s and 1970s. The USEPA
has alleged that some of the waste that has been uncovered was sent to the sites from the
Cincinnati plant operated by Heekin Can Company. The Indiana Department of Environmental
Management (IDEM) referred this matter to the USEPA for removal of the drums and cleanup.
At the present time there are an undetermined number of drums at one or more of the sites
that have been initially identified by the USEPA as originating from Heekin Can Company.
The USEPA has sent 104(e) letters to seven PRPs including Heekin Can Company. On January
30, 2003, the company responded to the request for information pursuant to Section 104(e)
of CERCLA. The USEPA has initially estimated cleanup costs to be between $4 million and $5
million. Based on the information, or lack thereof, available to the company at the
present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse
effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

Europe

Ball Packaging Europe (BPE), together
with other plaintiffs, is contesting in federal and state administrative courts the
enactment of a mandatory deposit for non-refillable containers based on the German
Packaging Regulation (Verpackungsverordnung). The proceedings in the State Administrative
Court are still active in two States (Bavaria and Hamburg), and the proceedings in the
other states have been declared inactive or have been retracted. The Federal
Constitutional Court in Karsruhe (Bundesverfassungsgericht) has denied the motions of the
plaintiffs for judgment. At the federal level, a proceeding with the Administrative Court
in Berlin (Verwaltungsgericht Berlin) is still pending. BPE filed a motion for an
expedited procedure with the objective of reinstating the suspensive effect of the
procedure. The Administrative Court has denied the motion. BPE has filed an appeal against
this decision with the Higher Administrative Court in Berlin (Oberverwaltungsgericht
Berlin), which also denied the motion. The European Court of Justice has issued a
judgment that confirmed that the German deposit legislation violated, among other EU
regulations, the principle of free trade of goods within the European Union (EU) and
disadvantaged the importers of beverages versus German beverage producers. Following this
judgment, two German law firms have suggested that importers of beverages and possibly
even local beverage producers may be able to market beverages in Germany without mandatory
deposit until a German-wide functioning return system is implemented. The German
government does not share this point of view and has indicated that it will continue to
apply the mandatory deposit regulations. German retailers are hesitant as to which point
of view they share. Based on the information, or lack thereof, available to the company at
the present time, the company is unable to express an opinion as to the actual exposure of
the company.

Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Ball Corporation and subsidiaries
are referred to collectively as “Ball,” “the company,” “we”
and “our” in the following discussion and analysis.

Management’s discussion and
analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Ball Corporation is one of the
world’s leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage and food
industries. Our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are
currently manufactured in 48 plants around the world. We also supply aerospace and
other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers.

We sell our packaging products
primarily to major beverage and food producers with which we have developed long-term
customer relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large
number of long-term supply contracts. While we have diversified our customer base, we do
sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage and food
companies in North America, Europe and the People’s Republic of China (PRC), as does
our equity joint venture in Brazil. We also purchase raw materials from relatively few
suppliers. Because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of a major
customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major supplier or customer,
although our long-term relationships and contracts mitigate these risks.

In the rigid packaging industry in
the U.S. and Canada, sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs, developing new
products, volume expansion and increasing pricing where possible. While the U.S. and
Canadian beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature, the European, PRC
and Brazilian beverage can markets are growing (excluding the effects of the German
mandatory deposit discussed in “International Packaging”) and are expected to
continue to grow. We are capitalizing on this growth by reconfiguring some of our European
can manufacturing lines, building a beverage can manufacturing plant near Belgrade,
Serbia, and expanding our manufacturing capacity in both the PRC and Brazil. The Belgrade
plant is scheduled to be operational by the second quarter of 2005.

With our acquisition of Ball
Packaging Europe in December 2002, Ball’s consolidated earnings are more exposed
to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We attempt to mitigate this exposure through the
use of derivative financial instruments, as discussed in the “Financial Instruments
and Risk Management” section.

As part of our packaging strategy, we
are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the
ever-expanding needs of our beverage and food customers. These innovations include new
shapes, sizes, opening features and other functional benefits of both metal and plastic
packaging. This packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply
positions with major beverage and food customers.

The primary customers for the
products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are U.S.
government agencies or their prime contractors. It is possible that congressional budget
reductions or changes in agency budgets could limit future funding and new contract
awards.

We recognize sales under long-term
contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the cost-to-cost, percentage of
completion method of accounting. Our present contract mix consists of approximately
60 percent cost-plus contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon
profit component, and approximately 40 percent fixed price contracts. We include time
and material contracts in the fixed price category because such contracts typically
provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates. Throughout the period of
contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of
total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress toward completion. Because of
contract payment schedules, limitations on funding and other contract terms, our sales and
accounts receivable for this business include amounts that have been earned but not yet
billed.

Management uses various measures to
evaluate company performance. The primary financial measures we use are earnings before
interest and taxes (EBIT), diluted earnings per share, economic value added, operating
cash flow and free cash flow (generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating
activities less capital expenditures). Nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments
include production spoilage rates, quality control measures and production and shipment
volumes. Additional measures used to evaluate performance in the aerospace and
technologies segment include contract revenue realization, award and incentive fees
realized, proposal win rates and backlog (including awarded, contracted and funded
backlog).

We recognize that attracting and
retaining quality employees is critically important to the success of Ball and, because of
this, we work to pay employees competitively and encourage their prudent ownership of the
company’s common stock. For most management employees, a meaningful portion of
compensation is at risk as an incentive, dependent upon economic value-added operating
performance. For more senior positions, more compensation is at risk. Through our employee
stock purchase plan and 401(k) plan, which matches employee contributions with Ball common
stock, many employees, regardless of organizational level, have opportunities to
participate as Ball shareholders. During 2004 we expanded our employee stock purchase
program to some of our Ball Packaging Europe employees.

In recognition of the company’s
performance, the company’s Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split and
increased the quarterly dividend. The distribution date for the stock split was August 23,
2004, for shareholders of record on August 4, 2004. As a result of the stock split,
all amounts related to earnings per share and share prices have been retroactively
restated as if the split had occurred as of January 1, 2002. Ball’s board also
authorized the repurchase of up to 12 million of the company’s post-split
shares. This authorization replaced all previous authorizations. On January 31, 2005,
the company repurchased 3 million shares, thereby reducing the maximum number of
shares that may yet be repurchased by that amount.

CONSOLIDATED SALES AND
EARNINGS

Ball’s operations are organized
along its product lines and include three segments – North American packaging,
international packaging and aerospace and technologies. We also have investments in
companies in the U.S., the PRC and Brazil, which are accounted for using the equity method
of accounting, and accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or
earnings.

North American Packaging

North American packaging consists of
operations located in the U.S. and Canada, which manufacture metal container products,
used primarily in beverage and food packaging, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
plastic container products, used principally in beverage packaging. This segment accounted
for 65 percent of consolidated net sales in 2004.

Metal Beverage Container
Sales

North American metal beverage
container sales comprised 67 percent of segment sales in 2004 (69 percent in
2003) and were 3 percent higher than in 2003. Contributing to the increase were the
pass through of aluminum price increases and higher volumes in our specialty can products,
partially offset by declines in standard 12-ounce cans. Sales in the first quarter of 2004
were also improved over 2003 due to the acquisition of Metal Packaging International, Inc.
(MPI) in March 2003 (discussed below). North American metal beverage container sales
were slightly higher in 2003 than in 2002 as higher can end volumes resulting from the
acquisition of MPI were partially offset by lower can and end volumes in several regions
of the country due to poor weather conditions. Based on publicly available information, we
estimate that our shipments of metal beverage containers were approximately
31 percent of total U.S. and Canadian shipments in 2004.

In October 2004 we announced
plans to convert a beverage can manufacturing line in our Golden, Colorado, plant from the
production of 12-ounce beverage cans to 24-ounce beverage cans. The Golden line
conversion, which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2005, will
enable Ball to more efficiently match its capacity with the growing demand for custom
cans.

On March 11, 2003, we acquired
MPI, a manufacturer of aluminum beverage can ends, for $28 million. MPI produced just
over 2 billion ends for metal beverage containers per year, primarily for soft drink
companies, and had sales of approximately $42 million in 2002.

Metal Food Container Sales

Metal food container sales in 2004
comprised 22 percent of segment sales (20 percent in 2003) and were
20 percent higher than 2003 sales. Sales were higher due to the acquisition of Ball
Western Can Company, LLC (Ball Western Can) in March 2004 (discussed below), higher
selling prices as a result of the pass through of raw material costs and some pre-buying
by customers in the fourth quarter ahead of expected steel price increases. Negotiations
with respect to 2005 sales contracts are ongoing. We believe these negotiations will result
in the pass through of the majority of the 2005 steel price increases. We estimate our
2004 shipments of approximately 7 billion cans to be approximately 21 percent of
total U.S. and Canadian metal food container shipments, based on publicly available trade
information.

Metal food container sales in 2003
were 3 percent higher than in 2002. Sales were higher in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily
as a result of a multi-year contract with Ross Products, a division of Abbott
Laboratories.

On March 17, 2004, we acquired
ConAgra Grocery Products Company’s (ConAgra) interest in Ball Western Can for
$30 million. Ball Western Can, located in Oakdale, California, was established in
2000 as a 50/50 joint venture between Ball and ConAgra and, prior to the acquisition, was
accounted for by Ball using the equity method of accounting. Ball and ConAgra’s
parent company, ConAgra Foods Inc., signed a long-term agreement under which Ball will
provide metal food containers to ConAgra food packing locations in California. The
acquisition of Ball Western Can added approximately one billion units of annual capacity.

Plastic Container Sales

Plastic container sales in 2004
comprised 11 percent of segment sales (11 percent in 2003) and increased
7 percent compared to 2003. The increase was primarily related to several new preform
sales contracts secured during the year and the price pass through of raw material price
increases. Preform sales, which represent approximately 8 percent of the business,
increased by 56 percent and bottle sales increased by 4 percent over 2003
levels. Carbonated soft drink and water sales volumes were lower than expected primarily
due to reduced demand on the East Coast resulting from competitive pressures and a delay
in the commencement of a new customer supply opportunity on the West Coast. Although only
a small percentage of our total volume, juice and beer container sales increased in 2004
and are expected to grow considerably in the future as more focus is given to these
specialty markets and the development of our Heat-Tek(TM) business. We estimate our 2004
shipments of 5 billion bottles to be approximately 8 percent of total U.S. and
Canadian plastic container shipments.

Plastic container sales in 2003
increased 6 percent compared to 2002. Four plastic bottle blow-molding production
lines were installed during the latter part of 2002 which increased 2003 sales volumes
compared to 2002. Competitive pricing pressure and cold and wet weather conditions on the
East Coast and in the Midwest contributed to lower than expected 2003 sales. In response
to the lower sales, we reduced production at certain plants, and reduced the work force
and idled some of the equipment at our Watertown, Wisconsin, plant.

North American Packaging
Segment Earnings

Segment earnings in 2004 were
18 percent higher than in 2003. The improvement in earnings was the result of higher
sales and production volumes, improved product mix, cost reduction programs and strong
fourth quarter food can sales. In addition, 2003 earnings were negatively impacted by
approximately $11 million of start-up costs associated with a new two-piece food can
manufacturing line in Milwaukee. Partially offsetting these 2004 earnings improvements
were continued pricing pressures on commodity plastic containers for soft drink customers
and an increase in cost of sales due to rising raw material costs under the LIFO
(last-in-first-out) method of accounting.

Segment earnings were slightly lower
in 2003 than in 2002. In addition to the Milwaukee start-up costs, 2003 earnings were
negatively affected by competitive pricing pressures on food cans and plastic containers.
These issues were partially offset by cost improvements achieved through operating
efficiencies, lower spoilage and stringent cost management, particularly in our metal
beverage container plants.

Segment earnings results over the
past three years include various business consolidation activities, which were undertaken
to improve our operations. All of these restructuring activities were completed by the end
of 2004. Segment earnings included business consolidation gains of $1.1 million and $0.2
million for 2004 and 2003, respectively, and a loss of $2.3 million in 2002. In addition
to the business consolidation gains, relocation costs of $2 million and
$2.7 million were incurred in 2004 and 2003, respectively, for the relocation of the
plastics offices and research and development facility from Atlanta, Georgia, to Colorado.
The office relocation was completed during 2003 and the R&D facility relocation was
completed in 2004.

Concerning the business consolidation
activities, earnings of $0.4 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004, as
costs to complete the closure of a metal food container plant were less than expected.
Also in the third quarter, $0.7 million of earnings were recorded to reflect lower than
expected costs incurred on the shut down and relocation of the Atlanta plastics offices
and research and development facility.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, a gain
of $1.6 million was recorded in connection with the sale of a metal beverage container
facility that was shut down in December 2001. In the first quarter of 2003, a net charge
of $1.4 million was booked to record the closure of a metal food container plant and
a gain from a previous plant closure.

In the fourth quarter of 2002, a net
charge of $2.3 million was recorded in connection with the closure of the Atlanta plastics
facilities and the completion of several plant closures commenced prior to 2002.

International Packaging

International packaging includes the
production and sale of metal beverage container products manufactured in Europe and Asia
as well as plastic containers manufactured and sold in Asia. This segment accounted for
23 percent of consolidated net sales in 2004.

Europe

Ball Packaging Europe, which
represents approximately 30 percent of the total European metal beverage container
manufacturing capacity, has manufacturing plants located in Germany, the United Kingdom,
France, the Netherlands and Poland. European sales were 10 percent higher in 2004
than in 2003 as a result of a stronger euro, higher selling prices and successful export
programs from German plants to other European countries. In the first quarter of 2003, one
German can manufacturing line was idled and, in the first quarter of 2004, another German
can manufacturing line was converted from steel to aluminum cans. Another steel can
manufacturing line in the Netherlands is being converted to aluminum partially in response
to increased demand for custom cans in Europe. This conversion is expected to be completed
by the end of the first quarter of 2005.

European sales of $1 billion in
2003 benefited from a strong euro, but were negatively affected by the January 1,
2003, imposition of a mandatory deposit on one-way metal, PET and glass beverage
containers (for beer, carbonated soft drinks and water) in Germany, where four of Ball
Packaging Europe’s plants are located. While sales volumes to German customers from
our European plants were down approximately 2.2 billion cans in 2003 from prior year
levels, warm weather conditions in much of Europe and the continued growth in beverage can
usage in eastern and southern Europe have helped to increase volumes in other countries.
Sales in 2002 were not comparable to 2003 because Ball acquired Ball Packaging Europe on
December 19, 2002.

Construction on a new beverage can
plant near Belgrade, Serbia, commenced during the second quarter of 2004 to serve the
growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern Europe. We currently expect the
new plant to be operational in the second quarter of 2005.

PRC

Sales in the PRC in 2004 increased
18 percent over 2003 levels, which were flat compared to 2002. Earnings before taxes
were significantly improved over the prior year due largely to cost reduction initiatives
resulting from business consolidation actions taken in 2001.

During the fourth quarter of 2004,
Sanshui Jianlibao FTB Packaging Limited (Sanshui JFP), a 35 percent owned PRC joint
venture, experienced a greater than customary seasonal production slowdown caused by cash
flow difficulties. The cash flow difficulties were due to a build up of receivables from
our joint venture partner’s business, which is Sanshui JFP’s major customer.
After discussions with representatives of the local Chinese government, which has taken
control of our joint venture partner’s business, we recorded an allowance for
doubtful accounts in respect of Sanshui JFP’s receivable from the joint venture
partner. Our share of the bad debt provision amounted to $15.2 million and is
included in the consolidated statement of earnings as equity in results of affiliates.

International Packaging
Segment Earnings

International packaging segment
earnings improved in 2004 and 2003 due to a stronger euro and higher profit margins in
both Europe and the PRC due in large part to operational cost reduction programs. The
stronger euro improved our net earnings per diluted share by $0.08 in 2004 compared to
2003. Segment earnings in 2004 were also improved over 2003 by the nonrecurrence of
purchase accounting adjustments which increased Ball Packaging Europe’s cost of sales
in 2003.

In June 2001 we announced a plan
to exit the general line metal can business in the PRC and reduce our PRC beverage can
manufacturing capacity by closing two plants. A $237.7 million pretax charge
($185 million after tax and minority interest impact) was recorded in connection with
this reorganization. We recorded $13.7 million of earnings during 2004,
$3.3 million in 2003 and $5.1 million in 2002 as restructuring activities were
completed, resulting in realization on assets in excess of amounts previously estimated,
as well as costs incurred being less than estimated. Other than tax clearances from the
applicable authorities as the closed facilities are formally liquidated, the costs and
transactions related to the PRC were concluded by the end of 2004.

Aerospace and Technologies

Aerospace and technologies segment
sales represented 12 percent of 2004 consolidated net sales (11 percent in 2003)
and were 22 percent higher than in 2003. Higher sales in 2004 resulted from newly
awarded contracts and additions to previously awarded contracts. The aerospace and
technologies business won a number of large, strategic contracts and delivered a great
deal of sophisticated space and defense instrumentation throughout the period. Net
earnings decreased in 2004 by 2 percent compared to 2003 largely due to increased
pension costs and higher costs incurred on certain cost-plus contracts without
corresponding additional fees as these contracts reach completion. In addition, 2003
margins included approximately $8 million due to successfully achieving milestones in
two key programs. Sales and operating margins in 2003 increased compared to 2002 as a
result of strong operating performance and the program milestones and completions
mentioned above.

Some of the segment’s
high-profile contracts include: the Deep Impact mission, which was launched in
January 2005 to intercept and study a comet; WorldView, an advanced commercial remote
sensing satellite; the James Webb Space Telescope, a successor to the Hubble Space
Telescope; the Space-Based Space Surveillance System, which will detect and track space
objects such as satellites and orbital debris; NPOESS, the next-generation satellite
weather monitoring system; and a number of antennas for the Joint Strike Fighter.

Earnings were recorded of $0.4
million in the fourth quarter of 2004, $0.2 million in the third quarter of 2003 and
$2 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 for exit costs that were no longer required
due to the sale of a product line whose operations ceased in 2001. In the fourth quarter
of 2002, we also recorded a $2.5 million after-tax charge to write off an equity
investment in an aerospace company.

Sales to the U.S. government, either
directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor, represented approximately
82 percent of segment sales in 2004 and 96 percent of segment sales in both 2003
and 2002. The percentage representing U.S. government sales decreased in 2004 due to
growing revenues related to the WorldView contract. Contracted backlog for the aerospace
and technologies segment at December 31, 2004 and 2003, was $694 million and
$644 million, respectively. Year-to-year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily
indicative of the trend of future operations.

For additional information regarding
the company’s segments, see the summary of business segment information in Note 2
accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. The
charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by Ball
management, actuaries and other independent parties and were developed from information
available at the time. If actual outcomes vary from the estimates, the differences will be
reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and
identified as business consolidation gains and losses. Additional details about our
business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in Note 4
accompanying the consolidated financial statements.

Selling and
Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses
were $267.9 million, $234.2 million and $170.6 million for 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to higher costs related
to the company’s deposit share program, higher pension and incentive costs, costs
associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance in 2004, higher research and development costs,
the effects of foreign exchange rates and growth in our aerospace and technologies
segment. In 2004 we reduced our U.S. pension plan discount rate from 6.75 percent to
6.25 percent, resulting in approximately $8.3 million higher U.S. pension
expense for the year compared to 2003, most of which was included in cost of sales.

Approximately $48.1 million of
the increase in 2003 compared to 2002 is related to the acquisition of Ball Packaging
Europe in December 2002. The additional increase in 2003 was primarily the result of
higher employee costs, incentives and higher pension expense, partially offset by lower
expenses in the PRC. In 2003 we reduced our U.S. pension plan long-term asset return
assumption from 9 percent to 8.5 percent and our discount rate from
7.5 percent to 6.75 percent. The changes in the return on pension asset and
discount rate assumptions, as well as actual asset performance, increased North American
pension expense for the year by approximately $14.8 million as compared to 2002. Most
of this increase was included in cost of sales.

For the U.S. pension plans, we intend
to maintain our current return on asset assumption at 8.5 percent for 2005 while
further reducing the discount rate assumption to 6 percent. Based on these
assumptions, U.S. pension expense for 2005 is anticipated to increase approximately
$5.4 million compared to 2004, most of which will be included in cost of sales.
Pension expense in Europe and Canada combined is expected to be comparable to 2004
expense. A further reduction of the plan asset return assumption by one quarter of a
percentage point would result in additional expense of approximately $1.8 million. A
quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate would result in approximately
$3.3 million of additional expense. Additional information regarding the
company’s pension plans is provided in Note 13 accompanying the consolidated
financial statements.

Interest and Taxes

Consolidated interest expense before
debt refinancing costs was $103.7 million in 2004, $125.9 million in 2003 and
$75.6 million in 2002. The lower expense in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to lower
average borrowings and changes in interest rates. The higher expense in 2003 compared to
2002 was associated with the higher level of borrowings subsequent to the acquisition of
Ball Packaging Europe. Debt refinancing costs in 2003 included $15.2 million of costs
associated with the early redemption of the company’s 8.25% senior subordinated notes
in August 2003. Debt refinancing costs in 2002 included $5.2 million related to the
refinancing of the company’s debt in connection with the acquisition of Ball
Packaging Europe.

Ball’s consolidated effective
income tax rate for 2004 was 32 percent compared to 31.3 percent in
2003 and 35.6 percent in 2002. The overall 2004 effective rate was slightly
higher, primarily due to higher North American earnings than in 2003, but continues to
reflect a low consolidated European income tax rate due to lower profits in Germany,
reflecting the impact of the refundable mandatory deposit on non-refillable containers
imposed on January 1, 2003, and a tax holiday in Poland. Germany has the highest tax
rate of the European countries in which Ball has operations.

We are currently reviewing the impact
of making a 2005 foreign earnings distribution to the U.S. via intercompany dividend
distributions in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. If such a
dividend distribution were to occur, we estimate the reasonably possible range of
distributions to be $300 million to $500 million, with the related potential
impact on income tax expense being $7 million to $12 million. See Note 12
in Item 8 for more details on other pending tax matters.

Results of Equity
Affiliates

Equity in the earnings of affiliates
is attributable to our 50 percent ownership in packaging investments in North America
and Brazil, a minority-owned aerospace business and our minority-owned packaging
investments in the PRC and, prior to 2003, in Thailand. Earnings in 2004 included a
$15.2 million loss which represented Ball’s share of a provision for doubtful
accounts related to its 35 percent owned interest in Sanshui JFP (discussed above in
“International Packaging”). Excluding the PRC loss, earnings were
$15.8 million in 2004 compared to $11.3 million in 2003 and $9.3 million in
2002. The higher earnings in 2004 included improved results in our joint ventures in Brazil and
North America.

The higher earnings in 2003 compared to 2002 were the
result of improved earnings in our joint venture in Brazil, offset by lower earnings in
our North American packaging joint ventures and our investment in Thailand no longer being
accounted for under the equity method.

NEW ACCOUNTING
PRONOUNCEMENTS

For information regarding recent
accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements
within Item 8 of this report.

FINANCIAL CONDITION,
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flows and Capital
Expenditures

Cash flows from operating activities
were $535.9 million in 2004 compared to $364 million in 2003 and
$452.3 million in 2002. The lower amount generated in 2003 included
$138.3 million for the payment in January 2003 of an accrued withholding tax
obligation related to the acquisition of Ball Packaging Europe (further discussed below)
which was funded by the seller at the time of closing by the inclusion of
€131 million of additional cash.

Management internally uses a free
cash flow measure: (1) to evaluate the company’s operating results, (2) for
planning purposes, (3) to evaluate strategic investments and (4) to evaluate the
company’s ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term
under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and it should not be inferred that the
entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company
defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property,
plant and equipment (capital spending). Free cash flow is typically derived directly from
the company’s cash flow statements; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect
comparability between periods. An example of such an item excluded in 2003 is the
$138.3 million withholding tax payment liability assumed in the acquisition of Ball
Packaging Europe in December 2002 (discussed above). We believe this is not a
comparable free cash flow outflow of the company as it was funded by the seller.

Based on this, our consolidated free
cash flow is summarized as follows:

($ in millions)

Cash flows from operating activities in
2004 reflected higher earnings and higher accounts payable, offset by higher accounts
receivable and inventories. Inventories and accounts payable were higher due to increased purchases
of raw materials and accounts receivable were higher partially as a result of strong December food can sales.
Cash flow in 2003 included higher earnings, lower accounts receivable and
lower inventories than in 2002 but was offset by lower accounts payable.

Based on information currently
available, we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2005 to be
$500 million or more, capital spending to be approximately $300 million and free cash flow to
exceed $200 million. Capital spending of $196 million in 2004 was below
depreciation and amortization expense of $215.1 million. In 2005 we plan to invest
capital in our highest performing operations, including projects to increase custom can
capabilities, convert lines from steel to aluminum in Europe and the completion of a new
beverage can manufacturing plant in Belgrade, Serbia, as well as expenditures in the
aerospace and technologies segment.

Debt Facilities and Refinancing

Interest-bearing debt at
December 31, 2004, decreased $26.2 million to $1,660.7 million from
$1,686.9 million at year-end 2003. The reduction in interest-bearing debt includes
the net repayment of approximately $78 million of debt, partially offset by the
non-cash translation exchange effect on the balance sheet of having foreign debt
denominated in the stronger euro and British pound. Cash and cash equivalents at
December 31, 2004, were $198.7 million compared to $36.5 million at
December 31, 2003. We intend to use much of the 2004 ending cash balance to
repurchase shares of our stock.

At December 31, 2004,
approximately $407 million was available under the revolving credit facility portions
of the multi-currency senior credit facilities. The company also had $234 million of
short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of the year, of which
$43.7 million was outstanding.

During the first quarter of 2004,
Ball repaid €31 million ($38 million) of the euro denominated Term
Loan B and reduced the interest rate by 50 basis points. During the fourth
quarter of 2003, Ball repaid $160 million of the U.S. dollar denominated Term
Loan B and €25 million of the euro denominated Term Loan B. At the
time of the early repayment, the interest rate on the U.S. portion of the Term Loan B
was reduced by 50 basis points. Interest expense during the first quarter of 2004 and
the fourth quarter of 2003 included $0.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively,
for the write off of the unamortized financing costs associated with the repaid loans.

On August 8, 2003, Ball
refinanced 8.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due in 2008 through the private placement
of $250 million of 6.875% Senior Notes due in 2012 issued at a price of 102%
(effective yield to maturity of 6.58 percent). In connection with the refinancing of the higher
interest debt, in the third quarter of 2003 a pretax charge of $15.2 million was
recorded as interest expense, which consisted of the payment of a $10.3 million call
premium and the write off of $4.9 million of unamortized financing costs.

In connection with the acquisition of
Ball Packaging Europe, we refinanced $389 million of our existing debt and, as a
result, recorded in 2002 a pretax charge of $5.2 million for the write off of
unamortized financing costs.

The company has a receivables sales
agreement which provides for the ongoing, revolving sale of a designated pool of trade
accounts receivable of Ball’s North American packaging operations, up to
$200 million as of December 31, 2004 ($175 million as of December 31,
2003). The agreement qualifies as off-balance sheet financing under the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140. Net funds received
from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled $174.7 million and $175 million
at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are reflected as a reduction of
accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets.

The company was not in default of any
loan agreement at December 31, 2004, and has met all payment obligations. The U.S.
note agreements, bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements
contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios,
guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness.

Additional details about the
company’s receivables sales agreement and debt are available in Notes 5 and 11,
respectively, accompanying the consolidated financial statements.

The company’s purchase obligations include contracted amounts for
                    aluminum, steel, plastic resin and other

direct materials. Also included
                    are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity, aerospace and

technologies contracts and other less significant items. In cases where
                    variable prices and/or usage are

involved, management’s best
                    estimates have been used. Depending on the circumstances, early termination of

the contracts may not result in penalties and, therefore, actual
                    payments could vary significantly.

Contributions to the company’s
defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded German plans, are expected to be
approximately $17 million in 2005. This estimate may change based on plan asset
performance. Benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be $43 million,
$44 million, $47 million, $49 million and $51 million for the years
ending December 31, 2005 through 2009, respectively, and $301 million thereafter.
Payments to participants in the unfunded German plans are expected to be approximately
$24 million in 2005, $25 million in each of the years 2006 through 2009 and a
total of $123 million thereafter.

We have increased our share
repurchase program in 2005 to between $150 million and $175 million, net of issuances, compared to
$50 million net in 2004. On January 31, 2005, Ball repurchased 3 million of its
common shares at an initial price of $42.72 per share using cash on hand and available borrowings.
The price per share is subject to a price adjustment based on a weighted average price calculation for the period between
the initial purchase date and the settlement date of July 6, 2005.

Annual cash dividends paid on common
stock were 35 cents per share in 2004, 24 cents per share in 2003 and
18 cents per share in 2002. Ball increased its dividends for the third and fourth
quarter of 2004 from seven and a half to 10 cents per share, resulting in dividend
payments which were $12.1 million higher in 2004 than in 2003. The company also
increased its dividends for the third and fourth quarters of 2003 from four and a half to
seven and a half cents per share. This change resulted in dividend payments which were
$6.4 million higher in 2003 than in 2002.

Contingencies

The company is subject to various
risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business due, in part, to the
competitive nature of the industries in which we participate, our operations in developing
markets outside the U.S., changing commodity prices for the materials used in the
manufacture of our products and changing capital markets. Where practicable, we attempt to
reduce these risks and uncertainties through the establishment of risk management policies
and procedures, including, at times, the use of derivative financial instruments as
explained in Item 7A of this report.

From time to time, the company is
subject to routine litigation incident to its business. Additionally, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency has designated Ball as a potentially responsible party,
along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Our
information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a material adverse
effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

Due to political and legal
uncertainties in Germany, no nationwide system for returning containers was in place at
the time a mandatory deposit was imposed in January 2003 and most retailers stopped
carrying beverages in non-refillable containers. On October 15, 2004, the German
parliament adopted a proposal leaving the existing deposit of 25 eurocents per container
in effect. This decision, however, was ruled not in compliance with the European Union
(EU) law, and therefore does not provide a stable legal situation to which the industry
can adapt. The outcome of the legal proceedings of the EU Commission is unclear and the
political discussions about the deposit continue. We have responded by reducing beverage
can production at our German plants, implementing aggressive cost reduction measures and
increasing exports from Germany to other European countries. We also closed a plant in the
United Kingdom, shut down one production line in Germany, delayed capital investment
projects in France and Poland and have converted one of our steel can production lines in
Germany to aluminum in order to facilitate additional can exports from Germany.

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future
events could affect these estimates. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements for a summary of the company’s critical and significant accounting
policies.

The U.S. economy and the company have
experienced minor general inflation during the past several years. Management believes
that evaluation of Ball’s performance during the periods covered by these
consolidated financial statements should be based upon historical financial statements.

Forward-Looking
Statements

The company has made or implied
certain forward-looking statements in this annual report which are made as of the end of
the time frame covered by this report. These forward-looking statements represent the
company’s goals, and results could vary materially from those expressed or implied.
From time to time we also provide oral or written forward-looking statements in other
materials we release to the public. As time passes, the relevance and accuracy of
forward-looking statements may change. Some factors that could cause the company’s
actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: fluctuation in customer and
consumer growth and demand, particularly during the months when the demand for metal
beverage cans is heaviest; loss of one or more major customers; product introductions;
insufficient production capacity; overcapacity in foreign and domestic metal and plastic
container industry production facilities and its impact on pricing and financial results;
lack of productivity improvement or production cost reductions; changes in climate and
weather; fruit, vegetable and fishing yields; power and natural resource costs; difficulty
in obtaining supplies and energy, such as gas and electric power; shortages in and pricing
of raw materials, particularly resin, steel, aluminum and energy, and the ability or
inability to include or pass on to customers changes in raw material costs; changes in the
pricing of the company’s products and services; competition in pricing and the
possible decrease in, or loss of, sales resulting therefrom; loss of profitability and
plant closures; insufficient or reduced cash flow; transportation costs; the number and
timing of the purchases of the company’s common shares; the ability to obtain
adequate credit resources for foreseeable financing requirements of the company’s
businesses and to satisfy the resulting credit obligations; fiscal and monetary policies
established by the United States or foreign governments; regulatory action or federal and
state legislation including mandated corporate governance and financial reporting laws;
the German mandatory deposit or other restrictive packaging legislation such as recycling
laws; increases in interest rates, particularly on floating rate debt of the company;
labor strikes; increases and trends in various employee benefits and labor costs,
including pension, medical and health care costs incurred in the countries in which Ball
has operations; rates of return projected and earned on assets and discount rates used to
measure future obligations and expenses of the company’s defined benefit retirement
plans; boycotts; litigation; antitrust, intellectual property, consumer and other issues;
maintenance and capital expenditures; goodwill impairment; the effect of LIFO accounting
on earnings; changes in generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation;
local economic conditions; the authorization, funding and availability of contracts for
the aerospace and technologies segment and the nature and continuation of those contracts
and related services provided thereunder; technical uncertainty and schedule of
performance associated with such segment contracts; international business and market
risks such as the devaluation of certain currencies; pricing and ability or inability to
sell scrap associated with the production of metal and plastic containers; the ability to
invoice and collect accounts receivable related to such segment contracts in the ordinary
course of business; international business risks (including foreign exchange rates and
activities of foreign subsidiaries) in Europe and particularly in developing countries
such as the PRC and Brazil; changes in the foreign exchange rates of the U.S. dollar
against the European euro, British pound, Polish zloty, Serbian dinar, Hong Kong dollar,
Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi and Brazilian real, and in the foreign exchange rate of
the European euro against the British pound, Polish zloty and Serbian dinar; terrorist
activity or war that disrupts the company’s production, supply or pricing of raw
materials used in the production of the company’s goods and services, including
increased energy costs, and/or disruptions in the ability of the company to obtain
adequate credit resources for the foreseeable financing requirements of the company’s
businesses; successful or unsuccessful acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures and
the integration activities associated therewith; changes to unaudited results due to
statutory audits of our financial statements or internal controls over financial
reporting; and loss contingencies related to income and other tax matters, including those
arising from audits performed by U.S. and foreign tax authorities. If the company is
unable to achieve its goals, then the company’s actual performance could vary
materially from those goals expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. The
company currently does not intend to publicly update forward-looking statements except as
it deems necessary in quarterly or annual earnings reports. You are advised, however, to
consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K
reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 7A.  Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Financial Instruments and
Risk Management

In the ordinary course of business,
we employ risk management policies and procedures to reduce our exposure to commodity
price changes, changes in interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currencies and
fluctuations in prices of the company’s common stock in regard to common share
repurchases. Although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit and
interest risk, the counter parties to the agreements are financial institutions, which are
expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements.

To test the sensitivity of our market
risk exposure, we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive
instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or
rates. The results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below. Actual changes in
market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes.

Commodity Price Risk

We manage our commodity price risk in
connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum primarily by entering into container
sales contracts, which generally include aluminum-based pricing terms that consider price
fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases. Such terms
generally include a fixed price or an upper limit to the aluminum component pricing. This
matched pricing affects most of our North American metal beverage container net sales. We
also, at times, use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as
cash flow hedges of commodity price risk.

North American plastic container
sales contracts include provisions to pass through resin cost changes. As a result, we
believe we have minimal, if any, exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin.
Most North American food container sales contracts either include provisions permitting us
to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur or incorporate annually negotiated
steel costs. In 2004 we were able to pass through steel surcharges to our customers and we
are currently in negotiations with respect to 2005 steel price increases. We believe these
negotiations will result in the pass through of the majority of this year’s steel
price increases.

In Europe and Asia the company
manages aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and long-term
contracts for the purchase of the materials, as well as certain sales of containers, that
reduce the company’s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current
year. These purchase and sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass-through
pricing arrangements. The company also uses forward and option contracts as cash flow
hedges to minimize the company’s exposure to significant price changes for those
sales contracts where there is not a pass-through arrangement.

Considering the effects of derivative instruments, the market’s
ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse
change in the company’s metal prices could result in an estimated $3.8 million after-tax reduction of net earnings
over a one-year period. Additionally, if foreign currency exchange rates were to change adversely by 10 percent, we estimate
there could be a $5.2 million after-tax reduction of net earnings over a one-year period for foreign currency exposures
on the metal. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates.

The company is also exposed to
fluctuations in prices for utilities such as natural gas and electricity. A hypothetical
10 percent increase in our utility prices could result in an estimated $5.3 million
after-tax reduction of net earnings over a one-year period. Actual results may vary based
on actual changes in market prices and rates.

Interest Rate Risk

Our objective in managing exposure to
interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash
flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we use a
variety of interest rate swaps and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed-rate
debt. Interest rate instruments held by the company at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
included pay-fixed and pay-floating interest rate swaps. Pay-fixed swaps effectively
convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments. Pay-floating swaps
effectively convert fixed-rate obligations to variable rate instruments.

Based on our interest rate exposure
at December 31, 2004, assumed floating rate debt levels throughout 2005 and the effects of
derivative instruments, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates could result in an
estimated $4.3 million after-tax reduction of net earnings over a one-year period.
Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing
of these changes.

Foreign Currency
Exchange Rate Risk

Our objective in managing exposure to
foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings associated
with foreign exchange rate changes through the use of cash flow hedges. In addition, we
manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of foreign currency
options. Our foreign currency translation risk results from the European euro, British
pound, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real and Serbian dinar. We face currency
exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars
and, to a lesser extent, in other currencies. Sales contracts are negotiated with
customers to reflect cost changes and, where there is not a foreign exchange pass-through
arrangement, the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency
exposures.

Considering the company’s
derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2004, and the currency
exposures, a hypothetical 10 percent reduction in foreign currency exchange rates
compared to the U.S. dollar could result in an estimated $12.8 million after-tax
reduction of net earnings over a one-year period. This amount includes the $5.2 million currency
exposure discussed above in the “Commodity Price Risk” section. Actual changes in market prices or rates
may differ from hypothetical changes.

Common Share Repurchases

In connection with the company’s
ongoing share repurchases, on January 31, 2005, Ball repurchased 3 million of its
common shares at an initial price of $42.72 per share. The price per share is subject
to a price adjustment based on a weighted average price calculation for the period between
the initial purchase date and the settlement date of July 6, 2005.

The company also sells put options
from time to time, which give the purchasers of those options the right to sell shares of
the company’s common stock to the company on specified dates at specified prices upon
the exercise of those options. The put option contracts allow us to determine the method
of settlement, either in cash or shares. At December 31, 2004, there were put option
contracts outstanding for 200,000 shares at $31.75 per share, which expired without value
in February 2005. There were no put option contracts outstanding at December 31, 2003.

Item 8.  Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm

To

the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Ball Corporation:

We have completed an integrated audit
of Ball Corporation’s 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and

consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial
statements

In our opinion, the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of cash
flows and of shareholders’ equity and comprehensive earnings present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries

at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004,

in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over
financial reporting

Also, in our opinion,
management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing in Item 9A, that the company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control –
Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The company’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted
our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries

1.  Critical and
Significant Accounting Policies

In the application of accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingencies and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. These estimates
are based on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.

Critical Accounting
Policies

The company considers certain
accounting policies to be critical, as their application requires management’s best
judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Following is a discussion of the accounting policies we consider critical to our
consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition in
the Aerospace and Technologies Segment

Sales under long-term contracts in
the aerospace and technologies segment are recognized under the cost-to-cost,
percentage-of-completion method. This business segment sells using two types of long-term
sales contracts – cost-plus sales contracts, which represent approximately
60 percent of sales, and fixed price sales contracts that account for the
remainder. A cost-plus sales contract is an agreement to perform the contract for cost
plus an agreed upon profit component, whereas fixed price sales contracts are completed
for a fixed price or involve the sale of engineering labor at fixed rates per hour.
Cost-plus sales contracts can have different types of fee arrangements, including fixed
fee, cost, schedule and performance incentive fees, award fees or a combination thereof.

During initial periods of sales
contract performance, our estimates of base, incentive and other fees are established at a
conservative estimate of profit over the period of contract performance. Throughout the
period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our
estimates of total contract revenue, total contract cost and extent of progress toward
completion. Provision for estimated contract losses, if any, is made in the period that
such losses are determined to be probable. Because of sales contract payment schedules,
limitations on funding and contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable generally
include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed. As a prime U.S. government
contractor or subcontractor, the aerospace and technologies segment is subject to a high
degree of regulation, financial review and oversight by the U.S. government.

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

We evaluate the carrying value of
goodwill annually, and we evaluate our other intangible assets whenever there is evidence
that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these
assets may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a fair value
approach, using discounted cash flows to establish fair values. We recognize an impairment
charge for any amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value.
When available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate
discounted cash flow results. When a business within a reporting unit is disposed of,
goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition using the relative fair value
methodology.

We amortize the cost of other
intangibles over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite.
Amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows
and, if impaired, written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or
appraised values. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for
impairment and written down to fair value as required.

Defined Benefit Pension
Plans and Other Employee Benefits

The company has defined benefit plans
that cover the majority of its employees, including those at Ball Packaging Europe, for
which we assumed a portion of the assets and liabilities of the former Schmalbach-Lubeca
GmbH Pension Plan when we acquired Ball Packaging Europe in December 2002. We also
have postretirement plans that provide medical benefits and life insurance for retirees
and eligible dependents. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance
provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87,
“Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,” and SFAS No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.”
Both of these statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the
long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to measure future obligations
and expenses, salary scale inflation rates, health care cost trend rates and other
assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension and
postretirement plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible
to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial
valuations, market conditions and contracted benefit changes. The selection of assumptions
is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of
valuation. However, actual results may differ substantially from these assumptions.

Pension plan liabilities are revalued
annually based on updated assumptions and information about the individuals covered by the
plan. For pension plans, accumulated gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent
corridor, the prior service cost and the transition asset are amortized on a straight-line
basis from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active
participants. For other postemployment benefits, the 10 percent corridor is not
used.

In addition to defined benefit and
postretirement plans, the company maintains reserves for employee medical claims, up to
our insurance stop-loss limit, and workers’ compensation claims. These are regularly
evaluated and revised, as needed, based on a variety of information including historical
experience, third party actuarial estimates and current employee statistics.

Taxes on Income

Deferred tax assets, including
operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carry forwards, are reduced by a valuation
allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that any portion
of these tax attributes will not be realized. In addition, from time to time, management
must assess the need to accrue or disclose a possible loss contingency for proposed
adjustments from various federal, state and foreign tax authorities that regularly audit
the company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments, management must
often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions, including many foreign
jurisdictions.

Deferred income taxes reflect the
future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based upon enacted income
tax laws and tax rates. Income tax expense or benefit is provided based on earnings
reported in the financial statements. The provision for income tax expense or benefit
differs from the amounts of income taxes currently payable because certain items of income
and expense included in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in different
time periods by taxing authorities.

Business Consolidation
Costs

The company estimates its liabilities
for business consolidation activities by accumulating detailed estimates of costs and
asset sales proceeds, if any, for each business consolidation initiative. This includes
the estimated costs of employee severance and related benefits, impairment of property and
equipment and other assets, including estimates of realizable value, contract termination
payments for leases, contractual obligations and any other qualifying costs related to
the exit plan. These estimated costs are grouped by specific projects within the overall
exit plan and are then monitored on a monthly basis. Such disclosures represent
management’s best estimates, but require assumptions about the plans that may change
over time. Changes in estimates for individual locations are evaluated periodically to
determine if a change in estimate is required for the overall restructuring plan.
Subsequent changes to the original estimates are included in current period earnings and
identified as business consolidation gains or losses.

Significant Accounting
Policies

Principles of
Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Ball Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries (collectively,
Ball, the company, we or our). Equity investments in which we exercise significant
influence, but do not control and are not the primary beneficiary, are accounted for using
the equity method. Investments in which we do not exercise significant influence
over the investee are accounted for using the cost method. Significant intercompany
transactions are eliminated. As of January 1, 2004, the results of subsidiaries and
certain equity affiliates in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) are no longer
reflected in the consolidated financial statements on a one-month lag. The change did not
have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements in 2004.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents have original
maturities of three months or less.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower
of cost or market. The cost of the aluminum component of U.S. metal beverage container
inventories and substantially all inventories within the U.S. metal food container
business is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting. The cost
of remaining inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or
average cost.

Depreciation and
Amortization

Depreciation and amortization are
provided using the straight-line method in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the
assets over their estimated useful lives (buildings and improvements – 15 to
40 years; machinery and equipment – 5 to 15 years; other intangible assets
– approximately 7 years, weighted average).

Deferred financing costs are
amortized over the life of the related loan facility and are reported as part of interest
expense. When debt is repaid prior to its maturity date, the write-off of the remaining
unamortized deferred financing costs is also reported as interest expense.

Environmental Reserves

We estimate the liability related to
environmental matters based on, among other factors, the degree of probability of an
unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss.
We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. As additional
information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending
matters and revise our estimates.

Revenue Recognition in
the Packaging Segments

Sales of products in the packaging
segments are recognized when delivery has occurred and title has transferred, there is
persuasive evidence of an agreement or arrangement, the price is fixed and determinable,
and collection is reasonably assured.

Stock-Based Compensation

Ball has a variety of restricted
stock and stock option plans. With the exception of the company’s deposit share
program, which is accounted for as a variable plan and is discussed in Note 14, the
compensation cost associated with restricted stock grants is calculated using the fair
value at the date of grant and amortized over the restriction period. Expense related to
stock options is calculated using the intrinsic value method under the guidelines of
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, and is therefore not included in
the consolidated statements of earnings. Ball’s earnings as reported include
after-tax stock-based compensation of $12.5 million, $7.6 million and
$4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
If the fair value based method had been used, after-tax stock-based compensation would
have been $9.3 million in 2004, $8.8 million in 2003 and $8 million in
2002, and diluted earnings per share would have been higher by $0.03 in 2004 and lower by
$0.01 and $0.04 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Further details regarding the expense
calculated under the fair value based method are provided in Note 14.

Foreign Currency
Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign
operations, where the local currency is the functional currency, are translated using
period-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange
rates during each period. Translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated other
comprehensive earnings as a component of shareholders’ equity.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

The company uses derivative financial
instruments for the purpose of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates,
foreign currency exchange rates, raw materials purchasing and common share repurchases.
The company’s derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets
at fair value. For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge of a recognized asset or
liability, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together
with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged.
For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the
derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted
transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss associated with
a cash flow hedge is reported in earnings immediately.

Realized gains and losses from hedges
are classified in the income statement consistent with the accounting treatment of the
item being hedged. Gains and losses upon the early termination of effective derivative
contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive earnings and amortized to
earnings in the same period as the originally hedged items affect earnings.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified in order to conform to the current year presentation.

New Accounting
Pronouncements

In December 2004 the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),
“Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) is a revision
of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and
supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”
The new standard, which will be effective for Ball beginning in the third quarter of 2005,
establishes accounting standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity
instruments for goods or services, including stock option and restricted stock grants.
Ball is evaluating the impact on the company’s results from adopting
SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), but expects it to be comparable to the pro forma
effects of applying the original SFAS No. 123 (see Note 14 for further details).

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act)
was signed into law. The Jobs Act provides
certain domestic companies a temporary opportunity to repatriate previously undistributed earnings of controlled
foreign subsidiaries at a reduced federal tax rate, approximating 5.25%. The reduced rate is achieved via an 85%
dividends received deduction on earnings repatriated during a one-year period. Accounting and disclosure guidance
was provided in December 2004 in FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the
Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.” Ball is in the process of
evaluating whether it will repatriate foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act, and if
so, the amount that will be repatriated. Further details are available in Note 12.

In December 2004 the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 109-1,
“Application of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004.” The Jobs Act introduces a special 9 percent tax deduction (3 percent per year
beginning January 1, 2005) on qualified production activities. FAS 109-1 clarifies that this tax deduction should
be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with SFAS No. 109. Until U.S. Treasury regulations and
other guidance is provided, we cannot estimate the impact FAS 109-1 will have on our consolidated financial
statements.

In November 2004 the FASB issued
SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs – an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter
4.” SFAS No. 151 requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) to be recognized as current-period charges.
It also requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of
conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151
will be effective for inventory costs incurred by Ball beginning on January 1, 2006;
early adoption is not anticipated. Ball has not yet determined the potential future
impact, if any, of SFAS No. 151 on its consolidated financial statements.

On December 8, 2003, the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the MPDIM Act) was
signed into law. The MPDIM Act expanded Medicare to include, for the first time, coverage
for prescription drugs. Ball expects that this legislation may eventually reduce the
company’s costs for its retiree medical programs. In May 2004 the FASB issued
Staff Position No. FAS 106-2, which provides accounting guidance and disclosure for the subsidy. FAS 106-2
did not have a significant effect on Ball’s consolidated financial statements in 2004
and is not expected to have a significant effect in 2005.

2.  Business Segment
Information

Ball’s operations are organized
and reviewed by management along its product lines in three reportable segments –
North American packaging, international packaging and aerospace and technologies. We have
investments in all three segments that are accounted for under the equity method of
accounting, and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or earnings.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
critical and significant accounting policies. See also Notes 3 and 4 for information
regarding transactions affecting segment results.

North American Packaging

North American packaging consists of
operations in the U.S. and Canada, which manufacture metal and polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) plastic containers, primarily for use in beverage and food packaging.

International Packaging

International packaging, with
operations in several countries in Europe and the PRC, includes the manufacture and sale
of metal beverage container products in Europe and Asia, as well as plastic containers in
Asia.

Aerospace and
Technologies

Aerospace and technologies includes
the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and services used
primarily in the defense, civil space and commercial space industries.

3.  Acquisitions

Ball Western Can Company
(Ball Western Can)

On March 17, 2004, Ball acquired
ConAgra Grocery Products Company’s (ConAgra) interest in Ball Western Can for $30
million. Ball Western Can, located in Oakdale, California, was established in 2000 as a
50/50 joint venture between Ball and ConAgra and, prior to the acquisition, was accounted
for by Ball using the equity method of accounting. The acquisition has been accounted for
as a purchase, and accordingly, its results have been consolidated in our financial
statements from the acquisition date. Contemporaneous with the acquisition, Ball and
ConAgra’s parent company, ConAgra Foods Inc., entered into a long-term agreement
under which Ball provides metal food containers to ConAgra manufacturing locations in
California. The acquisition of Ball Western Can is not significant to the North American
packaging segment.

Metal Packaging
International (MPI)

On March 11, 2003, Ball acquired
MPI, a manufacturer of ends for aluminum beverage cans, for $28 million. MPI produced
just over 2 billion ends per year, primarily for soft drink companies, and had sales
of approximately $42 million in 2002. The MPI plant, which had approximately
100 employees and was located in Northglenn, Colorado, was closed during the second
quarter of 2003 and sold in October 2004. The manufacturing volumes were consolidated
into other Ball facilities. The acquisition of MPI was not significant to the North
American packaging segment.

Ball Packaging Europe

On December 19, 2002, Ball
acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Schmalbach-Lubeca GmbH (a European
beverage can manufacturer) for an initial purchase price of €922.3 million at
closing (approximately $948 million), plus acquisition costs of $11.6 million, refinancing
costs of $28.1 million and the assumption of approximately $20 million of debt
and $145 million of cash. Ball also assumed approximately $300 million of
ongoing pension liabilities. In addition, at closing Ball assumed a €131 million
withholding tax liability ($138.3 million at the time of payment), which was paid in
January 2003 with cash provided by the seller at the time of the acquisition. The
final purchase price was reduced in 2003 by $39.8 million for working capital and
other purchase price adjustments, including the final valuation of pension liabilities.

4.  Business
Consolidation Activities

North American Packaging


During 2004 Ball concluded all
business consolidation activities for North American Packaging. The remaining carrying
value of assets held for disposal was not significant. In the fourth quarter a gain of
$0.4 million was recorded, as costs were less than estimated for the 2003 closure of
a metal food container plant. In the third quarter, earnings of $0.7 million were recorded
as costs related to the shut down and relocation of the Atlanta plastics offices and
research and development (R&D) facility were less than expected. The office relocation
was completed during 2003 and the R&D facility relocation was completed in 2004.


A gain of $1.6 million was recorded
in the fourth quarter in connection with the sale, and the completion of the consolidation
activities, related to a metal beverage container plant closed in December 2001. In the
first quarter Ball announced plans to close a metal food container plant to address
decreased demand for three-piece welded cans. In connection with the closure, a charge of
$1.9 million was recorded, partially offset by a $0.5 million gain on the sale
of a Canadian plant that was included in a business consolidation charge taken in 2000.
The $1.9 million charge included $0.8 million for employee severance and benefit
costs and $1.1 million for decommissioning costs and an impairment charge on fixed
assets.


In the fourth quarter Ball announced
it would relocate its plastics office and R&D facility from Atlanta, Georgia, to
Colorado. In connection with the relocation, a pretax charge of $1.6 million was
recorded, including $0.8 million for employee severance and benefit costs and
$0.8 million for decommissioning costs and the impairment of leasehold improvements.
Also in the fourth quarter, $0.7 million of net charges were recorded related to the
completion of several plant closures commenced prior to 2002.

International Packaging

At December 31, 2004, accruals of
$9.1 million remain, primarily for tax matters and costs of liquidation of the companies
related to PRC business consolidation activities commenced prior to 2002. Tax clearances
from the applicable authorities are required during the formal liquidation process. The
company recorded $13.7 million of earnings in 2004, $3.3 million in 2003 and
$5.1 million in 2002, primarily related to the realization of assets in the PRC in excess
of amounts previously estimated, and costs of consolidation and liquidation less than
anticipated, related to a $237.7 million business consolidation charge taken in the second
quarter of 2001.

Ball Packaging Europe closed its
plant in Runcorn, England, at the end of December 2003. The cost of the plant closure,
along with costs associated with a line conversion and a line shut down at other plants,
estimated to be €11.9 million in total, was accounted for in the opening
acquisition balance sheet. These costs include €8.7 million for employee
termination costs and €3.2 million for decommissioning costs, of which €7.4
million has been paid and €0.7 million was reversed to goodwill as costs were
less than initially estimated. The remaining balance of €3.8 million includes
€1.4 million of pension benefits to be paid in future periods, €0.6 million
of decommissioning costs and €1.8 million of early retirement benefits to be
paid under local law in 2005. There are no remaining assets held for sale at
December 31, 2004.

Aerospace and
Technologies

Earnings of $0.4 million were
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004, $0.2 million in the third quarter of 2003 and
$2 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 for exit costs that were no longer required
due to the sale of a product line whose operations ceased in 2001. Also in the fourth
quarter of 2002, a $2.5 million after-tax charge to write off an equity investment in
an aerospace company was recorded.

5.  Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are net of an
allowance for doubtful accounts of $17.1 million at December 31, 2004, and
$15.4 million at December 31, 2003.

A receivables sales agreement
provides for the ongoing, revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable
of Ball’s North American packaging operations of up to $200 million (increased
during the second quarter of 2004 from the previous limit of $175 million). The agreement
qualifies as off-balance sheet financing under the provisions of SFAS No. 140.
Net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled $174.7 million
and $175 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are reflected
as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. Fees incurred in
connection with the sale of accounts receivable, which are reported as part of selling and
administrative expenses, totaled $3.2 million in 2004, $2.5 million in 2003 and
$3 million in 2002.

Net accounts receivable under
long-term contracts, due primarily from agencies of the U.S. government and their prime
contractors, were $85.8 million and $102.7 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and included unbilled amounts
representing revenue earned but contractually not yet billable of $15.7 million and
$13 million, respectively. The average length of the long-term contracts is
approximately 3.3 years and the average length remaining on those contracts at
December 31, 2004, was approximately 15 months. Approximately $2.4 million
of unbilled receivables at December 31, 2004, is expected to be collected after
one year and is related to customary fees and cost withholdings that will be paid upon
milestone or contract completions, as well as final overhead rate settlements.

December 31, 2004 and 2003 would have been $12.1 million and
$1.4 million higher, respectively, than the reported amounts if the FIFO method of
accounting, which approximates replacement cost, had been used for those inventories.

result of planned capital spending projects as well as the effects of foreign exchange
rates.

During 2003 the company entered into
capital leases totaling $6.7 million. The acquisitions of equipment under these
capital leases were noncash transactions
and, accordingly, have been excluded from the consolidated statement of cash flows.

intangible assets and foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2004, total annual
intangible asset amortization expense is expected to be between approximately
$10 million and $11 million in each of the next five years.

During the fourth quarter of 2004,
Sanshui Jianlibao FTB Packaging Limited (Sanshui JFP), a 35 percent owned PRC joint
venture, experienced a greater than customary seasonal production slowdown caused by cash
flow difficulties. The cash flow difficulties were due to a build up of receivables from
our joint venture partner’s business, which is Sanshui JFP’s major customer.
After discussions with representatives of the local Chinese government, which has taken
control of our joint venture partner’s business, we recorded an allowance for
doubtful accounts in respect of Sanshui JFP’s receivable from the joint venture
partner. Our share of the bad debt provision amounted to $15.2 million and is
included in the consolidated statement of earnings as equity in results of affiliates. Our
investment was reduced in connection with the charge and the company believes it will be able to
recover its remaining investment in the joint venture.

10.  Leases

The company leases warehousing and
manufacturing space and certain equipment, primarily within the packaging segments, and
office and technical space, primarily within the aerospace and technologies segment.
During 2003 we entered into a lease which qualifies as an operating lease for book
purposes and a capital lease for tax purposes. Under this lease arrangement, Ball has the
option to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease term, or if we elect not
to do so, to compensate the lessor for the difference between a guaranteed minimum
residual value of $12.2 million and the fair market value of the asset, if less.
Certain of the company’s leases in effect at December 31, 2004, include renewal
options and/or escalation clauses for adjusting lease expense based on various factors.

Total noncancellable operating leases
in effect at December 31, 2004, require rental payments of $43.4 million,
$33.3 million, $23.8 million, $15.8 million and $11.7 million for the
years 2005 through 2009, respectively, and $39 million combined for all years
thereafter. Lease expense for all operating leases was $71.3 million,
$64.8 million and $50.7 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

11.  Debt and Interest
Costs

Short-term debt at December 31,
2004, includes $43.7 million outstanding under uncommitted bank facilities totaling
$234 million. At December 31, 2003, $39.3 million was outstanding under
uncommitted bank facilities totaling $179.6 million. The weighted average interest
rate of the outstanding short-term facilities was 3.26 percent at December 31,
2004, and 3.24 percent at December 31, 2003.

Long-term debt at December 31

The senior credit facilities bear
interest at variable rates and also include (1) a multi-currency long-term revolving
credit facility which provides the company with up to the equivalent of $415 million
and (2) a Canadian long-term revolving credit facility which provides the company
with up to the equivalent of $35 million. Both revolving credit facilities expire in
2007. At December 31, 2004, approximately $407 million was available under the
revolving credit facilities. The notes payable and senior credit facilities contain
certain covenants and restrictions including, among other things, limits on the incurrence
of additional indebtedness and limits on the amount of restricted payments, such as
dividends and share repurchases.

During the first quarter of 2004,
Ball repaid €31 million ($38 million) of the euro denominated Term
Loan B and reduced the interest rate by 50 basis points. During the fourth
quarter of 2003, Ball repaid $160 million of the U.S. dollar denominated Term
Loan B and €25 million of the euro denominated Term Loan B. At the
time of the early repayment, the interest rate on the U.S. portion of the Term Loan B
was reduced by 50 basis points. Interest expense during the first quarter of 2004 and
the fourth quarter of 2003 included $0.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively,
for the write off of the unamortized financing costs associated with the repaid loans.

On August 8, 2003, Ball
refinanced 8.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due in 2008 through the placement of
$250 million of 6.875% Senior Notes due in 2012 issued at a price of 102% (effective
yield to maturity of 6.58 percent). In connection with the refinancing of the higher interest
debt, in the third quarter of 2003 a pretax charge of $15.2 million was recorded as
interest expense, which consisted of the payment of a $10.3 million call premium and
the write off of $4.9 million of unamortized financing costs.

In connection with the acquisition of
Ball Packaging Europe, Ball refinanced approximately $389 million of its existing
debt and, as a result, recorded in 2002 a pretax charge of $5.2 million for the write
off of unamortized financing costs.

The remaining deferred financing
costs are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 9)
and are being amortized to earnings on a straight-line basis over the remaining lives of
the related facilities.

Maturities of all fixed long-term
debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2004, are $79.3 million,
$378.1 million, $85.2 million, $18 million and $489.2 million for the
years ending December 31, 2005 through 2009, respectively, and $562.9 million
thereafter.

Ball issues letters of credit in the
ordinary course of business to secure liabilities recorded in connection with industrial
development revenue bonds and certain self-insurance arrangements. Letters of credit
outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003, were $43 million and $45.6 million,
respectively.

The notes payable and senior credit
facilities are guaranteed on a full, unconditional and joint and several basis by certain
of the company’s domestic wholly owned subsidiaries. Certain tranches of the senior
credit facilities are similarly guaranteed by certain of the company’s wholly owned
foreign subsidiaries. Note 19 contains further details as well as condensed,
consolidating financial information for the company, segregating the guarantor
subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries.

The company was not in default of any
loan agreement at December 31, 2004, and has met all debt payment obligations. The U.S.
note agreements, bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements
contain certain restrictions relating to dividend payments, share repurchases,
investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness.

In 1995 Ball Packaging Europe’s
Polish subsidiary was granted a tax holiday. Under the terms of the holiday, an exemption
was granted on manufacturing earnings for up to €39.5 million of income tax. At
December 31, 2004, the remaining tax holiday available to reduce future Polish tax
liability was €9.9 million.

Net income tax payments were
$72.6 million, $28.4 million and $16.2 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

The significant components of
deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31 were:

The change in deferred taxes during
2004 is primarily attributable to accelerated (including bonus) depreciation, the effects
of foreign exchange rates and an increase in accrued pension liabilities.

At December 31, 2004, Ball
Packaging Europe and subsidiaries had net operating loss carry forwards, with no
expiration date, of $45.9 million with a related tax benefit of $13.1 million.
Due to the uncertainty of ultimate realization, that benefit has been offset by a
valuation allowance of $5.4 million. Any realization of the valuation allowance will
be recognized as a reduction in goodwill.

At December 31, 2004,
$20.5 million of capital loss carry forwards expired unused. As a valuation allowance
had been provided on the entire tax benefit, the expiration of the capital loss carry
forward had no impact on the 2004 income tax provision.

On October 22, 2004, the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act) was signed into law and, in December 2004, accounting
guidance was provided in FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-2. The Jobs Act provides
certain domestic companies a temporary opportunity to repatriate previously undistributed
earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries at a reduced federal tax rate, approximating
5.25%. The reduced rate is achieved via an 85% dividends received deduction on earnings
repatriated during a one-year period. To qualify for the deduction, the repatriated
earnings must be reinvested in the U.S. pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan
established by the company’s chief executive officer and subsequently approved by the
company’s board of directors. Certain other criteria in the Jobs Act must be
satisfied as well. The maximum amount of Ball’s foreign earnings that could qualify
for the temporary deduction is $500 million. For Ball, the one-year period during
which the qualifying distributions can be made is 2005. Ball is in the process of
evaluating whether it will repatriate foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions
of the Jobs Act and has not made a decision on whether it will make any distributions.
Ball is assessing the impact of proposed statutory technical corrections with respect to
certain provisions in the Jobs Act and anticipates that no distributions will occur if
certain technical correction provisions are not legislated into law. If the company
determines that a distribution will be made, the range of reasonably possible amounts eligible for the
temporary deduction is $300 million to $500 million. Ball expects to determine the
amounts and sources of foreign earnings to be repatriated, if any, no later than the
fourth quarter of 2005. While the company is not yet in a position to determine the impact
of a qualifying repatriation on its income tax expense for 2005, the related potential
range of income tax effects on the reasonably possible repatriation amounts is estimated
at $7 million to $12 million.

As noted above for the Jobs Act,
provision has not been made currently, or historically, for additional U.S. or foreign
withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of controlled foreign corporations where such
earnings will continue to be reinvested. It is not practical to estimate the additional
taxes, including applicable foreign withholding taxes, that might become payable upon the
eventual remittance of the foreign earnings for which no provision has been made. Until a
decision is made with regard to a potential distribution pursuant to the Jobs Act,
management’s intention is to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is
currently examining Ball’s consolidated income tax returns for the tax years 2000 and
2001 and has proposed several adjustments to taxable income. The only significant
adjustment proposes to disallow Ball’s deductions of interest expense incurred on
loans under a company-owned life insurance plan that has been in place for 18 years.
Ball believes that its interest deductions will be sustained as filed so no provision for
loss has been accrued. The IRS’s proposed adjustments would result in an increase in
taxable income for 2000 and 2001 of $18.6 million and a corresponding increase in tax
expense of $7.3 million plus related interest expense. In addition, Ball would incur
an increase in taxable income for subsequent tax years 2002 to 2004 in the amount of
$30.6 million with an increase in tax expense of $12.1 million plus any related
interest expense. Although it is very early in the process, Ball intends to vigorously
defend the interest expense deduction.

Defined Benefit Pension
Plans

The company’s pension plans
cover substantially all U.S., Canadian and European employees meeting certain eligibility
requirements. The defined benefit plans for salaried employees, as well as those for
hourly employees in Germany and the United Kingdom, provide pension benefits based on
employee compensation and years of service. Plans for North American hourly employees
provide benefits based on fixed rates for each year of service. The German plans are not
funded but the company maintains book reserves and annual additions to the reserves are
generally tax deductible. With the exception of the German plans, our policy is to fund
the plans on a current basis to the extent deductible under existing tax laws and
regulations and in amounts at least sufficient to satisfy statutory funding requirements.
We also have defined benefit pension obligations in France and Austria, the assets and
liabilities of which are insignificant.

An analysis of the change in benefit
accruals for 2004 and 2003 follows:

(a)

The German plans are unfunded and the liability is included in the
                    company’s balance sheet. Benefits are

paid directly by the company
                    to the participants. The German plans represented $353.6 million and

$323.3 million of the total unfunded status at December 31, 2004
                    and 2003, respectively. The increase from

2003 to 2004 is primarily the
                    result of changes in foreign exchange rates.

The assumption related to the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings
expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits over the life of the plans. The
assumption is based upon Ball’s pension plan asset allocations, investment strategies
and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Some reliance
was placed on historical asset returns of our plans. An asset-return generation model was
used to project future asset returns using simulation and asset class correlation. The
analysis includes expected future risk premiums, forward-looking return expectations
derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the price earnings ratios of major stock
market indexes, expected inflation and real risk-free interest rate assumptions, and the
fund’s expected asset allocation.

The expected long-term rates of
return on assets are calculated by applying the expected rate of return to a market
related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, adjusted for the weighted
average expected contributions and benefit payments. For the North American plans, the
market related value of plan assets used to calculate expected return was
$604.4 million for 2004, $570.4 million for 2003 and $501.6 million for
2002.

Included in other comprehensive
earnings, net of related tax effect, were increases in the minimum liability of
$33.2 million and $99.2 million in 2004 and 2002, respectively, and a decrease
of $11.8 million in 2003.

For pension plans, accumulated gains
and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor, the prior service cost and the
transition asset are being amortized over the average remaining service period of active
participants.

Defined Benefit Pension
Plan Assets

Investment policies and strategies
for the plan assets in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom are established by pension
investment committees and include the following common themes: (1) to provide for
long-term growth of principal income without undue exposure to risk; (2) to minimize
contributions to the plans; (3) to minimize and stabilize pension expense; and (4) to
achieve a rate of return which is above the market average for each asset class over the
long term. The pension investment committees are required to regularly, but no less
frequently than once annually, review asset mix and asset performance, as well as the
performance of the investment managers. Based on their reviews, which are generally
conducted quarterly, investment policies and strategies are revised as appropriate.

Target asset allocations in the U.S.
and Canada are set using a minimum and maximum range for each asset category as a percent
of the total funds market value. Assets contributed to the United Kingdom plans are
invested using established percentages. Following are the target asset allocations
established as of December 31, 2004:

Contributions to the company’s
defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded German plans, are expected to be
approximately $17 million in 2005. This estimate may change based on plan asset
performance. Benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be $43 million,
$44 million, $47 million, $49 million and $51 million for the years
ending December 31, 2005 through 2009, respectively, and $301 million thereafter.
Payments to participants in the unfunded German plans are expected to be approximately
$24 million in 2005, $25 million in each of the years 2006 through 2009 and a
total of $123 million thereafter.

Other Postemployment
Benefits

The company sponsors defined benefit
and defined contribution postretirement health care and life insurance plans for
substantially all U.S. and Canadian employees. Employees may also qualify for long-term
disability, medical and life insurance continuation and other postemployment benefits upon
termination of active employment prior to retirement. All of the Ball-sponsored
postretirement health care and life insurance plans are unfunded and, with the exception
of life insurance benefits, are self-insured.

In Canada, the company provides
supplemental medical and other benefits in conjunction with Canadian provincial health
care plans. Most U.S. salaried employees who retired prior to 1993 are covered by
noncontributory defined benefit medical plans with capped lifetime benefits. Ball provides
a fixed subsidy toward each retiree’s future purchase of medical insurance for U.S.
salaried and substantially all nonunion hourly employees retiring after January 1, 1993.
Life insurance benefits are noncontributory. Ball has no commitments to increase benefits
provided by any of the postemployment benefit plans.

An analysis of the change in other
postemployment benefit accruals for 2004 and 2003 follows:

The assumptions used for the
determination of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost were the same as used
for the U.S. and Canadian defined benefit pension plans. For other postemployment
benefits, accumulated gains and losses, the prior service cost and the transition asset
are being amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants.

For the U.S. health care plans at
December 31, 2004, a 10 percent health care cost trend rate was used for pre-65
and post-65 benefits, and trend rates were assumed to decrease by 1 percent per year
until 2010 when they reach 5 percent and remain level thereafter. For the Canadian
plans, an 8.5 percent health care cost trend rate was used, which was assumed to
decrease in one-percent increments to 4.5 percent by 2008 and remain at that level in
subsequent years.

Health care cost trend rates can have
an effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one-percentage point change
in assumed health care cost trend rates would increase or decrease the total of service
and interest cost by approximately $0.4 million and the postemployment benefit
obligation by approximately $8 to $9 million.

Other Benefit Plans

The company matches employee
contributions to the 401(k) plan with shares of Ball common stock, up to 50 percent
of up to 6 percent of a participant’s annual salary. The expense associated with
the company match amounted to $13 million, $11.7 million and $10.9 million
for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

In addition, substantially all
employees within the company’s aerospace and technologies segment who participate in
Ball’s 401(k) plan receive a performance-based matching cash contribution of up to
4 percent of base salary. The company recognized $4.8 million, $6 million
and $4.8 million of additional compensation expense related to this program for the
years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

In 2004 the company’s 401(k)
plan matching contributions could not exceed $6,500 per employee due to the 401(k)
aggregate limit on employee contributions of $13,000.

14.  Shareholders’
Equity

At December 31, 2004, the company had
240 million shares of common stock and 15 million shares of preferred stock
authorized, both without par value. Preferred stock includes 120,000 authorized but
unissued shares designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

On July 28, 2004, the company’s
board of directors declared a two-for-one split of Ball’s common stock and authorized
the repurchase of up to 12 million common shares. The stock split was effective
August 23, 2004, for all shareholders of record on August 4, 2004. As a result of the
stock split, all amounts prior to the split related to earnings, options and outstanding
shares have been retroactively restated as if the split had occurred as of January 1,
2002.

Under the company’s successor
Shareholder Rights Plan, one Preferred Stock Purchase Right (Right) is attached to each
outstanding share of Ball Corporation common stock. Subject to adjustment, each Right
entitles the registered holder to purchase from the company one one-thousandth of a share
of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $130 per Right.
If a person or group acquires 15 percent or more of the company’s outstanding
common stock (or upon occurrence of certain other events), the Rights (other than those
held by the acquiring person) become exercisable and generally entitle the holder to
purchase shares of Ball Corporation common stock at a 50 percent discount. The Rights,
which expire in 2006, are redeemable by the company at a redemption price of one cent per
Right and trade with the common stock. Exercise of such Rights would cause substantial
dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire control of the company without the
approval of Ball’s board of directors. The Rights would not interfere with any merger
or other business combinations approved by the board of directors.

As a result of the company’s
stock split, which was distributed on August 23, 2004, the rights attaching to the
shares (pursuant to the Rights agreement dated January 24, 1996) automatically split
so that one-quarter of a right attached to each share of Ball Corporation common stock
outstanding upon the effective date of the stock split. Ball previously split the
company’s common stock on February 22, 2002.

In connection with the employee stock
purchase plan, the company contributes 20 percent of up to $500 of each participating
employee’s monthly payroll deduction toward the purchase of Ball Corporation common
stock. Company contributions for this plan were approximately $2.7 million in 2004,
$2.5 million in 2003 and $1.9 million in 2002.

Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Earnings (Loss)

The activity related to accumulated
other comprehensive earnings (loss) was as follows:

No taxes have been provided on the foreign currency
translation component for any period, as the undistributed earnings of the company’s foreign investments will continue
to be reinvested. The change in the minimum pension liability is presented net of related tax benefit of $20.8 million
for 2004, related tax expense of $7.7 million for 2003 and related tax benefit of $63.3 million for 2002.

Stock Options and
Restricted Shares

The company has several stock option
plans under which options to purchase shares of common stock have been granted to officers
and key employees at the market value of the stock at the date of grant. Payment must be
made at the time of exercise in cash or with shares of stock owned by the option holder,
which are valued at fair market value on the date exercised. Options issued through
December 31, 2004, terminate 10 years from date of grant. Commencing one year from
date of grant, options vest in four equal annual amounts.

Ball adopted a deposit share program
in March 2001 that, by matching purchased shares with restricted shares, encourages
certain senior management employees and outside directors to invest in Ball stock. In
general, restrictions on the matching shares lapse at the end of four years from date of
grant, or earlier if established share ownership guidelines are met, assuming the
qualifying purchased shares are not sold or transferred prior to that time. This plan is
accounted for as a variable plan where compensation expense is recorded based upon the
current market price of the company’s common stock until restrictions lapse. The
company recorded $17.5 million, $10.5 million and $6 million of expense in
connection with this program in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The variances in
expense recorded are the result of the timing and vesting of the share grants, as well as
the higher price of Ball stock. The deposit share program was amended and restated in
April 2004 and further awards of up to 357,000 shares have been made, of which
277,100 grants have occurred as of December 31, 2004. Participants in this award
generally have until April 2005 to acquire shares in order to receive the matching
restricted share grants.

Prior to passage of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act), Ball guaranteed loans made by a third party bank to
certain participants in the deposit share program, of which $3 million of
grandfathered loans were outstanding at December 31, 2004. In the event of a
participant default, Ball would pursue payment from the participant. The Act provides that
companies may no longer guarantee such loans for its executive officers. In accordance
with the provisions of the Act, the company has not and will not guarantee any additional
loans to its executive officers.

Additional information regarding
options outstanding at December 31, 2004, follows:

These options cannot be traded in any
equity market. However, based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, adapted for use
in valuing compensatory stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123, options granted in
2004, 2003 and 2002 have estimated weighted average fair values at the date of grant of
$10.24 per share, $8.63 per share and $8.29 per share, respectively. The actual value
an employee may realize will depend on the excess of the stock price over the exercise
price on the date the option is exercised. Consequently, there is no assurance that the
value realized by an employee will be at or near the value estimated. The fair values were
estimated using the following weighted average assumptions:

Ball accounts for its stock-based

No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” If we had elected to
recognize compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123,
pro forma net earnings and earnings per share would have been:

          Per share amounts have been retroactively restated for the two-for-one stock
          split effective August 23, 2004.

Subsequent Event

On January 31, 2005, Ball repurchased 3 million of
its outstanding common shares in a privately negotiated accelerated stock repurchase transaction at an initial
price of $42.72 per share. The transaction immediately reduced Ball’s outstanding common shares by 3 million
shares. The shares are subject to a market price adjustment provision which may require a payment to be made by
Ball or to Ball based on the volume weighted average trading price of the company’s shares between January 31, 2005, and
July 6, 2005.

15.  Earnings Per Share

The following table provides
additional information on the computation of earnings per share amounts. Share and per
share information have been retroactively restated for the two-for-one stock splits
discussed in Note 14.

Certain options have been excluded
from the computation of the diluted earnings per share calculation since they were
anti-dilutive (i.e., the exercise price exceeded the average closing market price of
common stock for the year). A total of 639,400 options at an exercise price of $28.155 and
1,095,000 options at an exercise price of $23.745 were excluded for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. There were no anti-dilutive options for the
year ended December 31, 2004.

16.  Financial
Instruments and Risk Management

Policies and Procedures

In the ordinary course of business,
we employ established risk management policies and procedures to reduce our exposure to
commodity price changes, changes in interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currencies and
fluctuations in prices of the company’s common stock in regard to common share
repurchases. Although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit and
interest risk, the counterparties to the agreements are financial institutions, which are
expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements.

Commodity Price Risk

We manage our North American
commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum primarily by
entering into container sales contracts, which include aluminum-based pricing terms that
consider price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases.
The terms include a fixed price or an upper limit to the aluminum component pricing. This
matched pricing affects substantially all of our North American metal beverage container
net sales. We also, at times, use certain derivative instruments such as option and
forward contracts as cash flow hedges of commodity price risk.

North American plastic container
sales contracts include provisions to pass through resin cost changes. As a result, we
believe we have minimal, if any, exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin.
Most North American food container sales contracts either include provisions permitting us
to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur or incorporate annually negotiated
steel costs. In 2004 we were able to pass through steel surcharges to our customers and we
are currently in negotiations with respect to 2005 steel price increases. We believe these
negotiations will result in the pass through of the majority of this year’s steel
price increases.

In Europe and Asia, the company
manages the aluminum and steel raw commodity price risks through annual contracts for the
purchase of the materials, as well as certain sales of containers, that reduce the
company’s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year. These
purchase and sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass through pricing
arrangements. The company additionally uses forward and option contracts as cash flow
hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures for those sales
contracts where there is not a pass through arrangement to minimize the company’s
exposure to significant price changes.

At December 31, 2004, the
company had aluminum forward contracts with notional amounts of $303.4 million
hedging its aluminum purchase contracts. These forward contract agreements expire within
the next four years.

Included in shareholders’ equity at December 31,
2004, within accumulated other comprehensive earnings, is a net gain of $8.4 million
associated with these contracts, of which a net gain of $8.2 million is expected to
be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during 2005. The
majority of the gains on these derivative contracts will be offset by lower revenue from
fixed price sales contracts. At December 31, 2003, the company had aluminum forward
contracts with notional amounts of $115.6 million hedging the aluminum in the
aluminum purchase contracts.

Interest Rate Risk

Our objective in managing our
exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on
earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these
objectives, we use a variety of interest rate swaps, collars and options to manage our mix
of floating and fixed-rate debt. Interest rate instruments held by the company at
December 31, 2004, included pay-floating and pay-fixed interest rate swaps. Pay-fixed
swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments.
Pay-floating swaps effectively convert fixed-rate obligations to variable rate
instruments. Swap agreements expire at various times up to two years.

Interest rate swap agreements
outstanding at December 31, 2004, had notional amounts of $220 million paying floating
rates and $120 million paying fixed rates, or a net floating position
of $100 million. Approximately $2.7 million of net gain related to the
termination or deselection of hedges is included in accumulated other comprehensive
earnings at December 31, 2004, of which approximately $1.7 million is expected
to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during 2005. The fair market
value of agreements designated as fair value and cash flow hedges in accordance with
SFAS No. 133 was insignificant at December 31, 2004 and 2003. The company also has
an interest rate cap on Eurolibor interest rates with a notional amount of
€50 million. The fair value was not material at December 31, 2004 or 2003.
At December 31, 2003, the agreements had notional amounts of $50 million paying
floating rates and $139.6 million paying fixed rates, or a net fixed position of
$89.6 million.

The fair value of all non-derivative
financial instruments approximates their carrying amounts with the exception of long-term
debt. Rates currently available to the company for loans with similar terms and maturities
are used to estimate the fair value of long-term debt based on discounted cash flows. The
fair value of derivatives generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay or
receive upon termination of the contracts at December 31, 2004, taking into account
any unrealized gains and losses on open contracts.

Foreign Currency
Exchange Rate Risk

Our objective in managing exposure to
foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings associated
with foreign exchange rate changes through the use of cash flow hedges. In addition, we
manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of foreign currency
options. Our foreign currency translation risk results from the European euro, British
pound, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Serbian dinar, Brazilian real and Chinese renminbi. We face currency
exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in U.S.
dollars. Sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and, where
there is not a foreign exchange pass-through arrangement, the company uses forward and
option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures. Contracts outstanding at December
31, 2004, expire within the next four years and approximately $0.5 million of net
loss is included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings, all of which is expected to
be recognized in earnings over the next year.

Common Share Repurchases

In connection with the company’s
ongoing share repurchases, on January 31, 2005, Ball repurchased 3 million of its
common shares at an initial price of $42.72 per share. The price per share is subject
to a price adjustment based on a weighted average price calculation for the period between
the initial purchase date and the settlement date of July 6, 2005.

The company also sells put options
which give the purchasers of those options the right to sell shares of the company’s
common stock to the company on specified dates at specified prices upon the exercise of
those options. The put option contracts allow us to determine the method of settlement,
either in cash or shares. At December 31, 2004, there were put option contracts
outstanding for 200,000 shares at $31.75 per share, which expired without value
in February 2005. There were no put option contracts outstanding at December 31, 2003.

17.  Quarterly Results of
Operations (Unaudited)

The company’s fiscal years end
on December 31 and the fiscal quarters generally end on the Sunday nearest the
calendar quarter end. In 2004 the first quarter included six more shipping days than in
2003 and the fourth quarter had five fewer shipping days than in 2003.

2004 Quarterly
Information

The third and fourth quarters of 2004
included earnings of $6.7 million and $8.5 million, respectively, related to
business consolidation activities for which proceeds on assets were higher than originally
estimated and costs of completion were less than anticipated. The fourth quarter also
included a $15.2 million loss pertaining to an allowance for doubtful accounts
related to a minority-owned PRC joint venture. Other than these items, fluctuations in
sales and earnings for the quarters in 2004 reflected the number of days in each fiscal
quarter, as well as the normal seasonality of the business.

2003 Quarterly
Information

A gain of $1.6 million was recorded
in the fourth quarter in connection with the sale, and the completion of the consolidation
activities, related to a metal beverage container plant closed in December 2001. In the
first quarter Ball announced plans to close a metal food container plant to address
decreased demand for three-piece welded cans. In connection with the closure, a charge of
$1.9 million was recorded, partially offset by a $0.5 million gain on the sale
of a Canadian plant that was included in a business consolidation charge taken in 2000.
The $1.9 million charge included $0.8 million for employee severance and benefit
costs and $1.1 million for decommissioning costs and an impairment charge on fixed
assets.

(a)

Gross profit is shown after depreciation and amortization related to cost of
                    sales of $191 million and

$179.6 million for the years ended
                    December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

(b)

Per share amounts have been retroactively restated for the two-for-one stock
                    split discussed in Note 14.

Earnings per share calculations for
each quarter are based on the weighted average shares outstanding for that period. As a
result, the sum of the quarterly amounts may not equal the annual earnings per share
amount.

18.  Research and
Development

Research and development costs are
expensed as incurred in connection with the company’s internal programs for the
development of products and processes. Costs incurred in connection with these programs,
the majority of which are included in cost of sales, amounted to $25.5 million,
$20.5 million and $18.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

19.  Subsidiary
Guarantees of Debt

As discussed in Note 11, the
company’s notes payable and senior credit facilities are guaranteed on a full,
unconditional and joint and several basis by certain of the company’s domestic
wholly owned subsidiaries. Certain tranches of the senior credit facilities are similarly
guaranteed by certain of the company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. The senior
credit facilities are secured by: (1) a pledge of 100 percent of the stock owned by
the company in its material direct and indirect majority-owned domestic subsidiaries and
(2) a pledge of the company’s stock, owned directly or indirectly, of certain foreign
subsidiaries, which equals 65 percent of the stock of each such foreign subsidiary.
The following is condensed, consolidating financial information for the company,
segregating the guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries, as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, and for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (in millions
of dollars). Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to the
current year presentation. Separate financial statements for the guarantor subsidiaries
and the non-guarantor subsidiaries are not presented because management has determined
that such financial statements would not be material to investors.

20.  Contingencies

The company is subject to various
risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business due, in part, to the
competitive nature of the industries in which we participate, our operations in developing
markets, changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our
products and changing capital markets. Where practicable, we attempt to reduce these risks
and uncertainties through the establishment of risk management policies and procedures,
including, at times, the use of certain derivative financial instruments.

From time to time, the company is
subject to routine litigation incident to its business. Additionally, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency has designated Ball as a potentially responsible party,
along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Our
information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a material adverse
effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

Due to political and legal
uncertainties in Germany, no nationwide system for returning beverage containers was in
place at the time a mandatory deposit was imposed in January 2003 and nearly all
retailers stopped carrying beverages in non-refillable containers. On October 15, 2004,
the German parliament adopted a proposal leaving the existing deposit of 25 eurocents
per container in effect. This decision, however, is still not in compliance with the EU
law, and therefore does not provide a stable legal situation to which the industry can
adapt. The outcome of the legal proceedings of the EU Commission is unclear and the
political discussions about the deposit continue. We have responded by reducing beverage
can production at our German plants, implementing aggressive cost reduction measures and
increasing exports from Germany to other European countries. We also closed a plant in the
United Kingdom, shut down a production line in Germany, delayed capital investment
projects in France and Poland and have converted one of our steel can production lines in
Germany to aluminum in order to facilitate additional can exports from Germany.

21.  Indemnifications and
Guarantees

During the normal course of business,
the company or the appropriate consolidated direct or indirect subsidiaries have made
certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which the specified entity may be
required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These indemnities,
commitments and guarantees include indemnities to the customers of the subsidiaries in
connection with the sales of their packaging and aerospace products and services,
guarantees to suppliers of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the company guaranteeing the
performance of the respective entity under a purchase agreement, indemnities for
liabilities associated with the infringement of third party patents, trademarks or
copyrights under various types of agreements, indemnities to various lessors in connection
with facility, equipment, furniture, and other personal property leases for certain claims
arising from such leases, indemnities pursuant to agreements relating to certain joint
ventures, indemnities in connection with the sale of businesses or substantially all of
the assets and specified liabilities of businesses, and indemnities to directors, officers
and employees of the company to the extent permitted under the laws of the State of
Indiana and the United States of America. The duration of these indemnities, commitments
and guarantees varies, and in certain cases, is indefinite. In addition, the majority of
these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the
maximum potential future payments the company could be obligated to make. As such, the
company is unable to reasonably estimate its potential exposure under these items. The
company has not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The company does, however, accrue for
payments under promissory notes and other evidences of incurred indebtedness and for
losses for any known contingent liability, including those that may arise from
indemnifications, commitments and guarantees, when future payment is both reasonably
determinable and probable. Finally, the company carries specific and general liability
insurance policies and has obtained indemnities, commitments and guarantees from third
party purchasers, sellers and other contracting parties, which the company believes would,
in many circumstances, provide recourse to any claims arising from these indemnifications,
commitments and guarantees.

The company’s senior notes and
senior credit facilities are guaranteed on a full, unconditional and joint and several
basis by certain of the company’s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. Certain
tranches of the senior credit facilities are similarly guaranteed by certain of the
company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. These guarantees are required in support
of the notes and credit facilities referred to above, are co-terminous with the terms of
the respective note indentures and credit agreement and would require performance upon
certain events of default referred to in the respective guarantees. The maximum potential
amounts which could be required to be paid under the guarantees are essentially equal to
the then outstanding principal and interest under the respective notes and credit
agreement, or under the applicable tranche. The company is not in default under the above
notes or credit facilities.

Ball Capital Corp. II is a separate,
wholly owned corporate entity created for the purchase of receivables from certain of the
company’s wholly owned subsidiaries. Ball Capital Corp. II’s assets will be
available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of its creditors. The company has
provided an undertaking to Ball Capital Corp. II in support of the sale of receivables to
a commercial lender or lenders which would require performance upon certain events of
default referred to in the undertaking. The maximum potential amount which could be paid
is equal to the outstanding amounts due under the accounts receivable financing (see
Note 5). The company, the appropriate subsidiaries and Ball Capital Corp. II are not
in default under the above credit arrangement.

From time to time, the company is
subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of
management, no such matter, individually or in the aggregate, exists which is expected to
have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.

Item 9.  
Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

There were no matters required to be
reported under this item.

Item 9A.  Controls and
Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure
controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the company,
including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify the
company’s financial reports and to other members of senior management and the board
of directors.

Based on their evaluation as of
December 31, 2004, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the
company have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are
effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and
forms.

Management’s Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such
term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in “Internal Control – Integrated
Framework”

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in “Internal Control –
Integrated Framework,” our management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004. Our management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8,
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Changes in Internal
Control

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the company migrated the North American metal beverage customer pricing and
invoicing system from a legacy system to an integrated corporate business system (the new system). The migration
involved changes in systems that included internal controls. We have reviewed the new system and the controls affected by the
implementation of the new system and made appropriate changes to affected internal controls. The controls as
modified are appropriate and operating effectively. There were no other changes in our internal control over
financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2004, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
