Item
      1.

Business

Ball
      Corporation was organized in 1880 and incorporated in Indiana in 1922. Its
      principal executive offices are located at 10 Longs Peak Drive, Broomfield,
      Colorado 80021-2510. The terms "Ball," "the company," "we" and "our" as
      used herein refer to Ball Corporation and its consolidated
      subsidiaries.

Ball
      is a
      manufacturer of metal and plastic packaging, primarily for beverages and foods,
      and a supplier of aerospace and other technologies and services to government
      and commercial customers.

Information
      Pertaining to the Business of the Company

The
      company has determined that it has five reportable segments organized along
      a
      combination of product lines and geographic areas:  (1) North American
      metal beverage packaging, (2) North American metal food packaging,
      (3) North American plastic packaging, (4) international packaging and
      (5) aerospace and technologies. Prior periods required to be shown in this
      Annual Report on Form 10-K (Annual Report) have been conformed to the
      current presentation.

A
      substantial part of our North American and international packaging sales are
      made directly to companies in packaged beverage and food businesses, including
      SABMiller and bottlers of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola branded beverages and their
      affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups. Sales to SABMiller
      plc
      and PepsiCo, Inc., represented 11 percent and 10 percent of Ball’s
      consolidated net sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005.
      Additional details about sales to major customers are included in Note 2 to
      the consolidated financial statements, which can be found in Item 8 of this
      Annual Report (“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”).

North
      American Packaging Segments

Our
      principal business in North America is the manufacture and sale of aluminum,
      steel and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) containers, primarily for beverages
      and foods. Packaging products are sold in highly competitive markets, primarily
      based on quality, service and price. The North American packaging business
      is
      capital intensive, requiring significant investment in machinery and equipment.
      Profitability is sensitive to selling prices, production volumes, labor,
      transportation, utility and warehousing costs, as well as the availability
      and
      price of raw materials, such as aluminum, steel, plastic resin and other direct
      materials. These raw materials are generally available from several sources
      and
      we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies and are not
      experiencing any shortages. We believe we have limited our exposure related
      to
      changes in the costs of aluminum, steel and plastic resin as a result of
      (1) the inclusion of provisions in most aluminum container sales contracts
      to pass through aluminum cost changes, as well as the use of derivative
      instruments, (2) the inclusion of provisions in certain steel container
      sales contracts to pass through steel cost changes and the existence of certain
      other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated
      metal
      costs and (3) the inclusion of provisions in substantially all plastic container
      sales contracts to pass through resin cost changes. In 2004 and 2005 we were
      able to pass through the majority of steel surcharges levied by producers and
      continually attempt to reduce manufacturing and other material costs as much
      as
      possible. While raw materials and energy sources, such as natural gas and
      electricity, may from time to time be in short supply or unavailable due to
      external factors, and the pass through of steel costs to our customers may
      be
      limited in some instances, we cannot predict the timing or effects, if any,
      of
      such occurrences on future operations.

Research
      and development (R&D) efforts in the North American packaging segments are
      directed toward the development of new sizes and types of metal and plastic
      beverage and food containers, as well as new uses for the current containers.
      Other research and development efforts in these segments seek to improve
      manufacturing efficiencies. During 2004 we completed our expansion of the Ball
      Technology and Innovation Center located near Denver, Colorado. All of our
      North
      American R&D activities are now conducted in that facility.

North
      American Metal Beverage Packaging

North
      American metal beverage packaging represents Ball’s largest segment, accounting
      for 42 percent of consolidated net sales in 2005. Decorated two-piece
      aluminum beverage cans are produced at 16 manufacturing facilities in the
      U.S. and one each in Canada and Puerto Rico. Can ends are produced within four
      of the U.S. facilities, as well as in a fifth facility that manufactures only
      ends. Metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multi-year supply
      contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks, beer, energy drinks and other
      beverages. Sales volumes of metal beverage containers in North America tend
      to
      be highest during the period from April through September.

Through
      Rocky Mountain Metal Container, LLC, a 50/50 joint venture, which is accounted
      for as an equity investment, Ball and Coors Brewing Company (Coors), a wholly
      owned subsidiary of Molson Coors Brewing Company, operate beverage can and
      end manufacturing facilities in Golden, Colorado. The joint venture supplies
      Coors with beverage cans and ends for its Golden, Colorado, and Memphis,
      Tennessee, breweries and supplies ends to its Shenandoah, Virginia, filling
      location. Ball receives management fees and technology licensing fees under
      agreements with the joint venture. In addition to beverage containers supplied
      to Coors from the joint venture, Ball supplies, from its own facilities,
      substantially all of Coors’ metal container requirements for its Shenandoah,
      Virginia, filling location, as well as other containers not manufactured by
      the
      joint venture.

Based
      on
      publicly available industry information, we estimate that our North American
      metal beverage container shipments in 2005 of approximately 32 billion cans
      were approximately 31 percent of total U.S. and Canadian shipments of metal
      beverage containers. Three producers manufacture substantially all of the
      remaining metal beverage containers. Two of these producers and three other
      independent producers also manufacture metal beverage containers in Mexico.
      Available information indicates that North American metal beverage container
      shipments have been relatively flat during the past several years.

Beverage
      container production capacity in the U.S., Canada and Mexico exceeds demand.
      In
      order to more closely balance capacity and demand within our business, from
      time
      to time we consolidate our can and end manufacturing capacity into fewer, more
      efficient facilities. We also attempt to efficiently match capacity with the
      changes in customer demand for our packaging products. To that end, during
      the
      second quarter of 2005 we completed the conversion of a beverage can
      manufacturing line in our Golden, Colorado, plant from the production of
      12-ounce beverage cans to 24-ounce beverage cans. In the fourth quarter of
      2005 we began the conversion of a line in our Monticello, Indiana, plant from
      12-ounce can manufacturing to a line capable of producing beverage cans in
      sizes
      up to 16 ounces. The Monticello conversion was substantially completed
      during January 2006. During 2005 Ball commenced a project to upgrade and
      streamline its North American beverage can end manufacturing capabilities,
      a
      project expected to result in productivity improvements and reduced
      manufacturing costs. In connection with these activities, the company recorded
      a
      pretax charge of $19.3 million ($11.7 million after tax) in the third
      quarter of 2005. We have installed the first production module in this
      multi-year project and the second and third modules are in the installation
      phase. The project is expected to be completed in 2007.

The
      aluminum beverage container continues to compete aggressively with other
      packaging materials in the beer and carbonated soft drink industries. The glass
      bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry, while carbonated
      soft
      drink and beer industry use of PET containers has grown. In Canada, metal
      beverage containers have captured significantly lower percentages of the
      packaged beverage industry than in the U.S., particularly in the packaged beer
      industry.

North
      American Metal Food Packaging

In
      addition to metal beverage containers, Ball produces two-piece and three-piece
      steel food containers for packaging vegetables, fruit, soups, meat, seafood,
      nutritional products, pet food and other products. These containers are
      manufactured in 11 plants in the U.S. and Canada and sold primarily to food
      processors in North America. In 2005 metal food container sales comprised
      14 percent of consolidated net sales. Sales volumes of metal food
      containers in North America tend to be highest from June through October as
      a
      result of seasonal vegetable and salmon packs. Approximately 32 billion
      steel food containers were shipped in the U.S. and Canada in 2005, approximately
      20 percent of which we estimate were shipped by Ball.

          2 of

In
      the company recorded a pretax charge of $4.6 million ($3.1 million
      after tax) related to a reduction in the work force in a metal food container
      plant in Ontario, Canada. Also in 2005, the company recorded a pretax charge
      of
      $6.6 million ($4.4 million after tax) for the closure of a three-piece
      food can manufacturing plant in Quebec, Canada. The Quebec plant was closed
      and
      ceased operations in the third quarter of 2005 and an agreement has been reached
      to sell the land and building.

On
      March 17, 2004, Ball acquired ConAgra Grocery Products Company’s (ConAgra)
      interest in Ball Western Can Company LLC (Ball Western Can) located in Oakdale,
      California, and entered into a multi-year supply contract with ConAgra Foods,
      Inc. Prior to the acquisition, Ball Western Can was a 50/50 joint venture
      between Ball and ConAgra and was accounted for under the equity method of
      accounting. The acquisition of Ball Western Can added approximately one billion
      units of annual capacity.

Competitors
      in the metal food container product line include two national and a few regional
      suppliers and self manufacturers. Several producers in Mexico also manufacture
      steel food containers. Steel food containers also compete with other packaging
      materials in the food industry including glass, aluminum, plastic, paper and
      the
      stand-up pouch. As a result, demand for this product line may be affected during
      the next few years and we must increasingly focus on product innovation and
      cost
      reduction. Service, quality and price are among the key competitive
      factors.

North
      American Plastic Packaging

PET
      containers represented 8 percent of consolidated net sales in 2005. Demand
      for containers made of PET has increased in the beverage and food markets,
      with
      improved barrier technologies and other advances. This growth in demand should
      continue, assuming adequate supplies of resin continue to be available. While
      PET beverage containers compete against metal, glass and paper, the historical
      increase in the sales of PET containers has come primarily at the expense of
      glass containers and through new market introductions. We estimate our 2005
      shipments of more than 5 billion plastic containers to be approximately
      9 percent of total U.S. and Canadian PET container shipments.

The
      company operates five PET facilities in the U.S. Competition in the PET
      container industry includes several national and regional suppliers and self
      manufacturers. Service, quality and price are important competitive factors.
      The
      ability to produce customized, differentiated plastic containers is becoming
      a
      key competitive factor.

Most
      of
      Ball’s PET containers are sold under long-term contracts to suppliers of bottled
      water and carbonated soft drinks, including bottlers of Pepsi-Cola branded
      beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups.
      Our
      plastic beer containers are being produced for several of our customers and
      we
      are manufacturing plastic containers for the single serve juice and
      wine markets. Our line of Heat-Tek(TM) PET plastic bottles for hot-filled
      beverages, such as sports drinks and juices, includes sizes from 8 ounces to
      ounces.

International
      Packaging

The
      international packaging segment, which accounted for 24 percent of Ball’s
      consolidated net sales in 2005,

consists
      of 10 beverage can plants and two beverage can end plants in Europe, as
      well as operations in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Of the
      12 European plants, four are located in Germany, three in the United
      Kingdom, two in France and one each in the Netherlands, Poland and Serbia.
      In
      total the European plants produced approximately 12 billion cans in 2005,
      with approximately 50 percent of those being produced from steel and
      50 percent from aluminum. Six of the can plants use aluminum and four use
      steel.

Ball
      Packaging Europe is the second largest metal beverage container producer in
      Europe, with an estimated 29 percent of European shipments, and produces
      two-piece beverage cans and can ends for producers of beer, carbonated soft
      drinks, mineral water, fruit juices, energy drinks and other
      beverages. Ball Packaging Europe is the largest metal beverage container
      manufacturer in Germany, France and the Benelux countries and the second largest
      metal beverage container manufacturer in the United Kingdom and Poland. Near
      the
      end of the second quarter of 2005, Ball completed the construction of a new
      aluminum beverage can manufacturing plant in Belgrade, Serbia, to serve the
      growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern
      Europe.

          3 of

As
      in
      North America, the metal beverage container continues to compete aggressively
      with other packaging materials used by the European beer and carbonated soft
      drink industries. The glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer
      industry, while the PET container is increasingly utilized in the carbonated
      soft drink, juice and mineral water industries.

Due
      to
      political and legal uncertainties in Germany, no nationwide system for returning
      beverage containers was in place at the time a mandatory deposit was imposed
      in
      January 2003 and nearly all retailers stopped carrying beverages in
      non-refillable containers. During 2003 and 2004, we responded to the resulting
      lower demand for beverage cans by reducing production at our German plants,
      implementing aggressive cost reduction measures and increasing exports from
      Germany to other countries in the region served by Ball Packaging Europe. We
      also closed a plant in the United Kingdom, shut down a production line in
      Germany, delayed capital investment projects in France and Poland and converted
      one of our steel can production lines in Germany to aluminum in order to
      facilitate additional can exports from Germany. In 2004 the German parliament
      adopted a new packaging ordinance, imposing a 25 eurocent deposit on all one-way
      glass, PET and metal containers for water, beer and carbonated soft drinks.
      As
      of May 1, 2006, all retailers must redeem all returned one-way containers as
      long as they sell such containers. Major retailers in Germany have begun the
      process of implementing a returnable system for one-way containers since they,
      along with fillers, now appear to accept the deposit as permanent.  The
      retailers and the filling and packaging industries have formed a committee
      to
      design a nationwide recollection system and several retailers have begun to
      order reverse vending machines in order to meet the May 1, 2006,
      deadline.

The
      European beverage can business is capital intensive, requiring significant
      investments in machinery and equipment. Profitability is sensitive to selling
      prices, foreign exchange rates, transportation costs, production volumes, labor
      and the costs and availability of certain raw materials, such as aluminum and
      steel. The European aluminum and steel industries are highly consolidated with
      three steel suppliers and three aluminum suppliers providing 95 percent of
      European requirements. Material supply contracts are generally for a period
      of
      one year, although Ball Packaging Europe has negotiated some longer term
      agreements. Aluminum is purchased primarily in U.S. dollars while the functional
      currencies of Ball Packaging Europe and its subsidiaries are non-U.S. dollars.
      This inherently results in a foreign exchange rate risk, which the company
      minimizes through the use of derivative contracts. In addition, purchase and
      sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass-through pricing
      arrangements.

R&D
      efforts in Europe are directed toward the development of new sizes and types
      of
      metal containers, as well as new uses for the current containers. Other research
      and development objectives in this segment include improving manufacturing
      efficiencies. The European R&D activities are conducted in a technical
      center located in Bonn, Germany.

Through
      Ball Asia Pacific Limited, we are one of the largest beverage can manufacturers
      in the PRC and believe that our facilities are among the most modern in that
      country. Capacity grew rapidly in the PRC in the late 1990s, resulting in a
      supply/demand imbalance to which we responded by rationalizing capacity. Demand
      growth has resumed in the past few years with projected annual growth expected
      to be in the 5 to 10 percent range in the near term. Ball is also
      undertaking selected capacity increases in its existing facilities in order
      to
      participate in the projected growth. Our current operations include the
      manufacture of aluminum cans and ends in three plants and high-density plastic
      containers in two plants. Sales in the PRC represented 3 percent of
      consolidated net sales. We also participate in three joint ventures that
      manufacture aluminum cans and ends in Brazil and in the PRC. In the fourth
      quarter of 2004, we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts in respect
      of a
      receivable of a 35 percent owned joint venture in the PRC. In the first quarter
      of 2005, the remaining carrying value of the company’s investment in this joint
      venture was written off.

Aerospace
      and Technologies

The
      aerospace and technologies segment includes defense operations, civil space
      systems and commercial space operations. The defense operations business unit
      includes defense systems, systems engineering services, advanced antenna and
      video systems and electro-optics and cryogenic systems and components. Sales
      in
      the aerospace and technologies segment accounted for 12 percent of consolidated
      net sales in 2005.

The
      majority of the aerospace and technologies business involves work under
      contracts, generally from one to five years in duration, as a prime contractor
      or subcontractor for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),
      the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other U.S. government agencies.
      Contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented
      87 percent of segment sales in 2005. Geopolitical events and executive and
      legislative branch priorities have yielded considerable growth opportunities
      in
      areas matching our core capabilities. However, there is strong competition
      for
      new business.

Civil
      space systems, defense systems and commercial space operations include hardware,
      software and services sold primarily to U.S. customers, with emphasis on space
      science and exploration, environmental and Earth sciences, and defense and
      intelligence applications. Major contractual activities frequently involve
      the
      design, manufacture and testing of satellites, remote sensors and ground station
      control hardware and software, as well as related services such as launch
      vehicle integration and satellite operations.

Other
      hardware activities include: target identification, warning and attitude control
      systems and components; cryogenic systems for reactant storage, and sensor
      cooling devices using either closed-cycle mechanical refrigerators or open-cycle
      solid and liquid cryogens; star trackers, which are general-purpose stellar
      attitude sensors; and fast-steering mirrors. Additionally, the aerospace and
      technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to
      government agencies, prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad
      range of information warfare, electronic warfare, avionics, intelligence,
      training and space systems needs.

Backlog
      in the aerospace and technologies segment was $761 million and $694 million
      at
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and consists of the aggregate contract
      value of firm orders, excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue. The
      2005 backlog includes $458 million expected to be recognized in revenues during
      2006, with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues thereafter.
      Unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which
      are subject to annual funding were $500 million and $393 million at
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Year-to-year comparisons of
      backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations.

The
      company’s aerospace and technologies segment has contracts with the U.S.
      government or its contractors which have standard termination provisions. The
      government retains the right to terminate contracts at its convenience. However,
      if contracts are terminated in this manner, Ball is entitled to reimbursement
      for allowable costs and profits on authorized work performed through the date
      of
      termination. U.S. government contracts are also subject to reduction or
      modification in the event of changes in government requirements or budgetary
      constraints.

Patents

In
      the
      opinion of the company, none of its active patents is essential to the
      successful operation of its business as a whole.

Environment

Aluminum,
      steel and PET containers are recyclable, and significant amounts of used
      containers are being diverted from the solid waste stream and recycled. Using
      the most recent data available, in 2004 approximately 51 percent of
      aluminum containers, 62 percent of steel containers and 22 percent of
      the PET containers sold in the U.S. were recycled.

Recycling
      rates vary throughout Europe, but generally average 60 percent for aluminum
      and steel containers, which exceeds the European Union’s goal of 50 percent
      recycling for metals. Due in part to the intrinsic value of aluminum and steel,
      metal packaging recycling rates in Europe compare favorably to those of other
      packaging materials.

Compliance
      with federal, state and local laws relating to protection of the environment
      has
      not had a material, adverse effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings
      or
      competitive position of the company. As more fully described under Item 3,
      Legal
      Proceedings, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and various state
      environmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible
      party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous
      waste sites. However, the company’s information at this time indicates that
      these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity,
      results of operations or financial condition of the company.

Legislation
      which would prohibit, tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of
      containers, and would require diversion of solid wastes such as packaging
      materials from disposal in landfills, has been or may be introduced anywhere
      we
      operate. While container legislation has been adopted in some jurisdictions,
      similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies
      in numerous others. The company anticipates that continuing efforts will be
      made
      to consider and adopt such legislation in many jurisdictions in the future.
      If
      such legislation were widely adopted, it potentially could have a material
      adverse effect on the business of the company, as well as on the container
      manufacturing industry generally, in view of the company’s substantial global
      sales and investment in metal and PET container manufacturing. However, the
      packages we produce are widely used and perform well in U.S. states and Canadian
      provinces that have deposit systems.

Employees

At
      the
      end of December 2005 the company employed 13,100 people worldwide,
      including 9,000 employees in the U.S. and 4,100 in other countries. There
      are an additional 1,000 employees employed in unconsolidated joint ventures
      in which Ball participates. Approximately one-third of Ball's North American
      packaging plant employees are unionized and most of our European plant employees
      are union workers. Collective bargaining agreements with various unions in
      the
      U.S. have terms of three to five years and those in Europe have terms of one
      to
      two years. The agreements expire at regular intervals and are customarily
      renewed in the ordinary course after bargaining between union and company
      representatives. The company believes that its employee relations are good
      and
      that its training, education and retention practices assist in enhancing
      employee satisfaction levels.

Item
      1A. Risk Factors

Any
      of
      the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business,
      financial condition or results of operations.

The
      loss of a key customer could have a significant negative impact on our
      sales.

While
      we
      have diversified our customer base, we do sell a majority of our packaging
      products to relatively few major beverage and packaged food companies, some
      of
      which operate in North America, Europe and Asia.

Although
      approximately 70 percent of our customer contracts are long-term, these
      contracts are terminable under certain circumstances, such as our failure to
      meet quality or volume requirements. Because we depend on relatively few major
      customers, our business, financial condition or results of operations could
      be
      adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers, a reduction in the
      purchasing levels of these customers, a strike or work stoppage by a significant
      number of these customers' employees or an adverse change in the terms of the
      supply agreements with these customers.

The
      primary customers for our aerospace work are U.S. government agencies or their
      prime contractors. These sales represented approximately 11 percent of
      Ball's consolidated 2005 net sales. Our contracts with these customers are
      subject to, among other things, the following risks:

·

unilateral
                termination for convenience by the
                customers;

·

reduction
                or modification in the scope of the contracts due to changes in the
                customer's requirements or budgetary
                constraints;

·

under
                fixed-price contracts, increased or unexpected costs causing losses
                or
                reduced profits; and

·

under
                cost reimbursement contracts, unallowable costs causing losses or
                reduced
                profits.

Page
          7 of

We
      face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our
      profitability.

Competition
      within the packaging industry is intense. Increases in productivity, combined
      with surplus capacity in the industry, have maintained competitive pricing
      pressures. The principal methods of competition in the general packaging
      industry are price, service and quality. Some of our competitors may have
      greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Our current or potential
      competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed
      superior to ours.

We
      are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in
      lower
      profits and reduced cash flows.

The
      metal
      beverage can is subject to significant competition from substitute products,
      particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from PET, single serve
      beer bottles, and containers made of glass, cardboard or other materials.
      Competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense
      in the United States and the United Kingdom. There can be no assurance that
      we
      will successfully compete against alternative beverage containers which could
      result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow.

We
      have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our
      products decreased.

For
      the
      12 months ended December 31, 2005, 42 percent of our consolidated net
      sales were from the sale of metal beverage cans, and we expect to derive a
      significant portion of our future revenues from the sale of metal beverage
      cans.
      We sell no PET bottles in Europe. Our business would suffer if the use of metal
      beverage cans decreased. Accordingly, broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum
      and steel cans for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future
      success. If demand for glass and PET bottles increases relative to cans, or
      the
      demand for aluminum and steel cans does not develop as expected, our business,
      financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely
      affected.

Our
      business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks
      resulting from increased international operations.

We
      derived 24 percent of our total net sales from outside of North America in
      the year ended December 31, 2005. The increased scope of international
      operations may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more
      difficult for us to manage our business. Reasons for this include, but are
      not
      limited to, the following:

·

political
                and economic instability in foreign
                markets;

·

foreign
                governments' restrictive trade
                policies;

·

the
                imposition of duties, taxes or government
                royalties;

·

foreign
                exchange rate risks;

·

difficulties
                in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property
                rights; and

·

the
                geographic, time zone, language and cultural differences between
                personnel
                in different areas of the world.

Any
      of
      these factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial
      condition or results of operations.

We
      are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.

For
      the
      12 months ended December 31, 2005, 72 percent of our net sales were
      attributable to operations with U.S. dollars as their functional currency,
      and
      28 percent of our net sales were attributable to operations having other
      functional currencies, with 12 percent

of net
      sales attributable to the euro.

Our
        reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Historically, Ball's foreign operations,
        including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses, have been
        denominated in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we expect
        that
        our foreign operations will continue to be so denominated. As a result, the
        U.S.
        dollar value of Ball's foreign operations have varied, and will continue
        to
        vary, with exchange rate fluctuations. In this respect, historically Ball
        has
        been primarily exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro,
        British
        pound, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real and
        Serbian dinar.

Page
            8 of

A
      decrease in the value of any of these currencies, especially the euro, relative
      to the U.S. dollar could reduce our profits from foreign operations and the
      value of the net assets of our foreign operations when reported in U.S. dollars
      in our financial statements. This could have a material adverse effect on our
      business, financial condition or results of operations as reported in U.S.
      dollars.

In
      addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the
      earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period
      comparisons of our reported results of operations. For purposes of accounting,
      the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, where the local currency
      is the functional currency, are translated using period-end exchange rates,
      and
      the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated using average
      exchange rates during each period. Translation gains and losses are reported
      in
      accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of shareholders'
      equity.

We
      actively manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in order to
      mitigate the effect of foreign cash flow and reduce earnings volatility
      associated with foreign exchange rate changes. We primarily use forward
      contracts and options to manage our foreign currency exposures and, as a result,
      we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part,
      by
      the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities.

Our
      business, operating results and financial condition are subject to particular
      risks in certain regions of the world.

We
      may
      experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or
      more
      periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
      results or financial condition. Moreover, overcapacity, which often leads to
      lower prices, exists in a number of regions, including Asia and Latin America,
      and may persist even if demand grows. Our ability to manage such operational
      fluctuations and to maintain adequate long-term strategies in the face of such
      developments will be critical to our continued growth and
      profitability.

If
      we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement
      our
      key objectives.

We
      believe that our future success depends, in large part, on our experienced
      management team. Losing the services of key members of our management team
      could
      make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our
      objectives.

Decreases
      in our ability to apply new technology and know-how may affect our
      competitiveness.

Our
      success depends in part on our ability to improve production processes and
      services. We must also introduce new products and services to meet changing
      customer needs. If we are unable to implement better production processes or
      to
      develop new products, we may not be able to remain competitive with other
      manufacturers. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of
      operations could be adversely affected.

Bad
      weather and climate changes may result in lower
      sales.

We
      manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods. Unseasonably
      cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers.
      In addition, poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop
      yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food
      containers, creating potentially adverse effects on our
      business.

          9 of

We
      are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw
      materials.

We
      purchase aluminum, steel, plastic resin and other raw materials and packaging
      supplies from several sources. While all such materials are available from
      numerous independent suppliers, raw materials are subject to fluctuations in
      price attributable to a number of factors, including general economic
      conditions, the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the
      availability of complementary and substitute materials. Although we enter into
      commodities purchase agreements from time to time and use derivative instruments
      to hedge our risk, we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials
      will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities or at reasonable prices.
      Increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our
      business, financial condition or results of operations. Because our North
      American contracts often pass raw material costs directly on to the customer,
      increasing raw materials costs may not impact our near-term profitability but
      could decrease our sales volume over time. In Europe, our contracts do not
      typically allow us to pass on increased raw material costs and we regularly
      use
      derivative agreements to manage this risk; however, our hedging procedures
      may
      be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if materials costs
      increase suddenly in Europe.

Prolonged
      work stoppages at plants with union employees could jeopardize our financial
      position.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, approximately one-third of our employees in North America
      and
      most of our employees in Europe were covered by one or more collective
      bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements have staggered
      expirations over the next three years. Although we consider our employee
      relations to be generally good, a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any
      facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our
      business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we cannot
      assure you that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements
      new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new
      agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us.

Our
      business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance
      costs.

Our
      operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating
      to environmental hazards, such as emissions to air, discharges to water, the
      handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous
      substances. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated us, along
      with numerous other companies, as a potentially responsible party for the
      cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Based on available information, we
      do
      not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have
      a
      material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations,
      capital expenditures or competitive position.

If
      we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill, our net earnings
      and
      net worth could be materially adversely affected.

We
      have
      $1,258.6 million of net goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet
      as of December 31, 2005. We are required to periodically determine if our
      goodwill has become impaired, in which case we would write down the impaired
      portion of our goodwill. If we were required to write down all or part of our
      goodwill, our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely
      affected.

If
      the investments in Ball's pension plans do not perform as expected, we may
      have
      to contribute additional amounts to the plans, which would otherwise be
      available to cover operating expenses.

Ball
      maintains noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans covering substantially
      all of its U.S. employees, which we fund based on certain actuarial assumptions.
      The plans' assets consist primarily of common stocks and fixed income
      securities. If the investments in the plan do not perform at expected levels,
      then we will have to contribute additional funds to ensure that the program
      will
      be able to pay out benefits as scheduled. Such an increase in funding could
      result in a decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings and the
      recognition of such an increase could result in a reduction to our shareholders'
      equity. We recorded an increase in our minimum pension liability in the fourth
      quarter of 2005 largely as a reduction in the assumed discount rate. This
      increase in pension liability was reflected as an increase in other liabilities
      and a corresponding decrease in stockholders' equity.

Our
      significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us
      from
      fulfilling our obligations under the notes.

We
      have a
      significant amount of debt. On December 31, 2005, we had total debt of
      $1,589.7 million. Our ratio of earnings to fixed charges as of that date
      was 3.4 times (see Exhibit 12 attached to this Annual Report). Our high
      level of debt could have important consequences, including the
      following:

·

use
                of a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest
                on our
                notes, the new credit facilities and our other debt, which will reduce
                the
                availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital
                expenditures, research and development expenditures and other business
                activities;

·

increase
                our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry
                conditions;

·

limit
                our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business
                and the industry in which we
                operate;

·

restrict
                us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business
                opportunities;

·

place
                us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that
                have
                less debt;

·

limit
                our ability to make capital expenditures in order to maintain our
                manufacturing plants in good working order and repair;
                and

·

limit,
                along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt,
                among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose
                of
                assets or pay cash dividends.

In
      addition, a substantial portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates.
      If
      market interest rates increase, variable-rate debt will create higher debt
      service requirements, which would adversely affect our cash flow. While we
      sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure, any such agreements
      may
      not offer complete protection from this risk.

We
      will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt. Our ability
      to
      generate cash depends on many factors beyond our
      control.

Our
      ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, including the notes,
      and
      to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts,
      will
      depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general
      economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors
      that
      may be beyond our control.

Based
      on
      our current level of operations, we believe our cash flow from operations,
      available cash and available borrowings under our new credit facilities, will
      be
      adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for the next several years barring
      any unforeseen circumstances which are beyond our control.

We
      cannot
      assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from
      operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our new
      credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay
      our
      debt, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need
      to
      refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, on or before
      maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our
      debt, including our new credit facilities and our senior notes, on commercially
      reasonable terms or at all.

Properties

The
      company’s properties described below are well maintained, are considered
      adequate and are being utilized for their intended purposes.

Ball’s
      corporate headquarters and the Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. offices
      are located in Broomfield, Colorado. The Colorado-based operations of the
      aerospace and technologies business occupy a variety of company-owned and leased
      facilities in Broomfield, Boulder and Westminster, which together aggregate

Legal
      Proceedings

North
      America

As
      previously reported, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) considers
      the company a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) with respect to the Lowry
      Landfill site located east of Denver, Colorado. On June 12, 1992, the
      company was served with a lawsuit filed by the City and County of Denver
      (Denver) and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc., seeking contributions from
      the
      company and approximately 38 other companies. The company filed its answer
      denying the allegations of the complaint. On July 8, 1992, the company was
      served with a third-party complaint filed by S.W. Shattuck Chemical Company,
      Inc., seeking contribution from the company and other companies for the costs
      associated with cleaning up the Lowry Landfill. The company denied the
      allegations of the complaints.

In
      July
      1992 the company entered into a settlement and indemnification agreement with
      Chemical Waste Management, Inc., and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc.
      (collectively Waste Management) and Denver pursuant to which Waste Management
      and Denver dismissed their lawsuit against the company and Waste Management
      agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the company from claims and
      lawsuits brought by governmental agencies and other parties relating to actions
      seeking contributions or remedial costs from the company for the cleanup of
      the
      site. Several other companies, which are defendants in the above-referenced
      lawsuits, had already entered into the settlement and indemnification agreement
      with Waste Management and Denver. Waste Management, Inc., has agreed to
      guarantee the obligations for Chemical Waste Management, Inc., and Waste
      Management of Colorado, Inc. Waste Management and Denver may seek additional
      payments from the company if the response costs related to the site exceed
      $319 million. In 2003 Waste Management, Inc., indicated that the cost of
      the site might exceed $319 million in 2030, approximately three years
      before the projected completion of the project. The company might also be
      responsible for payments (based on 1992 dollars) for any additional wastes
      which
      may have been disposed of by the company at the site but which are identified
      after the execution of the settlement agreement. While remediating the site,
      contaminants were encountered which could add an additional cleanup cost of
      approximately $10 million. This additional cleanup cost could, in turn, add
      approximately $1 million to total site costs for the PRP
      group.

At
      this
      time, there are no Lowry Landfill actions in which the company is actively
      involved. Based on the information available to the company at this time, the
      company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect
      upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the
      company.

The
      company previously reported that, on August 1, 1997, the USEPA sent notice
      of potential liability to 19 PRPs concerning past activities at one or more
      of the four Rocky Flats parcels (including land owned by Precision Chemicals
      now
      owned by Great Western Inorganics) at the Rocky Flats Industrial Park site
      (RFIP) located in Jefferson County, Colorado. The RFIP site also includes the
      American Ecological Recycling and Research

Company (AERRCO)
      site and a site owned by Thoro Products Company. Based upon sampling at the
      site
      in 1996, the USEPA determined that additional site work would be required to
      determine the extent of contamination and the possible cleanup of the site.
      In
      1996 the USEPA requested that the PRPs perform certain site work. On
      December 19, 1997, the USEPA issued an Administrative Order on Consent
      (AOC) to conduct engineering estimates and cost analyses. The company has funded
      approximately $70,000 toward these costs. The PRPs have negotiated an
      agreement and the company contributed $5,000 as an initial group
      contribution. The company has agreed to pay 12 percent of the costs of
      cleanup at the AERRCO site and a percentage of the cleanup costs on the Thoro
      site. On January 8, 2003, and October 9, 2003, the company made
      additional payments of $97,200 each (total $194,400) toward the cost of cleanup.
      The company paid $35,355 in 2004 toward the cleanup. The air sparge and
      soil vapor extraction system was installed at a total cost of $1.1 million
      and was placed in operation in May 2005. Based on the information, or lack
      thereof, available to the company at the present time, the company does not
      believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity,
      results of operations or financial condition of the company.

As
      previously reported, in October 2001 representatives of Vauxmont Intermountain
      Communities (Vauxmont) notified six of the PRPs at the AERRCO site, including
      the company (AERRCO PRPs), that hazardous materials might have contaminated
      property owned by Vauxmont. The AERRCO site is contained within the RFIP site.
      Vauxmont also alleges that it lost $7 million on a contract with a home
      developer for the purchase of a portion of the land. Vauxmont representatives
      requested that the AERRCO PRPs study any contamination to the Vauxmont real
      estate. The AERRCO PRPs agreed to undertake such a study and sought the USEPA’s
      final approval. The sampling results were made available to all parties. No
      further claims have been made against the company by Vauxmont to date. Based
      on
      the information, or lack thereof, available to the company at the present time,
      the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse
      effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of
      the
      company.

As
      previously reported, during July 1992, the company received information that
      it
      had been named a PRP with respect to the Solvents Recovery of New England Site
      (SRSNE) located in Southington, Connecticut. According to the information
      received, it is alleged that the company contributed approximately
      0.08816 percent of the waste contributed to the site on a volumetric basis.
      The PRP group has been involved in negotiations with the USEPA regarding the
      remediation of the site. The company has paid approximately $17,500 toward
      site investigation and remediation efforts. The PRP group spent $15 million
      through the end of 2001. Approximately $1.5 million more was spent to
      complete a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study and pay for
      remediation work through 2003. As of December 2001, projected remediation cost
      estimates for a bioremediation and enhanced oxidation system ranged from
      $20 million to $30 million. The PRP group offered a $5.5 million
      settlement to resolve the USEPA claim of $16 million for past costs at the
      SRSNE site. PRP/USEPA negotiations to resolve the past cost claims from the
      USEPA have not been resolved and are not being actively pursued by the PRP
      group. A natural resources damage claim of approximately $3 million is
      anticipated. USEPA gave final approval for a $29 million remediation plan for
      the site on October 11, 2005. The company will be responsible for
      approximately 0.00109 percent of the future site costs. Based on the
      information, or lack thereof, available to the company at the present time,
      the
      company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect
      upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the
      company.

On
      December 30, 2002, the company received a 104(e) letter from the USEPA
      pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability
      Act (CERCLA) requesting answers to certain questions regarding the waste
      disposal practices of Heekin Can Company and the relationship between the
      company and Heekin Can Company. Region 5 of the USEPA is involved in the cleanup
      of the Jackson Brothers Paint Company site, which consists of four, and possibly
      five, sites in and around Laurel, Indiana. The Jackson Brothers Paint Company
      apparently disposed of drums of waste in those sites during the 1960s and 1970s.
      The USEPA has alleged that some of the waste that has been uncovered was sent
      to
      the sites from the Cincinnati plant operated by Heekin Can Company. The Indiana
      Department of Environmental Management referred this matter to the USEPA for
      removal of the drums and cleanup. At the present time there are an undetermined
      number of drums at one or more of the sites that have been initially identified
      by the USEPA as originating from Heekin Can Company. The USEPA has sent 104(e)
      letters to seven PRPs including Heekin Can Company. On January 30, 2003,
      the company responded to the request for information pursuant to
      Section 104(e) of CERCLA. The USEPA has initially estimated cleanup costs
      to be between $4 million and $5 million. Based on the information, or
      lack thereof, available to the company at the present time, the company does
      not
      believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity,
      results of operations or financial condition of the company.

As
      previously reported, on October 6, 2005, Ball Metal Beverage Container
      Corp. (BMBCC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, was served with an
      amended complaint filed by Crown Packaging Technology, Inc. et. al.
      (Crown), in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western
      Division at Dayton, Ohio. The complaint alleges that the manufacture, sale
      and
      use of certain ends by BMBCC and its customers infringes certain claims of
      Crown’s U.S. patents. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, fees,
      and declaratory and injunctive relief. BMBCC has formally denied the allegations
      of the complaint. Based on the information available to the company at the
      present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material
      adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition
      of the company.

On
      November 21, 2005, Ball Plastic Container Corp. (BPCC), a wholly owned
      subsidiary of the company, was served with a complaint filed by Constar
      International Inc. (Constar) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District
      of Wisconsin. The complaint alleges that the manufacture and sale of plastic
      bottles having oxygen barrier properties infringes certain claims of a Constar
      U.S. patent. Constar also sued Honeywell International Inc., the supplier of
      the
      oxygen barrier material to BPCC. The complaint seeks monetary damages, fees
      and
      declaratory and injunctive relief. BPCC has formally denied the allegations
      of
      the complaint. Based on the information available to the company at the present
      time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse
      effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or the financial condition
      of
      the company.

Europe

Ball
      Packaging Europe (BPE), together with other plaintiffs, is contesting in federal
      and state administrative courts the enactment of a mandatory deposit for
      non-refillable containers based on the German Packaging Regulation
      (Verpackungsverordnung). The proceedings in the State Administrative Court
      are
      still active in two states (Bavaria and Hamburg), and the proceedings in the
      other states have been declared inactive or have been retracted. The Federal
      Constitutional Court in Karsruhe (Bundesverfassungsgericht) has denied the
      motions of the plaintiffs for judgment. At the federal level, a proceeding
      with
      the Administrative Court in Berlin (Verwaltungsgericht Berlin) is still pending.
      BPE filed a motion for an expedited procedure with the objective of reinstating
      the suspensive effect of the procedure. The Administrative Court has denied
      the
      motion. BPE has filed an appeal against this decision with the Higher
      Administrative Court in Berlin (Oberverwaltungsgericht Berlin), which also
      denied the motion. The potential financial risk of legal fees, which BPE may
      incur in connection with the procedures set out above, amounts to approximately
      €280,000 and has been accrued by BPE. The European Court of Justice has issued
      a
      judgment that confirmed that the German deposit legislation violated, among
      other European Union (EU) regulations, the principle of free trade of goods
      within the EU and disadvantaged the importers of beverages versus German
      beverage producers. Following this judgment, two German law firms have suggested
      that importers of beverages and possibly even local beverage producers may
      be
      able to market beverages in Germany without mandatory deposit until a
      Germany-wide functioning return system is implemented. The German government
      does not share this point of view and has indicated that it will continue to
      apply the mandatory deposit regulations.

In
      December 2004 the German government passed new legislation that imposes a
      mandatory deposit of 25 eurocents on nonrefillable containers in respect of
      all beverages except milk, wine, fruit juices and certain alcoholic beverages.
      Beverages in beverage carton packaging are also excluded from the deposit.
      The
      legislation required that the so-called “island solutions” are to be terminated
      after an interim period of 12 months after the legislation takes effect.
      The new legislation came into force in May 2005. Island solutions therefore
      will
      no longer be permissible as of May 1, 2006. The relevant industries,
      including BPE and its competitors, are currently setting up a Germany-wide
      return system planned to be operational in or about May 2006. Based upon the
      information, or lack thereof, available to the company at the present time,
      the
      company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect
      upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the
      company.

Management’s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations

Management’s
      discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
      financial statements and accompanying notes. Ball Corporation and its
      subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “Ball” or “the company” or “we” and
“our” in the following discussion and analysis.

BUSINESS
      OVERVIEW

Ball
      Corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal and plastic
      packaging to the beverage and food industries. Our packaging products are
      produced for a variety of end uses and are currently manufactured in
      49 plants around the world. We also supply aerospace and other technologies
      and services to governmental and commercial customers.

We
      sell
      our packaging products primarily to major beverage and food producers with
      which
      we have developed long-term customer relationships. This is evidenced by our
      high customer retention and our large number of long-term supply contracts.
      While we have diversified our customer base, we do sell a majority of our
      packaging products to relatively few major beverage and food companies in North
      America, Europe and the People’s Republic of China (PRC), as do our equity joint
      ventures in Brazil, the U.S. and the PRC. We also purchase raw materials from
      relatively few suppliers. Because of our customer and supplier concentration,
      our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
      affected by the loss of a major customer or supplier or a material change in
      a
      supply agreement with a major customer or supplier, although our long-term
      relationships and contracts mitigate these risks.

In
      the
      rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs,
      developing new products, expanding volume and increasing pricing where possible.
      We are in the early stages of a project to upgrade and streamline our North
      American beverage can end manufacturing capabilities, a project that will result
      in productivity gains and cost reductions. While the U.S. and Canadian beverage
      container manufacturing industry is relatively mature, the European, PRC and
      Brazilian beverage can markets are growing (excluding the effects of the German
      mandatory deposit discussed in Note 21 to the consolidated financial
      statements) and are expected to continue to grow. We are capitalizing on the
      European growth by continuing to reconfigure some of our European can
      manufacturing lines and by opening in 2005 a new beverage can manufacturing
      plant in Belgrade, Serbia.

Ball’s
      consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We
      attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial
      instruments, as discussed in the “Financial Instruments and Risk Management”
sections (within Item 7A and Item 8, Note 16, of this report).

As
      part
      of our packaging strategy, we are focused on developing and marketing new and
      existing products that meet the ever-expanding needs of our beverage and food
      customers. These innovations include new shapes, sizes, opening features and
      other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging. This packaging
      development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with
      major beverage and food customers.

The
      primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and
      technologies segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors.
      It
      is possible that federal budget reductions and priorities, or changes in agency
      budgets, could limit future funding and new contract awards or prolong contract
      performance.

We
      recognize sales under long-term contracts in the aerospace and technologies
      segment using the cost-to-cost, percentage of completion method of accounting.
      Our present contract mix consists of approximately two-thirds cost-plus
      contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon profit component,
      and approximately one-third fixed price contracts. We include time and
      material contracts in the fixed price category because such contracts typically
      provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates. Throughout
      the
      period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary,
      revise our estimates of total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress
      toward completion. Because of contract payment schedules, limitations on funding
      and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this segment
      include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.

          19 of

Management
      uses various measures to evaluate company performance. The primary financial
      measures we use are earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before
      interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), diluted earnings per
      share, economic value added (operating earnings after tax, as defined by the
      company, less a capital charge based on invested capital times our cost of
      capital), operating cash flow and free cash flow (generally defined by the
      company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures).
      These
      financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability
      between periods. Nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include
      production spoilage rates, quality control measures, safety statistics and
      production and shipment volumes. Additional measures used to evaluate
      performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue
      realization, award and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog
      (including awarded, contracted and funded backlog).

We
      recognize that attracting and retaining quality employees is critically
      important to the success of Ball and, because of this, we strive to pay
      employees competitively and encourage their prudent ownership of the company’s
      common stock. For most management employees, a meaningful portion of
      compensation is at risk as an incentive, dependent upon economic value added
      operating performance. For more senior positions, more compensation is at risk.
      Through our employee stock purchase plan and 401(k) plan, which matches employee
      contributions with Ball common stock, many employees, regardless of
      organizational level, have opportunities to participate as Ball
      shareholders.

CONSOLIDATED
      SALES AND EARNINGS

The
      company has determined that it has five reportable segments organized
      along a combination of product lines and geographic areas - North
      American metal beverage packaging, North American metal food packaging, North
      American plastic packaging, international packaging and aerospace and
      technologies. Prior periods have been conformed to the current presentation.
      We
      also have investments in companies in the U.S., the PRC and Brazil, which are
      accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and accordingly, their
      results are not included in segment sales or earnings.

North
      American Metal Beverage Packaging

The
      North
      American metal beverage packaging segment consists of operations located in
      the
      U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, which manufacture metal container products used
      primarily in beverage packing. This segment accounted for 42 percent of
      consolidated net sales in 2005 (43 percent in 2004). Sales were slightly
      higher in 2005 than in 2004 as lower 2005 sales volumes were offset by higher
      aluminum prices passed through to our customers. Metal beverage container
      volumes in 2005 were 2.5 percent below the previous year’s levels as a
      result of poor weather in the first quarter, temporary volume reductions and
      general softness in the beer and carbonated soft drink markets. Net changes
      in
      contracted volumes are expected to result in the restoration of the reduced
      2005 volumes during 2006 and beyond. Sales were 3 percent higher in
      2004 than in 2003. Contributing to the increase were the pass through of
      aluminum price increases and higher volumes in our specialty can products,
      partially offset by declines in standard 12-ounce can volumes. Sales in 2004
      improved over 2003 due to the $28 million acquisition in March 2003 of
      Metal Packaging International, Inc., a small producer of metal beverage can
      ends. Based on publicly available information, we estimate that our shipments
      of
      metal beverage containers were approximately 31 percent of total U.S. and
      Canadian shipments in 2005.

We
      continue to focus efforts on the growing custom beverage can business, which
      includes cans of different shapes, diameters and fill volumes, and cans with
      added functional attributes for new products and product line extensions. The
      conversion of a manufacturing line in our Golden, Colorado, plant from 12-ounce
      to 24-ounce cans was completed in the second quarter of 2005. We also announced
      plans to convert a line in our Monticello, Indiana, plant from 12-ounce can
      manufacturing to a line capable of producing beverage cans in sizes up to
      16 ounces. This conversion was substantially completed in
      January 2006.

Earnings
      in the segment were $229.8 million in 2005 compared to $279.1 million
      in 2004 and $250.8 million in 2003. The third quarter of 2005 included a
      pretax charge of $19.3 million ($11.7 million after tax) related to a
      project to significantly upgrade and streamline our North American beverage
      can
      end manufacturing capabilities. The charge included the write off of obsolete
      equipment spare parts and tooling, as well as employee termination costs. Over
      time, this capital project is expected to result in productivity improvements
      and reduced manufacturing costs.

          20 of

We
      have
      installed the first production module in this multi-year project and the second
      and third modules are in the installation phase. The project is expected to
      be
      completed in 2007.

Also
      contributing to lower segment earnings in 2005 were higher freight costs from
      fuel surcharges, higher other direct material and utility costs and a
      $9 million increase in cost of sales due to rising raw material costs under
      the LIFO (last-in-first-out) method of accounting. Energy, freight and other
      direct material costs were $32 million higher in 2005 than in 2004,
      partially offset by efficiency gains, cost controls and lower selling, general
      and administrative costs in 2005. While pricing pressures continue on our raw
      materials, other direct materials, and freight and utility costs, we continue
      to
      work with both customers and suppliers to maintain our volumes, as well as
      preserve our margins.

The
      improvement in segment earnings in 2004 versus 2003 was the result of higher
      sales and production volumes, improved product mix and cost reduction programs.
      Partially offsetting these 2004 earnings improvements was an increase in cost
      of
      sales due to rising raw material costs under the LIFO (last-in-first-out) method
      of accounting. In the fourth quarter of 2003, a gain of $1.6 million was
      recorded in connection with the sale of a metal beverage container facility
      that
      was shut down in December 2001.

North
      American Metal Food Packaging

The
      North
      American metal food packaging segment consists of operations located in the
      U.S.
      and Canada, which manufacture metal container products used primarily in food
      packaging. Segment sales in 2005 comprised 14 percent of consolidated net
      sales (14 percent in 2004) and were 6 percent higher than 2004 sales.
      Sales in 2005 reflected higher prices from the pass through of higher raw
      material costs. Sales volumes were flat compared to 2004 levels including,
      in
      the first quarter of 2005, the inclusion of a full quarter’s results from our
      Oakdale, California, facility which was acquired in March 2004 (discussed
      below). Sales were higher in 2004 than in 2003 due primarily to the acquisition
      of the Oakdale, California, facility, higher selling prices as a result of
      the
      pass through of raw material costs and some pre-buying by customers in the
      fourth quarter of 2004 ahead of expected 2005 steel price increases. During
      and 2005, we were able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases
      and surcharges levied by steel producers. We estimate our 2005 shipments of
      6.7 billion cans to be approximately 20 percent of total U.S. and
      Canadian metal food container shipments, based on publicly available trade
      information.

On
      March
      17, 2004, we acquired ConAgra Grocery Products Company’s (ConAgra) interest in
      Ball Western Can Company LLC (Ball Western Can) for $30 million. Ball
      Western Can, located in Oakdale, California, was established in 2000 as a 50/50
      joint venture between Ball and ConAgra and, prior to the acquisition, was
      accounted for by Ball using the equity method of accounting. Ball and ConAgra’s
      parent company, ConAgra Foods Inc., signed a long-term agreement under which
      Ball provides metal food containers to ConAgra food packing locations in
      California. The acquisition of Ball Western Can added approximately one billion
      units of annual capacity.

Segment
      earnings were $11.6 million in 2005 compared to $44.3 million in 2004
      and $19.8 million in 2003. The fourth quarter of 2005 included a pretax
      charge of $4.6 million ($3.1 million after tax) for pension, severance
      and other employee benefit costs related to a reduction in force in our
      Burlington, Ontario, plant. The second quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge
      of $8.8 million ($5.9 million after tax) for the closure of a
      three-piece food can manufacturing plant in Quebec. This action was taken to
      better match capacity to demand. The Quebec plant was closed and ceased
      operations in the third quarter of 2005 and an agreement has been reached to
      sell the land and building, which resulted in the second quarter charge being
      offset by a $2.2 million gain ($1.5 million after tax) in the fourth
      quarter to adjust the Quebec plant to net realizable value.

Also
      contributing to lower segment earnings in 2005 were higher freight costs from
      fuel surcharges, higher other direct material and utility costs and an
      $8.5 million increase in cost of sales due to rising raw material costs
      under the LIFO (last-in-first-out) method of accounting. Energy, freight and
      other direct material costs were $16 million higher in 2005 than in 2004,
      partially offset by efficiency gains, cost controls and lower selling, general
      and administrative costs in 2005. While pricing pressures continue on all of
      our
      raw materials, other direct materials, and freight and utility costs, we
      continue to work with both customers and suppliers to maintain our volumes,
      as
      well as preserve our margins.

Page
            21 of

The
      improvement in earnings in 2004 versus 2003 was the result of strong fourth
      quarter 2004 food can sales, higher production volumes, improved product mix
      and
      cost reduction programs. In addition, 2003 earnings were negatively impacted
      by
      $11 million of start-up costs associated with a new two-piece food can
      manufacturing line in Milwaukee. Partially offsetting these 2004 earnings
      improvements was an increase in cost of sales due to rising raw material costs
      under the LIFO (last-in-first-out) method of accounting. In the first quarter
      of
      2003, a net charge of $1.4 million was booked to record the costs of
      closing a metal food container plant offset by a gain from the sale of a
      previously closed plant.

North
      American Plastic Packaging

The
      North
      American plastic packaging segment consists of operations located in the U.S.
      which manufacture polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic container products
      used mainly in beverage packaging. Segment sales in 2005 comprised
      8 percent of consolidated sales (7 percent in 2004) and increased
      22 percent compared to 2004. The sales increase was related to the pass
      through to our customers of higher resin prices, as well as 7.5 percent
      higher sales volumes in 2005 compared to 2004, related to higher demand for
      barrier and heat-set containers that provide longer shelf-life for products,
      combined with strong demand for plastic water bottles. Sales in 2004 were
      7 percent higher than in 2003, primarily as a result of several new preform
      sales contracts secured during 2004 and the pass through of raw material price
      increases. Carbonated soft drink and water sales volumes in 2004 were lower
      than
      expected primarily due to reduced demand on the East Coast, resulting from
      competitive pressures, and a delay in the commencement of a new customer supply
      opportunity on the West Coast. Although only a small percentage of our total
      volume, juice, sports drinks and beer container sales increased in 2005 and
      are
      expected to grow considerably in the future as more focus is given to these
      specialty markets and the development of our Heat-Tek(TM) business. We estimate
      our 2005 shipments of more than 5 billion bottles to be approximately
      9 percent of total U.S. and Canadian PET container shipments.

Segment
      earnings were $17.4 million in 2005 compared to $11.6 million in 2004
      and $12.3 million in 2003. The improvement in earnings in 2005 was the
      result of higher sales and production volumes and growth in specialty products.
      Partially offsetting these improvements in 2005 were higher utility costs.
      Segment earnings in 2004 and 2003 included $2 million and
      $2.7 million, respectively, of costs associated with the relocation of the
      plastics offices and research and development facility from Atlanta, Georgia,
      to
      Colorado. Earnings in 2004 were also negatively impacted by continued pricing
      pressures on commodity plastic containers for carbonated soft drink customers.
      Segment earnings in 2004 also included a gain of $0.7 million as costs related
      to the shut down and relocation of the Atlanta plastics offices were less than
      expected.

International
      Packaging

International
      packaging includes the production and sale of metal beverage container products
      manufactured and sold in Europe and Asia as well as plastic containers
      manufactured and sold in Asia. This segment accounted for 24 percent of
      consolidated net sales in 2005 (23 percent in 2004).

Ball
      Packaging Europe, which represents an estimated 29 percent of the total
      European metal beverage container manufacturing capacity, has manufacturing
      plants located in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Poland
      and Serbia. European sales were 7 percent higher in 2005 than in 2004
      primarily as a result of an 8.5 percent increase in sales volumes. The
      continued weak demand in Germany, as a result of the mandatory deposit
      legislation previously reported on, is being offset by stronger demand elsewhere
      in Europe, including southern and eastern Europe. Sales in 2005 were adversely
      affected by unseasonably cool, wet weather in parts of Europe. European sales
      were 10 percent higher in 2004 than in 2003 as a result of a stronger euro,
      higher selling prices and successful export programs from the German plants
      to
      other European countries.

In
      response to increased demand for custom cans in Europe, a steel can
      manufacturing line in the Netherlands was converted to aluminum custom cans
      during the first quarter of 2005. The construction of a new beverage can plant
      in Belgrade, Serbia, was completed near the end of the second quarter of 2005
      to
      serve the growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern Europe.
      The
      plant became fully operational during the third quarter of 2005. The Serbian
      plant was constructed to accommodate a second can production line and a can
      end
      manufacturing module for future growth. In the first quarter of 2004, a steel
      can manufacturing line in Germany was converted to the production of aluminum
      cans and, in the first quarter of 2003, one German can manufacturing line was
      idled.

Sales
      in
      the PRC in 2005 increased 21 percent over 2004 levels, which were
      18 percent higher than in 2003. The increases were largely the result of
      higher volumes. The overall beverage can market in the PRC was also strong
      throughout 2005 with expectations of continued growth into 2006. We expect
      demand for aluminum beverage cans to grow in the coming years, as both
      multinational and Chinese beverage fillers expand their markets.

International
      packaging segment earnings of $181.8 million in 2005 decreased
      8 percent compared to 2004 earnings of $198 million. The fourth
      quarter of 2005 included a $9.3 million gain primarily resulting from the
      final settlement of all tax obligations related to liquidated China operations
      for amounts less than originally estimated. First quarter 2005 segment earnings
      included a $3.4 million expense for the write off of the remaining carrying
      value of an equity investment in the PRC. Earnings in 2004 included income
      of
      $13.7 million related to the realization of proceeds on assets in the PRC
      being in excess of amounts previously estimated, and costs of liquidation being
      less than anticipated in a business consolidation charge taken in 2001.

Higher
      material, energy and transportation costs, as well as second and third quarter
      start up costs related to a line conversion in the Netherlands and the new
      Serbia plant had a negative effect on 2005 segment earnings. Partially
      offsetting these higher costs were lower selling, general and administrative
      costs. Earnings improved in 2004 compared to 2003 due to a stronger euro and
      higher profit margins in both Europe and the PRC due in large part to
      operational cost reduction programs. Segment earnings in 2004 were also improved
      over 2003 by the nonrecurrence of purchase accounting adjustments which
      increased Ball Packaging Europe’s cost of sales in 2003. The stronger euro
      improved our net earnings per diluted share by $0.08 in 2004 compared to
      2003.

During
      the fourth quarter of 2004, Sanshui Jianlibao FTB Packaging Limited (Sanshui
      JFP), a 35 percent owned PRC joint venture, experienced a greater than customary
      seasonal production slowdown caused by cash flow difficulties. After discussions
      with representatives of the local Chinese government, which had temporarily
      taken control of our joint venture partner’s business, we recorded an allowance
      for doubtful accounts in respect of Sanshui JFP’s receivable from the joint
      venture partner. Our share of the bad debt provision amounted to
      $15.2 million and is included in the 2004 consolidated statement of
      earnings as equity in results of affiliates. Information learned late in the
      first quarter of 2005 led the company to record expense of $3.4 million to
      write off the remaining carrying value of this investment.

In
      June 2001 we announced a plan to exit the general line metal can business
      in the PRC and reduce our PRC beverage can manufacturing capacity by closing
      two
      plants. A $237.7 million pretax charge ($185 million after tax and
      minority interest impact) was recorded in connection with this reorganization.
      We recorded earnings of $9.3 million during 2005, $13.7 million in
      2004 and $3.3 million in 2003 as restructuring activities were completed,
      resulting in realization on assets in excess of amounts previously estimated,
      as
      well as costs incurred being less than estimated, including settlement of tax
      matters. All costs and transactions related to the PRC restructuring have been
      concluded.

Aerospace
      and Technologies

Aerospace
      and technologies segment sales represented 12 percent of 2005 consolidated
      net sales (12 percent in 2004) and were 6 percent higher than in 2004.
      Sales in 2004 were 22 percent higher than in 2003. The progressively higher
      sales resulted from a combination of newly awarded contracts and additions
      to
      previously awarded contracts. The aerospace and technologies business won a
      number of large, strategic contracts and delivered a great deal of sophisticated
      space and defense instrumentation throughout the three-year period. Earnings
      of
      $54.7 million in 2005 were 12 percent higher compared to 2004 despite
      an expense of $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2005 for the write down
      to net realizable value of an equity investment in an aerospace company. This
      investment was sold in October 2005 for approximately its carrying value.
      The improvement in earnings was primarily the result of higher sales and
      improved program performance. Net earnings decreased in 2004 by 2 percent
      compared to 2003 largely due to increased pension costs and higher costs
      incurred on certain cost-plus contracts without corresponding additional fees
      as
      these contracts reached completion. In addition, 2003 margins included
      $8 million due to successfully achieving milestones in two key
      programs.

On
      July 4, 2005, the Deep Impact spacecraft accomplished its goal of
      collecting data from comet Tempel 1, 83 million miles from Earth,
      using an impactor spacecraft to strike the comet and recording the results
      of
      the impact with a flyby spacecraft. The Deep Impact mission has provided
      groundbreaking scientific information regarding the origins of the solar system.
      Some of the segment’s other high-profile contracts include: WorldView, an
      advanced commercial remote sensing satellite; the James Webb Space Telescope,
      a
      successor to the Hubble Space Telescope; the Space-Based Space Surveillance
      System, which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital
      debris; NPOESS, the next-generation satellite weather monitoring system; and
      a
      number of antennas for the Joint Strike Fighter.

Sales
      to
      the U.S. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as
      a
      subcontractor, represented 87 percent of segment sales in 2005,
      82 percent in 2004 and 96 percent of segment sales in 2003.

The
      percentage representing U.S. government sales has decreased compared to 2003
      due
      to growing revenues related to the WorldView contract.

Contracted
      backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at December 31, 2005 and
      2004, was $761 million and $694 million, respectively. Year-to-year
      comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future
      operations.

For
      additional information regarding the company’s segments, see the summary of
      business segment information in Note 2 accompanying the consolidated financial
      statements within Item 8 of this report. The charges recorded for business
      consolidation activities were based on estimates by Ball management, actuaries
      and other independent parties and were developed from information available
      at
      the time. If actual outcomes vary from the estimates, the differences will
      be
      reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings
      and identified as business consolidation gains and losses. Additional details
      about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided
      in
      Note 4 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within
      Item 8 of this report.

Selling
      and Administrative Expenses

Selling
      and administrative expenses were $231.6 million, $267.9 million and
      $234.2 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Expenses in 2005 were
      lower in all areas of the company due largely to lower employee compensation
      and
      benefit costs, including the company’s deposit share program and
      economic-value-added based incentive compensation plans. In addition, foreign
      currency hedging gains were higher in 2005 than in 2004. These lower costs
      were
      partially offset by higher pension costs, higher accounts receivable
      securitization fees and the write down of the PRC and aerospace equity
      investments in the first quarter of 2005. The increase in 2004 compared to
      was due to higher costs related to the company’s deposit share program, higher
      pension and incentive costs, costs associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance
      in
      2004, higher research and development costs, the effects of foreign exchange
      rates and growth in our aerospace and technologies segment. In 2005 we reduced
      our U.S. pension plan discount rate from 6.25 percent to 6 percent,
      resulting in $5.4 million higher U.S. pension expense for the year compared
      to 2004, most of which was included in cost of sales. In 2004 we also reduced
      our U.S. pension plan discount rate from 6.75 percent to 6.25 percent,
      resulting in $8.3 million higher U.S. pension expense for the year compared
      to 2003.

For
      the
      U.S. pension plans, we intend to maintain our current return on asset assumption
      at 8.5 percent for 2006 while further reducing the discount rate assumption
      to 5.75 percent. Based on these assumptions, U.S. pension expense for 2006
      is anticipated to increase $10.5 million compared to 2005, most of which
      will be included in cost of sales. Pension expense in Europe and Canada combined
      is expected to be slightly lower than the 2005 expense. A reduction of the
      plan
      asset return assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in
      additional expense of approximately $1.9 million while a quarter of a
      percentage point reduction in the discount rate would result in approximately
      $3.8 million of additional expense. Additional information regarding the
      company’s pension plans is provided in Note 13 accompanying the
      consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report.

On
      October 26, 2005, Ball’s board of directors approved the accelerated
      vesting of the out-of-the-money, unvested nonqualified stock options granted
      in
      April 2005. The acceleration affects approximately 665,000 options
      granted to approximately 290 employees at an exercise price of $39.74. The
      accelerated vesting of these nonqualified options will allow the company to
      eliminate approximately $5 million of pretax expense (approximately
      $3 million after tax) over the next four years.

Interest
      and Taxes

Consolidated
      interest expense was $116.4 million in 2005, including debt refinancing
      costs of $19.3 million; $103.7 million in 2004 and $141.1 million
      in 2003, including debt refinancing costs of $15.2 million. The
      progressively lower expense was due to lower average borrowings and higher
      capitalized interest. The debt refinancing costs in 2005 of $19.3 million
      were costs associated with the refinancing of the company’s senior credit
      facilities and the redemption in the last half of 2005 of the company’s
      7.75% senior notes, which were due in August 2006. The debt refinancing
      costs in 2003 of $15.2 million were associated with the early redemption of
      the company’s 8.25% senior subordinated notes in August 2003.

Ball’s
      consolidated effective income tax rate for 2005 was 28.7 percent compared
      to 32 percent in 2004 and 31.3 percent in 2003. The decrease in
      the effective tax rate is primarily due to the net tax benefit recorded on
      the
      repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
      (Jobs Act), the tax benefit on business consolidation costs applied at the
      marginal tax rate, increased research and development tax credits and the
      manufacturing deduction effective in 2005 under the Jobs Act. (Further details
      of the amounts repatriated under the Jobs Act are available in Note 12
      accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this
      report.) These benefits were somewhat offset by the fact that no tax benefit
      was
      provided in respect of the equity investment write downs in the first quarter
      of
      2005. The $3.8 million write down of the aerospace investment is not tax
      deductible while the realization of tax deductibility of the $3.4 million
      PRC write down, which will be a capital loss, is not reasonably assured as
      the
      company does not have, nor does it anticipate, any capital gains to offset
      the
      capital losses.

Ball’s
      consolidated effective income tax rate for 2004 was 32 percent compared to
      31.3 percent in 2003. The overall 2004 effective rate was slightly higher,
      primarily due to higher North American earnings than in 2003, but continues
      to
      reflect a low consolidated European income tax rate due to lower profits in
      Germany, reflecting the impact of the refundable mandatory deposit on
      non-refillable containers imposed on January 1, 2003, and a tax holiday in
      Poland. Germany has the highest tax rate of the European countries in which
      Ball
      has operations.

In
      connection with the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) examination of Ball’s
      consolidated income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2003, the IRS
      has
      proposed to disallow Ball’s deductions of interest expense incurred on loans
      under a company-owned life insurance plan that has been in place for more than
      19 years. Ball believes that its interest deductions will be sustained as
      filed and, therefore, no provision for loss has been accrued. The IRS’s proposed
      adjustments would result in an increase in taxable income for the years 1999
      through 2003 of $46.7 million and a corresponding increase in taxable
      income for subsequent tax years 2004 and 2005 in the amount of
      $20.2 million with a corresponding increase in tax expense of
      $26.4 million plus any related penalties and interest expense. The
      examination reports for the 2000 to 2003 examination have been forwarded to
      the
      appeals division of the IRS, and no further action has taken place to change
      Ball’s position.

Results
      of Equity Affiliates

Equity
      in
      the earnings of affiliates in 2005 is primarily attributable to our
      50 percent ownership in packaging investments in North America and Brazil.
      Earnings in 2004 included the results of a minority-owned aerospace business,
      which was sold in October 2005, and a $15.2 million loss representing
      Ball’s share of a provision for doubtful accounts related to its 35 percent
      owned interest in Sanshui JFP (discussed above in “International Packaging”).
      After consideration of the PRC loss, earnings were $15.5 million in 2005
      compared to $15.8 million in 2004 and $11.3 million in 2003. The
      higher earnings since 2003 were primarily due to improved results in our
      packaging joint ventures in Brazil and North America.

Subsequent
      Event

On
      February 14, 2006, the company entered into a definitive merger agreement
      in which Ball will acquire U.S. Can Corporation’s (U.S. Can) U.S. and
      Argentinean operations for 1.1 million shares of Ball common stock and
      the assumption of $550 million of U.S. Can’s debt. The transaction is
      expected to close by the end of the first quarter 2006. U.S. Can is the largest
      manufacturer of aerosol cans in the U.S. and also manufactures paint cans,
      plastic containers and custom and specialty cans in 10 plants in the U.S.
      Aerosol cans are also produced in the two manufacturing plants in Argentina.
      U.S. Can’s U.S. and Argentinean operations had sales of approximately
      $600 million (unaudited) in 2005. Upon closing the acquisition of U.S. Can,
      the company intends to refinance $550 million of existing U.S. Can debt at
      significantly lower interest rates. The refinancing will be completed with
      Ball’s issuance of a new series of senior notes and an increase in bank debt
      under the new senior credit facilities put in place in the fourth quarter of
      2005.

CRITICAL
      AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING
      PRONOUNCEMENTS

For
      information regarding the company’s critical and significant policies, as well
      as recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the consolidated
      financial statements within Item 8 of this report.

FINANCIAL
      CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash
      Flows and Capital Expenditures

Cash
      flows from operating activities were $558.8 million in 2005 compared to
      $535.9 million in 2004 and $364 million in 2003. The lower amount
      generated in 2003 included $138.3 million for the payment in
      January 2003 of an accrued withholding tax obligation related to the
      acquisition of Ball Packaging Europe (further discussed below) which was funded
      by the seller at the time of closing by the inclusion of €131 million of
      additional cash.

Management
      internally uses a free cash flow measure: (1) to evaluate the company’s
      operating results, (2) for planning purposes, (3) to evaluate
      strategic investments and (4) to evaluate the company’s ability to incur and
      service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. generally accepted
      accounting principles and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash
      flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines
      free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to
      property, plant and equipment (capital spending). Free cash flow is typically
      derived directly from the company’s cash flow statements; however, it may be
      adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods. An example of
      such
      an item excluded in 2003 is the $138.3 million withholding tax payment
      liability assumed in the acquisition of Ball Packaging Europe in
      December 2002 (discussed above). We believe this is not a comparable free
      cash flow outflow of the company as it was funded by the seller.

Based
      on
      this, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows:

Cash
      flows from operating activities in 2005 were
      negatively impacted by higher cash taxes. This resulted in a decrease in the
      deferred income taxes payable of $58.5 million in 2005 compared to an
      estimated increase in deferred taxes of $42.8 million in 2004. The primary
      causes of the increase in current income taxes and decrease in deferred income
      taxes are the reduction in 2005 of tax-deductible pension costs versus 2004,
      the
      impact in 2005 of the repatriation of foreign earnings and a reduction of tax
      versus book depreciation expense as tax depreciation was accelerated in prior
      years, primarily due to bonus tax depreciation permitted in the tax laws after
      September 11, 2001. Cash flows from operating activities were positively
      affected in 2005 by lower accounts receivable, higher accounts payable and
      lower
      pension contributions.

Page
            26 of

Cash
      flow
      in 2004 compared to 2003 included higher earnings and higher accounts payable,
      offset by higher accounts receivable and inventories, as well as higher pension
      plan contributions. Inventories and accounts payable were higher due to
      increased purchases of raw materials and accounts receivable were higher
      partially as a result of strong December food can sales.

Based
      on
      information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating
      activities for 2006 to be approximately $550 million, capital spending to
      be approximately $300 million and free cash flow to be in the
      $250 million range.

Capital
      spending of $291.7 million in 2005 was above depreciation and amortization
      expense of $213.5 million as we invested capital in our best performing
      operations, including projects to increase custom can capabilities, improve
      beverage can end making productivity, convert lines from steel to aluminum
      in
      Europe and complete a new beverage can manufacturing plant in Belgrade, Serbia,
      as well as expenditures in the aerospace and technologies segment.

Debt
      Facilities and Refinancing

Interest-bearing
      debt at December 31, 2005, decreased $71 million to
      $1,589.7 million from $1,660.7 million at December 31, 2004. This
      decrease includes $358.1 million for net repurchases of common stock and
      $291.7 million of capital spending, partially offset by the effects of the
      lower euro exchange rate and operating cash flow.

On
      October 13, 2005, Ball refinanced its senior secured credit facilities. The
      new senior secured facilities extend debt maturities at lower interest rate
      spreads and provide Ball with additional borrowing capacity for future growth.
      During the third and fourth quarters of 2005, Ball redeemed its 7.75% senior
      notes due August 2006 primarily through the drawdown of funds under the new
      credit facilities. The refinancing and redemption resulted in a pretax debt
      refinancing charge of $19.3 million ($12.3 million after tax) to
      reflect the call premium associated with the senior notes and the write off
      of
      unamortized debt issuance costs.

The
      new
      senior credit facilities, which currently bear interest at variable rates and
      are due in October 2011, are comprised of the following:
      (1) ₤85 million Term A Loan; (2) €350 million Term B Loan;
      (3) C$165 million Term C Loan; (4) a multi-currency
      long-term revolving credit facility which provides the company with up to the
      equivalent of $715 million; and (5) a Canadian long-term revolving
      credit facility which provides the company with up to the equivalent of
      $35 million. At December 31, 2005, $547 million was available
      under the multi-currency revolving credit facility. The company also had
      $267 million of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at the
      end of the year, of which $106.8 million was outstanding.

During
      the first quarter of 2004, Ball repaid €31 million ($38 million) of
      its previous euro denominated Term Loan B and reduced the interest rate by
      50 basis points. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Ball repaid
      $160 million of its previous U.S. dollar denominated Term Loan B and
€25 million of its previous euro denominated Term Loan B. At the time
      of the early repayment, the interest rate on the U.S. portion of the Term
      Loan B was reduced by 50 basis points. Interest expense during the
      first quarter of 2004 and the fourth quarter of 2003 included $0.5 million
      and $2.9 million, respectively, for the write off of the unamortized
      financing costs associated with the repaid loans.

On
      August 8, 2003, Ball refinanced 8.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due in
      2008 through the private placement of $250 million of 6.875% Senior Notes
      due in 2012 issued at a price of 102% (effective yield to maturity of
      6.58 percent). In connection with the refinancing of the higher interest
      debt, in the third quarter of 2003 a pretax charge of $15.2 million was
      recorded as interest expense, which consisted of the payment of a
      $10.3 million call premium and the write off of $4.9 million of
      unamortized financing costs.

The
        company has a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing,
        revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of Ball’s North
        American packaging operations, up to $225 million as of December 31,
        2005 ($200 million as of December 31, 2004). The agreement qualifies
        as off-balance sheet financing under the provisions of Statement of Financial
        Accounting Standards No. 140.  Net funds received from the sale
        of the accounts receivable totaled $210 million and $174.7 million at
        December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and are reflected as a reduction
        of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets.

The
        company was not in default of any loan agreement at December 31, 2005, and
        has met all payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements, bank credit agreement
        and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions
        relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the
        incurrence of additional indebtedness.

Additional
      details about the company’s receivables sales agreement and debt are available
      in Notes 5 and 11, respectively, accompanying the consolidated financial
      statements within Item 8 of this report.

(a)

The
                company’s purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum,
                steel, plastic resin and other direct materials. Also included are
                commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity, aerospace
                and
                technologies contracts and other less significant items. In cases
                where
                variable prices and/or usage are involved, management’s best estimates
                have been used. Depending on the circumstances, early termination
                of the
                contracts may not result in penalties and, therefore, actual payments
                could vary significantly.

Contributions
      to the company’s defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded
      German plans, are expected to be $49 million in 2006. This estimate may
      change based on plan asset performance. Benefit payments related to these plans
      are expected to be $43 million, $46 million, $48 million,
      $51 million and $54 million for the years ending December 31, 2006
      through 2010, respectively, and $318 million thereafter. Payments to
      participants in the unfunded German plans are expected to be $22 million,
      $22 million, $23 million, $24 million and $24 million for
      the years 2006 through 2010, respectively, and a total of $131 million
      thereafter.

We
      increased our share repurchase program in 2005 to $358.1 million, net of
      issuances, compared to $50 million net repurchases in 2004. On
      January 31, 2005, in a privately negotiated stock repurchase transaction,
      Ball entered into a forward purchase agreement to repurchase 3 million of
      its common shares at an initial price of $42.72 per share using cash on hand
      and
      available borrowings. The price per share was subject to a price adjustment
      based on a weighted average price calculation for the period between the initial
      purchase date and the settlement date. The company completed its purchase of
      the
      3 million shares at an average price of $41.63 per share and obtained
      delivery of the shares in early May 2005.

On
      October 26, 2005, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to
      12 million shares of Ball common stock. This most recent repurchase
      authorization replaced the previous authorization of up to 12 million
      shares approved in July 2004, under which approximately 1 million
      shares remained at October 26, 2005.

Annual
      cash dividends paid on common stock were
      40 cents per share in 2005, 35 cents per share in 2004 and
      24 cents per share in 2003. Total dividends paid were $42.5 million in
      2005, $38.9 million in 2004 and $26.8 million in 2003.

Contingencies

The
      company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course
      of
      business due, in part, to the competitive nature of the industries in which
      we
      participate, our operations in developing markets outside the U.S., changing
      commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our products
      and
      changing capital markets. Where practicable, we attempt to reduce these risks
      and uncertainties through the establishment of risk management policies and
      procedures, including, at times, the use of derivative financial instruments
      as
      explained in Item 7A of this report.

From
      time
      to time, the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its business.
      Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated Ball
      as a
      potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the
      cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Our information at this time does
      not
      indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the
      liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the
      company.

Due
      to
      political and legal uncertainties in Germany, no nationwide system for returning
      beverage containers was in place at the time a mandatory deposit was imposed
      in
      January 2003 and nearly all retailers stopped carrying beverages in
      non-refillable containers. During 2003 and 2004, we responded to the resulting
      lower demand for beverage cans by reducing production at our German plants,
      implementing aggressive cost reduction measures and increasing exports from
      Germany to other countries in the region served by Ball Packaging Europe. We
      also closed a plant in the United Kingdom, shut down a production line in
      Germany, delayed capital investment projects in France and Poland and converted
      one of our steel can production lines in Germany to aluminum in order to
      facilitate additional can exports from Germany.  In 2004 the German
      parliament adopted a new packaging ordinance, imposing a 25 eurocent deposit
      on
      all one-way glass, PET and metal containers for water, beer and carbonated
      soft
      drinks. As of May 1, 2006, all retailers must redeem all returned one-way
      containers as long as they sell such containers. Major retailers in Germany
      have
      begun the process of implementing a returnable system for one-way containers
      since they, along with fillers, now appear to accept the deposit as permanent.
       The retailers and the filling and packaging industries have formed a
      committee to design a nationwide recollection system and several retailers
      have
      begun to order reverse vending machines in order to meet the May 1, 2006,
      deadline.

The
      preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
      accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
      that
      affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
      contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
      of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future events could affect
      these estimates. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements
      (within Item 8 of this report) for a summary of the company’s critical and
      significant accounting policies.

The
      U.S.
      and European economies and the company have experienced minor general inflation
      during the past several years. Management believes that evaluation of Ball’s
      performance during the periods covered by these consolidated financial
      statements should be based upon historical financial
      statements.

      and market risks such as the devaluation or revaluation of certain currencies
      and the activities of foreign subsidiaries; international business risks
      (including foreign exchange rates and activities of foreign subsidiaries) in
      Europe and particularly in developing countries such as the PRC and Brazil;
      changes in the foreign exchange rates of the U.S. dollar against the European
      euro, British pound, Polish zloty, Serbian dinar, Hong Kong dollar, Canadian
      dollar, Chinese renminbi and Brazilian real, and in the foreign exchange rate
      of
      the European euro against the British pound, Polish zloty and Serbian dinar;
      terrorist activity or war that disrupts the company’s production or supply;
      regulatory action or laws including tax, environmental and workplace safety;
      technological developments and innovations; successful or unsuccessful
      acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures and the integration activities
      associated therewith; changes to unaudited results due to statutory audits
      of
      our financial statements or management’s evaluation of the company’s internal
      controls over financial reporting; and loss contingencies related to income
      and
      other tax matters, including those arising from audits performed by U.S. and
      foreign tax authorities. If the company is unable to achieve its goals, then
      the
      company’s actual performance could vary materially from those goals expressed or
      implied in the forward-looking statements. The company currently does not intend
      to publicly update forward-looking statements except as it deems necessary
      in
      quarterly or annual earnings reports. You are advised, however, to consult
      any
      further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K
      reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
                Risk

Financial
      Instruments and Risk Management

In
      the
      ordinary course of business, we employ established risk management policies
      and
      procedures to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest
      rates, foreign currencies and prices of the company’s common stock in regard to
      common share repurchases. Although the instruments utilized involve varying
      degrees of credit, market and interest risk, the counterparties to the
      agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the
      agreements.

We
      have
      estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Market risk
      exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative
      instruments, financial instruments and commodity positions. To test the
      sensitivity of our market risk exposure, we have estimated the changes in fair
      value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical
      10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates. The results of the
      sensitivity analysis are summarized below.

Commodity
      Price Risk

We
      manage
      our commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of
      aluminum primarily by entering into container sales contracts, which generally
      include aluminum-based pricing terms that consider price fluctuations under
      our
      commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases. Such terms generally include
      a fixed price or an upper limit to the aluminum component pricing. This matched
      pricing affects most of our North American metal beverage container net sales.
      We also, at times, use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward
      contracts as cash flow and fair value hedges of commodity price risk where
      there
      is not a pass-through arrangement in the sales contract.

Our
      North
      American plastic container sales contracts include provisions to pass through
      resin cost changes. As a result, we believe we have minimal, if any, exposure
      related to changes in the cost of plastic resin. Most North American food
      container sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass
      through some or all steel cost changes we incur or incorporate annually
      negotiated steel costs. In 2005 and 2004 we were able to pass through the
      majority of steel surcharges to our customers.

In
      Europe
      and Asia the company manages aluminum and steel raw material commodity price
      risks through annual and long-term contracts for the purchase of the materials,
      as well as certain sales of containers, that reduce the company's exposure
      to
      fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year. These purchase and
      sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass-through pricing
      arrangements. The company also uses forward and option contracts as cash flow
      hedges to minimize the company’s exposure to significant price changes for those
      sales contracts where there is not a pass-through arrangement.

Considering
      the effects of derivative instruments, the market’s ability to accept price
      increases and the company’s commodity price exposures, a hypothetical
      10 percent adverse change in the company’s metal prices could result in an
      estimated $5.2 million after-tax reduction of net earnings over a one-year
      period. Additionally, if foreign currency exchange rates were to change
      adversely by 10 percent, we estimate there could be an $11.7 million
      after-tax reduction of net earnings over a one-year period for foreign currency
      exposures on the metal. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in
      market prices and rates. Sensitivity to foreign currency exposures related
      to
      metal increased over prior years due to an increase in metal purchases and
      related payables at our foreign operations, which are subject to foreign
      currency fluctuations.

The
      company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for utilities such as natural
      gas and electricity. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in our utility
      prices could result in an estimated $7.3 million after-tax reduction of net
      earnings over a one-year period. Actual results may vary based on actual changes
      in market prices and rates.

Page
          31 of

Interest
      Rate Risk

Our
      objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact
      of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall
      borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we use a variety of interest
      rate
      swaps and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed-rate debt. Interest
      rate instruments held by the company at December 31, 2005 and 2004, included
      pay-fixed and pay-floating interest rate swaps. Pay-fixed swaps effectively
      convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments. The majority of
      the
      pay-floating swaps, which effectively convert fixed-rate obligations to variable
      rate instruments, are fair value hedges.

Based
      on
      our interest rate exposure at December 31, 2005, assumed floating rate debt
      levels throughout 2006 and the effects of derivative instruments, a 100 basis
      point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated $5.2 million
      after-tax reduction of net earnings over a one-year period. Actual results
      may
      vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these
      changes.

Foreign
      Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Our
      objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect
      foreign cash flows and earnings associated with foreign exchange rate changes
      through the use of cash flow hedges. In addition, we manage foreign earnings
      translation volatility through the use of foreign currency options. Our foreign
      currency translation risk results from the European euro, British pound,
      Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real and Serbian
      dinar. We face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of
      purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars and, to a lesser extent, in other
      currencies. Sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost
      changes and, where there is not a foreign exchange pass-through arrangement,
      the
      company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency
      exposures.

Considering
      the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31,
      2005, and the currency exposures, a hypothetical 10 percent reduction in
      foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar could result in
      an
      estimated $19.4 million after-tax reduction of net earnings over a one-year
      period. This amount includes the $11.7 million currency exposure discussed
      above in the “Commodity Price Risk” section. This hypothetical adverse change in
      foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt
      balance by $63 million. Actual changes in market prices or rates may differ
      from hypothetical changes. Sensitivity to foreign currency exposures related
      to
      metal increased over prior years due to an increase in metal purchases and
      related payables at our foreign operations, which are subject to foreign
      currency fluctuations.

Financial
                Statements and Supplementary
                Data

Report
      of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To

the
      Board
      of Directors and Shareholders of Ball Corporation:

We
      have
      completed integrated audits of Ball Corporation’s 2005 and 2004
      consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
      reporting as of December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated
      financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits,
      are presented below.

Consolidated
      financial statements

In
      our
      opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index
      appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the
      financial position of Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31,
      and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
      of
      the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005

in
      conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
      of
      America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
      management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
      statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements
      in
      accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
      (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
      to
      obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
      of
      material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining,
      on a
      test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
      made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
      We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
      opinion.

Internal
      control over financial reporting

Also,
      in
      our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management's Report on
      Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing in Item 9A, that the Company
      maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December
      31, 2005 based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control

–

Integrated
      Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
      is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
      Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
      effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
      based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control

–

Integrated Framework

issued
      by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
      internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
      effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
      is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness
      of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
      We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in
      accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
      (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
      to
      obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
      financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of
      internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding
      of
      internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
      testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
      control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
      circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
      opinions.

          33 of

A
      company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
      to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
      (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
      necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
      generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
      of
      the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
      and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
      regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
      or
      disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
      financial statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1.
      Critical and Significant Accounting Policies

In
      the
      application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
      of
      America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect
      the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingencies
      and
      reported amounts of revenues and expenses. These estimates are based on
      historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable
      under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under
      different assumptions or conditions.

Critical
      Accounting Policies

The
      company considers certain accounting policies to be critical, as their
      application requires management’s best judgment in making estimates about the
      effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Following is a discussion
      of
      the accounting policies we consider critical to our consolidated financial
      statements.

Revenue
      Recognition in the Aerospace and Technologies Segment

Sales
      under long-term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment are
      recognized under the cost-to-cost, percentage-of-completion method. This
      business segment sells using two types of long-term sales contracts

–

cost-plus
      sales
      contracts, which represent approximately two-thirds of sales, and fixed
      price sales contracts which account for the remainder. A cost-plus sales
      contract is an agreement to perform the contract for cost plus an agreed upon
      profit component, whereas fixed price sales contracts are completed for a fixed
      price or involve the sale of engineering labor at fixed rates per hour.
      Cost-plus sales contracts can have different types of fee arrangements,
      including fixed fee, cost, schedule and performance incentive fees, award fees
      or a combination thereof.

During
      initial periods of sales contract performance, our estimates of base, incentive
      and other fees are established at a conservative estimate of profit over the
      period of contract performance. Throughout the period of contract performance,
      we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of total
      contract revenue, total contract cost and extent of progress toward completion.
      Provision for estimated contract losses, if any, is made in the period that
      such
      losses are determined to be probable. Because of sales contract payment
      schedules, limitations on funding and contract terms, our sales and accounts
      receivable generally include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.
      As a prime U.S. government contractor or subcontractor, the aerospace and
      technologies segment is subject to a high degree of regulation, financial review
      and oversight by the U.S. government.

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets

We
      evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually, and we evaluate our other
      intangible assets whenever there is evidence that certain events or changes
      in
      circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be
      recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a fair value approach,
      using discounted cash flows to establish fair values. We recognize an impairment
      charge for any amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its
      fair
      value. When available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples
      to
      corroborate discounted cash flow results. When a business within a reporting
      unit is disposed of, goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition
      using the relative fair value methodology.

We
      amortize the cost of other intangibles over their estimated useful lives unless
      such lives are deemed indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are tested
      for
      impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down
      to
      fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. Intangible
      assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment and written
      down
      to fair value as required.

      Critical and Significant Accounting Policies

(continued)

Defined
      Benefit Pension Plans and Other Employee Benefits

The
      company has defined benefit plans that cover the majority of its employees,
      including those at Ball Packaging Europe. We also have postretirement plans
      that
      provide medical benefits and life insurance for retirees and eligible
      dependents. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided
      in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, "Employers’
Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
      Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." Both of these statements require
      that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of
      return on plan assets, discount rates used to measure future obligations and
      expenses, salary scale inflation rates, health care cost trend rates and other
      assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension
      and
      postretirement plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly
      susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan
      assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions and contracted benefit changes.
      The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic
      and market conditions at the time of valuation. However, actual results may
      differ substantially from these assumptions.

Pension
      plan liabilities are revalued annually based on updated assumptions and
      information about the individuals covered by the plan. For pension plans,
      accumulated gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor, the prior
      service cost and the transition asset are amortized on a straight-line basis
      from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active
      participants. For other postemployment benefits, the 10 percent corridor is
      not used.

In
      addition to defined benefit and postretirement plans, the company maintains
      reserves for employee medical claims, up to our insurance stop-loss limit,
      and
      workers’ compensation claims. These are regularly evaluated and revised, as
      needed, based on a variety of information including historical experience,
      third
      party actuarial estimates and current employee statistics.

Taxes
      on Income

Deferred
      tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carry
      forwards, are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
      management, it is more likely than not that any portion of these tax attributes
      will not be realized. In addition, from time to time, management must assess
      the
      need to accrue or disclose a possible loss contingency for proposed adjustments
      from various federal, state and foreign tax authorities that regularly audit
      the
      company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments,
      management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions,
      including many foreign jurisdictions.

Deferred
      income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the
      tax
      bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each
      balance sheet date, based upon enacted income tax laws and tax rates. Income
      tax
      expense or benefit is provided based on earnings reported in the financial
      statements. The provision for income tax expense or benefit differs from the
      amounts of income taxes currently payable because certain items of income and
      expense included in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in
      different time periods by taxing authorities.

Business
      Consolidation Costs

The
      company estimates its liabilities for business consolidation activities by
      accumulating detailed estimates of costs and asset sales proceeds, if any,
      for
      each business consolidation initiative. This includes the estimated costs of
      employee severance, pension and related benefits, impairment of property and
      equipment and other assets, including estimates of realizable value, contract
      termination payments for leases, contractual obligations and any other
      qualifying costs related to the exit plan. These estimated costs are grouped
      by
      specific projects within the overall exit plan and are then monitored on a
      monthly basis. Such disclosures represent management's best estimates, but
      require assumptions about the plans that may change over time. Changes in
      estimates for individual locations are evaluated periodically to determine
      if a
      change in estimate is required for the overall restructuring plan. Subsequent
      changes to the original estimates are included in current period earnings and
      identified as business consolidation gains or losses.

Significant
      Accounting Policies

Principles
      of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The
      consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ball Corporation
      and
      its controlled subsidiaries (collectively, Ball, the company, we or our). Equity
      investments in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control
      and
      are not the primary beneficiary, are accounted for using the equity method
      of
      accounting. Investments in which we do not exercise significant influence over
      the investee are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Intercompany
      transactions are eliminated.

Cash
      Equivalents

Cash
      equivalents have original maturities of three months or less.

Inventories

Inventories
      are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of the aluminum component
      of
      U.S. metal beverage container inventories and substantially all inventories
      within the U.S. metal food container business are determined using the
      last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting. The cost of remaining
      inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) average cost
      method of accounting.

Depreciation
      and Amortization

Property,
      plant and equipment are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction
      and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation
      and
      amortization are provided using the straight-line method in amounts sufficient
      to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives (buildings
      and improvements - 15 to 40 years; machinery and equipment - 5 to
      15 years; other intangible assets - 7.3 years, weighted
      average).

Deferred
      financing costs are amortized over the life of the related loan facility and
      are
      reported as part of interest expense. When debt is repaid prior to its maturity
      date, the write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs is
      also reported as interest expense.

(continued)

Environmental
      Reserves

We
      estimate the liability related to environmental matters based on, among other
      factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability
      to
      make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. We record our best estimate
      of
      a loss when the loss is considered probable. As additional information becomes
      available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending matters
      and
      revise our estimates.

Revenue
      Recognition in the Packaging Segments

Sales
      of
      products in the packaging segments are recognized when delivery has occurred
      and
      title has transferred, there is persuasive evidence of an agreement or
      arrangement, the price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably
      assured.

Stock-Based
      Compensation

Ball
      has
      a variety of restricted stock and stock option plans. With the exception of
      the
      company’s deposit share program, which through 2005 has been accounted for as a
      variable plan and is discussed in Note 14, the compensation cost associated
      with
      restricted stock grants has been calculated using the fair value at the date
      of
      grant and amortized over the restriction period. Expense related to stock
      options has been calculated using the intrinsic value method under the
      guidelines of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, and has
      therefore not been included in the consolidated statements of earnings. Ball’s
      earnings as reported include after-tax stock-based compensation of
      $6.6 million, $12.5 million and $7.6 million for the years ended
      December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. If the fair value based
      method had been used, after-tax stock-based compensation would have been
      $8.7 million in 2005, $9.3 million in 2004 and $8.8 million in
      2003, and diluted earnings per share would have been lower by $0.02 in 2005,
      higher by $0.03 in 2004 and lower by $0.01 in 2003. Further details regarding
      the expense calculated under the fair value based method are provided in
      Note 14. Effective January 1, 2006, the company adopted
      SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (see the discussion
      of this new standard in the “New Accounting Pronouncements”
section).

Foreign
      Currency Translation

Assets
      and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using period-end exchange
      rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates
      during each period. Translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated
      other comprehensive earnings as a component of shareholders’
equity.

Derivative
      Financial Instruments

The
      company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging
      exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
      product sales, raw materials purchasing and common share repurchases. The
      company’s derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets
      at fair value. For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge of a recognized
      asset or liability, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period
      of
      change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable
      to the risk being hedged. For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge,
      or a
      derivative designated as a fair value hedge of a firm commitment not yet
      recorded on the balance sheet, the effective portion of the derivative's gain
      or
      loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
      earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted
      transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss
      associated with all hedges is reported in earnings immediately.

      Critical and Significant Accounting Policies

(continued)

Realized
      gains and losses from hedges are classified in the income statement consistent
      with the accounting treatment of the item being hedged. Gains and losses upon
      the early termination of effective derivative contracts are deferred in
      accumulated other comprehensive earnings and amortized to earnings in the same
      period as the originally hedged items affect earnings.

Reclassifications

Certain
      prior year amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to the current
      year presentation.

New
      Accounting Pronouncements

In
      May 2005 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS
      No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections - a Replacement of APB
      Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3.” The new standard
      changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in
      accounting principle and applies to all such voluntary changes. The previous
      accounting required that most changes in accounting principle be recognized
      in
      net earnings by including a cumulative effect of the change in the period of
      the
      change. SFAS No. 154, which will be effective for Ball beginning
      January 1, 2006, requires retroactive application to prior periods’
financial statements.

In
      December 2004 the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),
“Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) is a revision
      of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and
      supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”
The new standard, which will be effective for Ball beginning January 1,
      2006, establishes accounting standards for transactions in which an entity
      exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, including stock option
      and restricted stock grants. On March 29, 2005, the Securities and Exchange
      Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, which
      summarizes the views of the SEC staff regarding the interaction between SFAS
      No.
      123 (revised 2004) and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides the SEC
      staff’s views regarding the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for
      public companies. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Ball
      anticipates using the modified prospective transition method and, at least
      initially, the Black-Scholes valuation model. The incremental expense associated
      with the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) for unvested stock
      option and deposit share program restricted stock grants existing at
      December 31, 2005, is expected to be insignificant. Actual 2006 expense
      will vary based on additional grants made during 2006.

In
      November 2004 the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs - an
      amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.” SFAS No. 151 requires abnormal
      amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material
      (spoilage) to be recognized as current-period charges. It also requires that
      the
      allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based
      on
      the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be
      effective for inventory costs incurred by Ball beginning on January 1,
      2006. Ball believes that the potential future impact, if any, of
      SFAS No. 151 will not be significant to its consolidated financial
      statements.

      Business Segment Information

The
      company has determined that it has five reportable segments organized
      along a combination of product lines and geographic areas - North
      American metal beverage packaging, North American metal food packaging, North

      We
      also have investments in the packaging segments that are accounted for under
      the
      equity method of accounting, and, accordingly, those results are not included
      in
      segment sales or earnings. The accounting policies of the segments are the
      same
      as those described in the summary of critical and significant accounting
      policies (Note 1). See also Notes 3 and 4 for information regarding
      transactions affecting segment results.

      Acquisitions

Ball
      Western Can Company (Ball Western Can)

On
      March 17, 2004, Ball acquired ConAgra Grocery Products Company’s (ConAgra)
      interest in Ball Western Can for $30 million. Ball Western Can, located in
      Oakdale, California, was established in 2000 as a 50/50 joint venture between
      Ball and ConAgra and, prior to the acquisition, was accounted for by Ball using
      the equity method of accounting. The acquisition has been accounted for as
      a
      purchase, and accordingly, its results have been consolidated in our financial
      statements from the acquisition date. Contemporaneous with the acquisition,
      Ball
      and ConAgra’s parent company, ConAgra Foods Inc., entered into a long-term
      agreement under which Ball provides metal food containers to ConAgra
      manufacturing locations in California. The acquisition of Ball Western Can
      was
      not significant to the company.

Metal
      Packaging International (MPI)

On
      March 11, 2003, Ball acquired MPI, a manufacturer of ends for aluminum
      beverage cans, for $28 million. MPI produced just over 2 billion ends
      per year, primarily for carbonated soft drink companies, and had sales of
      $42 million in 2002. The MPI plant was closed during the second quarter of
      2003 and sold in October 2004, with its manufacturing volumes being
      consolidated into other Ball facilities. The acquisition of MPI was not
      significant to the company.

North
      American Metal Beverage Packaging

The
      company announced in July 2005 the commencement of a project to upgrade and
      streamline its North American beverage can end manufacturing capabilities.
      The
      project is expected to be completed in 2007 and will result in productivity
      gains and cost reductions. A pretax charge of $19.3 million
      ($11.7 million after tax) was recorded in the third quarter of 2005 in
      connection with this project. The pretax charge includes $11.7 million for
      employee severance, pension and other employee benefit costs, $1.6 million
      for decommissioning costs and $6 million for the write off of obsolete
      equipment spare parts and tooling. Payments made in 2005 were
      insignificant.

North
      American Metal Food Packaging

The
      fourth quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge of $4.6 million
      ($3.1 million after tax) for pension, severance and other employee benefit
      costs related to a reduction in force in our Burlington, Ontario, plant.
      Payments made in 2005 were insignificant.

A
      pretax
      charge of $8.8 million ($5.9 million after tax) was recorded in the
      second quarter of 2005 in connection with the closure of a three-piece food
      can
      manufacturing plant in Quebec, Canada. The Quebec plant was closed and ceased
      operations in the third quarter of 2005 and an agreement has been reached to
      sell the land and building which resulted in the second quarter charge being
      offset by a $2.2 million gain ($1.5 million after tax) in the fourth
      quarter to adjust the Quebec plant to net realizable value. At December 31,
      2005, the resulting reserve had been reduced by $1.9 million of cash
      payments made. The pretax charge, net of the offsetting gain, included
      $3.2 million for employee severance, pension and other employee benefit
      costs and $3.4 million for decommissioning cost and the write-down to net
      realizable value of fixed assets and other costs. When all assets are disposed
      of, management expects the plant closure to result in a net cash inflow. A
      total
      of 77 employees were terminated in connection with the
      closure.

The

      the 2005 North American business consolidation activities was $5.3 million
      at December 31, 2005.

International
      Packaging

The
      company recorded $9.3 million of earnings in 2005, primarily related to the
      final settlement of tax obligations, and an adjustment to reclassify an asset
      to
      be put in service previously held for sale, related to a $237.7 million business
      consolidation charge taken in the second quarter of 2001. Tax clearances from
      the applicable authorities were required during the formal liquidation process.
      These matters have been concluded.


North
      American Metal Food Packaging

In
      the
      fourth quarter of 2004, a gain of $0.4 million was recorded, as costs were
      less than estimated for the 2003 closure of a metal food container plant.

North
      American Plastic Packaging

In
      the
      third quarter, earnings of $0.7 million were recorded as costs related to the
      shut down and relocation of the Atlanta plastics offices and research and
      development (R&D) facility were less than expected. The office relocation
      was completed during 2003 and the R&D facility relocation was completed in
      2004.

International
      Packaging

The
      company recorded $13.7 million of earnings in 2004, primarily related to
      the realization of assets in the PRC in excess of amounts previously estimated,
      and costs of consolidation and liquidation less than anticipated, related to
      a
      $237.7 million business consolidation charge taken in the second quarter of
      2001.

Aerospace
      and Technologies

Earnings
      of $0.4 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 for exit costs
      that
      were no longer required due to the sale of a product line whose operations
      ceased in 2001.

      Business Consolidation Activities

(continued)


North
      American Metal Beverage

A
      gain of
      $1.6 million was recorded in the fourth quarter in connection with the sale,
      and
      the completion of the consolidation activities, related to a metal beverage
      container plant closed in December 2001.

North
      American Metal Food

In
      the
      first quarter Ball announced plans to close a metal food container plant to
      address decreased demand for three-piece welded cans. In connection with the
      closure, a charge of $1.9 million was recorded, partially offset by a
      $0.5 million gain on the sale of a Canadian plant that was included in a
      business consolidation charge taken in 2000. The $1.9 million charge
      included $0.8 million for employee severance and benefit costs and
      $1.1 million for decommissioning costs and an impairment charge on fixed
      assets.

International
      Packaging

Ball
      Packaging Europe closed its plant in Runcorn, England, at the end of December
      2003. The cost of the plant closure, along with costs associated with a line
      conversion and a line shut down at other plants, estimated to be
€11.9 million in total, was accounted for in the opening acquisition
      balance sheet. These costs included €8.7 million for employee termination
      costs and €3.2 million for decommissioning costs, of which €10.5 million
      was paid and €0.6 million was reversed to goodwill as costs were less than
      initially estimated. The remaining balance of €0.8 million is for early
      retirement benefits to be paid under local law in future periods. There are
      no
      remaining assets held for sale at December 31, 2005.

The
      company recorded $3.3 million of earnings in 2003, primarily related to the
      realization of assets in the PRC in excess of amounts previously estimated,
      and
      costs of consolidation and liquidation less than anticipated, related to a
      $237.7 million business consolidation charge taken in the second quarter of
      2001.

Aerospace
      and Technologies

Earnings
      of $0.2 million in the third quarter of 2003 for exit costs that were no
      longer required due to the sale of a product line whose operations ceased in
      2001.

5.
      Accounts Receivable

Accounts
      receivable are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $13.4 million
      at December 31, 2005, and $17.1 million at December 31,
      2004.

A
      receivables sales agreement provides for the ongoing, revolving sale of a
      designated pool of trade accounts receivable of Ball’s North American packaging
      operations of up to $225 million (increased during the third quarter of
      2005 from the previous limit of $200 million). The agreement qualifies as
      off-balance sheet financing under the provisions of SFAS No. 140. Net
      funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled
      $210 million and $174.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively, and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the
      consolidated balance sheets. Fees incurred in connection with the sale of
      accounts receivable, which are reported as part of selling, general and
      administrative expenses, totaled $7.7 million in 2005, $3.2 million in
      2004 and $2.5 million in 2003.

      Accounts Receivable

(continued)

Net
      accounts receivable under long-term contracts, due primarily from agencies
      of
      the U.S. government and their prime contractors, were $121.7 million and
      $85.8 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and
      included $70.8 million and $60.6 million, respectively, representing
      the recognized sales value of performance that had not been billed and were
      not
      yet billable to customers. The average length of the long-term contracts is
      three years and the average length remaining on those contracts at
      December 31, 2005, was 12 months. Approximately $3 million of
      unbilled receivables at December 31, 2005, is expected to be collected
      after one year and is related to customary fees and cost withholdings that
      will
      be paid upon milestone or contract completions, as well as final overhead rate
      settlements.

      property, plant and equipment balance during 2005 is the result of capital
      spending offset by depreciation and changes in foreign currency exchange
      rates.

During
      2003 the company entered into capital leases totaling $6.7 million. The
      acquisitions of equipment under these capital leases were noncash transactions
      and, accordingly, have been excluded from the consolidated statement of cash
      flows.

      decrease in goodwill due to purchase accounting adjustments primarily relates
      to
      the reduction of the remaining goodwill associated with the deferred taxes
      on
      foreign earnings that decreased as a result of the repatriation of the foreign

      currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2005, total annual intangible asset
      amortization expense is expected to be between $9.7 million and
      $11.1 million in each of the years 2006 through 2009 and $1.1 million
      in 2010.

In
      the
      first quarter of 2005, selling, general and administrative expenses included
      $3.8 million for the write down to net realizable value of an equity
      investment in an aerospace company. The remaining carrying amount of
      $14 million was reclassified to other current assets and was sold in
      October 2005 for $7 million cash and a $7.2 million
      interest-bearing note due April 2007. Also included in the first quarter of
      2005 was an expense of $3.4 million for the full write off of a PRC equity
      investment in a joint venture. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the company
      recorded a $15.2 million equity earnings loss from the same joint venture
      related to a bad debt provision. Information learned late in the first quarter
      of 2005 led the company to conclude that it does not expect to recover the
      remaining carrying value of this investment.

      Leases

The
      company leases warehousing and manufacturing space and certain equipment,
      primarily within the packaging segments, and office and technical space,
      primarily within the aerospace and technologies segment. During 2005 and 2003
      we
      entered into leases which qualify as operating leases for book purposes and
      capital leases for tax purposes. Under these lease arrangements, Ball has the
      option to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease term, or if
      we
      elect not to do so, to compensate the lessors for the difference between the
      guaranteed minimum residual values totaling $16.3 million and the fair
      market value of the assets, if less. Certain of the company’s leases in effect
      at December 31, 2005, include renewal options and/or escalation clauses for
      adjusting lease expense based on various factors.

Total
      noncancellable operating leases in effect at December 31, 2005, require rental
      payments of $45.8 million, $35.3 million, $25.3 million,
      $19.4 million and $15.4 million for the years 2006 through 2010,
      respectively, and $56.8 million combined for all years thereafter. Lease
      expense for all operating leases was $74 million, $71.3 million and
      $64.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

11. 
      Debt and Interest Costs

(continued)


On
      October 13, 2005, Ball refinanced its senior secured credit
      facilities. The new senior secured credit facilities extend debt maturities
      at
      lower interest rate spreads and provide Ball with additional borrowing capacity
      for future growth. During the third and fourth quarters of 2005, Ball redeemed
      its 7.75% senior notes due in August 2006. The refinancing and senior note
      redemptions resulted in a debt refinancing charge of $19.3 million
      ($12.3 million after tax) for the related call premium and unamortized debt
      issuance costs.

The
      new
      senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and also include
      (1) a multi-currency, long-term revolving credit facility which provides
      the company with up to the equivalent of $715 million and (2) a
      Canadian long-term revolving credit facility which provides the company with
      up
      to the equivalent of $35 million. Both revolving credit facilities expire
      in October 2011. At December 31, 2005, taking into account outstanding
      letters of credit, $547 million was available under the revolving credit
      facilities.

Maturities
      of all long-term debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2005, are
      $9.5 million, $32.2 million, $75.3 million, $85.2 million
      and $205.7 million for the years ending December 31, 2006 through 2010,
      respectively, and $1,071.2 million thereafter. Ball provides letters of
      credit in the ordinary course of business to secure liabilities recorded in
      connection with industrial development revenue bonds and certain self-insurance
      arrangements. Letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      were
      $34 million and $43 million, respectively.

The
      notes
      payable and senior credit facilities are guaranteed on a full, unconditional
      and
      joint and several basis by certain of the company’s domestic wholly owned
      subsidiaries. Certain foreign denominated tranches of the senior credit
      facilities are similarly guaranteed by certain of the company’s wholly owned
      foreign subsidiaries. Note 19 contains further details as well as
      condensed, consolidating financial information for the company, segregating
      the
      guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries.

The
      company was not in default of any loan agreement at December 31, 2005, and
      has
      met all debt payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements, bank credit
      agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain
      restrictions relating to dividend payments, share repurchases, investments,
      financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness.


During
      the first quarter of 2004, Ball repaid €31 million ($38 million) of
      its previous euro denominated Term Loan B and reduced the interest rate by
      50 basis points. Interest expense during the first quarter of 2004 included
      $0.5 million for the write off of the unamortized financing costs
      associated with the repaid loans.


On
      August 8, 2003, Ball refinanced 8.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due in
      2008 through the placement of $250 million of 6.875% Senior Notes due in
      2012 issued at a price of 102% (effective yield to maturity of
      6.58 percent). In connection with the refinancing of the higher interest
      debt, in the third quarter of 2003 a pretax charge of $15.2 million was
      recorded as interest expense, which consisted of the payment of a
      $10.3 million call premium and the write off of $4.9 million of
      unamortized financing costs. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Ball repaid
      $160 million of its previous U.S. dollar denominated Term Loan B and
€25 million of the euro denominated Term Loan B. At the time of the
      early repayment, the interest rate on the U.S. portion of the Term Loan B
      was reduced by 50 basis points. Interest expense during the fourth quarter
      of 2003 included $2.9 million for the write off of the unamortized
      financing costs associated with the repaid loans.

In
      Ball Packaging Europe’s Polish subsidiary was granted a tax holiday. Under the
      terms of the holiday, an exemption was granted on manufacturing earnings for
      up
      to €39.5 million of income tax. At December 31, 2005, the remaining
      tax holiday available to reduce future Polish tax liability was
€5.5 million. In 2005 Ball Packaging Europe’s Serbian subsidiary was
      granted a tax holiday. Under the terms of the holiday, the earnings of this
      subsidiary will be exempt from income taxation for a period of 10 years
      beginning with the first year the Serbian subsidiary has taxable earnings.

Net
      income tax payments were $99 million, $72.6 million and
      $28.4 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The
      change in deferred taxes during 2005 is primarily attributable to book
      depreciation exceeding tax depreciation, a reduction in cash pension payments
      and the effects of foreign currency exchange rates.

At
      December 31, 2005, Ball Packaging Europe and subsidiaries had net operating
      loss carryforwards, with no expiration date, of $52 million with a related
      tax benefit of $14.8 million. Due to the uncertainty of ultimate
      realization, that benefit has been offset by a valuation allowance of
      $4.8 million. Any realization of the valuation allowance will be recognized
      as a reduction in goodwill. At December 31, 2005, the company has foreign
      tax credit carryforwards in the amount of $5.8 million; however, due to the
      uncertainty of realization of the entire credit, a valuation allowance of
      $3.8 million has been applied to reduce the carrying value to $2
      million.

On
      October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act) was
      signed into law. The Jobs Act provides certain domestic companies a temporary
      opportunity to repatriate previously undistributed earnings of controlled
      foreign subsidiaries at a reduced federal tax rate, approximating
      5.25 percent. The reduced rate is achieved via an 85 percent dividends
      received deduction on earnings repatriated during a one-year period on or before
      December 31, 2005. To qualify for the deduction, the repatriated earnings must
      be reinvested in the United States pursuant to one or more domestic reinvestment
      plans approved, in advance of distribution, by the company's chief executive
      officer (CEO) and subsequently approved by the company's board of directors.
      Certain other criteria in the Jobs Act were satisfied as well.

12. 
      Taxes on Income

(continued)

In
      July
      2005 the company’s CEO approved a foreign dividend and capital distribution plan
      that included the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain of its
      foreign subsidiaries during the third and fourth quarters of 2005. The
      applicable domestic reinvestment plans were approved by the CEO, in advance
      of
      distributions, and subsequently approved by the board of directors as required
      under the Jobs Act. Under the plan, the distribution was $488.4 million, of
      which approximately $320.3 million is taxable and subject to the provisions
      of
      the Jobs Act. The company recorded a current tax payable of $16 million that
      was
      more than offset by the release of $19.2 million of accrued taxes on prior
      year
      unremitted foreign earnings, resulting in a net decrease in tax expense of
      $3.2
      million.

Notwithstanding
      the 2005 distribution pursuant to the Jobs Act, management’s intention is to
      indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings. Subsequent to the aforementioned Jobs
      Act distribution, substantially all of the previously undistributed earnings
      of
      Ball’s controlled foreign corporations have been distributed; therefore, no
      deferred tax provision would be required at December 31, 2005.

As
      previously reported in the company’s 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, in
      connection with the Internal Revenue Service’s examination of Ball’s
      consolidated income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2003, the IRS
      has
      proposed to disallow Ball’s deductions of interest expense incurred on loans
      under a company-owned life insurance plan that has been in place for more than
      19 years. Ball believes that its interest deductions will be sustained as
      filed and, therefore, no provision for loss has been accrued. The IRS’s proposed
      adjustments would result in an increase in taxable income for the years 1999
      through 2003 of $46.7 million and a corresponding increase in taxable
      income for subsequent tax years 2004 and 2005 in the amount of
      $20.2 million with a corresponding increase in aggregate tax expense of
      $26.4 million plus any related interest expense and penalties. The
      examination reports for the 2000 to 2003 examinations have been forwarded to
      the
      appeals division of the IRS, and no further action has taken place to change
      Ball’s position.

The
      company's pension plans cover substantially all U.S., Canadian and European
      employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. The defined benefit plans
      for salaried employees, as well as those for hourly employees in Germany and
      the
      United Kingdom, provide pension benefits based on employee compensation and
      years of service. Plans for North American hourly employees provide benefits
      based on fixed rates for each year of service. The German plans are not funded
      but the company maintains book reserves and annual additions to the reserves
      are
      generally tax deductible. With the exception of the German plans, our policy
      is
      to fund the plans on a current basis to the extent deductible under existing
      tax
      laws and regulations and in amounts at least sufficient to satisfy statutory
      funding requirements. We also have defined benefit pension obligations in France
      and Austria, the assets and liabilities of which are
      insignificant.

The

                $353.6 million of the total unfunded status at December 31, 2005
                and 2004, respectively. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 is partially
                the

Current
      financial accounting standards require that the discount rates used to calculate
      the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit
      obligations reflect the time value of money as of the measurement date of
      the benefit obligation and reflect the rates of return currently available
      on
      high quality fixed income securities whose cash flows (via coupons and
      maturities) match the timing and amount of future benefit payments of the plan.
      In addition, changes in the discount rate assumption should reflect changes
      in
      the general level of interest rates.

      Employee Benefit Obligations

(continued)

In
      selecting the U.S. discount rate for December 31, 2005, several benchmarks
      were considered to provide guidance. These benchmarks included Moody's
      long-term corporate bond yield for Aa bonds and the Citigroup Pension
      Liability Index. In addition, the expected cash flows from the plans were
      modeled relative to the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and matched to cash
      flows from a portfolio of bonds rated Aa or better. In Canada the markets
      for locally denominated high-quality, longer term corporate bonds are relatively
      thin. As a result, the approach taken in Canada is to use yield curve spot
      rates
      to discount the respective benefit cash flows and to compute the underlying
      constant bond yield equivalent. The Canadian discount rate at December 31,
      2005, was selected based on a review of the expected benefit payments for each
      of the Canadian defined benefit plans over the next 60 years and then
      discounting the resulting cash flows to the measurement date using the AA
      corporate bond spot rates to determine the equivalent level discount rate.
      In
      the United Kingdom and Germany, the company and its actuarial consultants
      considered the applicable iBoxx 15+ year AA corporate bond yields for the
      respective markets and determined a rate in line with those expectations. In
      all
      countries, the discount rates selected for December 31, 2005, were based on
      the range of values obtained from cash flow specific methods, together with
      the changes in the general level of interest rates reflected by the
      benchmarks.

The
      assumption related to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
      reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide
      for the benefits over the life of the plans. The assumption is based upon Ball’s
      pension plan asset allocations, investment strategies and the views of
      investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Some reliance was
      placed on historical asset returns of our plans. An asset-return generation
      model was used to project future asset returns using simulation and asset class
      correlation. The analysis includes expected future risk premiums,
      forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds
      and the price earnings ratios of major stock market indexes, expected inflation
      and real risk-free interest rate assumptions, and the fund’s expected asset
      allocation.

The
      expected long-term rates of return on assets are calculated by applying the
      expected rate of return to a market related value of plan assets at the
      beginning of the year, adjusted for the weighted average expected contributions
      and benefit payments. For the North American plans, the market related value
      of
      plan assets used to calculate expected return was $662.4 million for 2005,
      $604.4 million for 2004 and $570.4 million for 2003.

Included
      in other comprehensive earnings, net of related tax effect, were increases
      in
      the minimum liability of $43.6 million and $33.2 million in 2005 and
      2004, respectively, and a decrease of $11.8 million in 2003.

For
      pension plans, accumulated gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent
      corridor and the prior service cost are being amortized over the average
      remaining service period of active participants.

Defined
      Benefit Pension Plan Assets

Investment
      policies and strategies for the plan assets in the U.S., Canada and the United
      Kingdom are established by pension investment committees and include the
      following common themes: (1) to provide for long-term growth of principal income
      without undue exposure to risk; (2) to minimize contributions to the plans;
      (3)
      to minimize and stabilize pension expense; and (4) to achieve a rate of return
      which is above the market average for each asset class over the long term.
      The
      pension investment committees are required to regularly, but no less frequently
      than once annually, review asset mix and asset performance, as well as the
      performance of the investment managers. Based on their reviews, which are
      generally conducted quarterly, investment policies and strategies are revised
      as
      appropriate.

Contributions
      to the company’s defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded

      change based on plan asset performance. Benefit payments related to these plans
      are expected to be $43 million, $46 million, $48 million,
      $51 million and $54 million for the years ending December 31, 2006
      through 2010, respectively, and $318 million thereafter. Payments to
      participants in the unfunded German plans are expected to be $22 million in
      2006, $22 million, $23 million, $24 million and $24 million
      in the years 2006 through 2010, respectively, and a total of $131 million
      thereafter.

Other
      Postemployment Benefits

The
      company sponsors defined benefit and defined contribution postretirement health
      care and life insurance plans for substantially all U.S. and Canadian employees.
      Employees may also qualify for long-term disability, medical and life insurance
      continuation and other postemployment benefits upon termination of active
      employment prior to retirement. All of the Ball-sponsored postretirement health
      care and life insurance plans are unfunded and, with the exception of life
      insurance benefits, are self-insured.

In
      Canada, the company provides supplemental medical and other benefits in
      conjunction with Canadian provincial health care plans. Most U.S. salaried
      employees who retired prior to 1993 are covered by noncontributory defined
      benefit medical plans with capped lifetime benefits. Ball provides a fixed
      subsidy toward each retiree's future purchase of medical insurance for U.S.
      salaried and substantially all nonunion hourly employees retiring after January
      1, 1993. Life insurance benefits are noncontributory. Ball has no commitments
      to
      increase benefits provided by any of the postemployment benefit
      plans.

The
      assumptions used for the determination of benefit obligations and net periodic
      benefit cost were the same as used for the U.S. and Canadian defined benefit
      pension plans. For other postemployment benefits, accumulated gains and losses,
      the prior service cost and the transition asset are being amortized over the
      average remaining service period of active participants.

For
      the
      U.S. health care plans at December 31, 2005, a 10 percent health care
      cost trend rate was used for pre-65 and post-65 benefits, and trend rates were
      assumed to decrease by 1 percent per year until 2011 when they reach
      5 percent and remain level thereafter. For the Canadian plans, a
      10 percent health care cost trend rate was used, which was assumed to
      decrease in one-half percent increments to 5 percent by 2016 and remain at
      that level in subsequent years.

Health
      care cost trend rates can have an effect on the amounts reported for the health
      care plan. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend
      rates
      would increase or decrease the total of service and interest cost by
      approximately $0.5 million and the postemployment benefit obligation by
      approximately $8 million to $9 million.

      Employee Benefit Obligations

(continued)

Other
      Benefit Plans

The
      company matches employee contributions to the 401(k) plan with shares of Ball
      common stock, up to 50 percent of up to 6 percent of a participant’s
      annual salary. The expense associated with the company match amounted to
      $14.3 million, $13 million and $11.7 million for 2005, 2004 and
      2003, respectively.

In
      addition, substantially all employees within the company’s aerospace and
      technologies segment who participate in Ball’s 401(k) plan receive a
      performance-based matching cash contribution of up to 4 percent of base
      salary. The company recognized $6.3 million, $4.8 million and
      $6 million of additional compensation expense related to this program for
      the years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In
      the company’s 401(k) plan matching contributions could not exceed $7,000 per
      employee due to the 401(k) aggregate limit on employee contributions of
      $14,000.

14. 
      Shareholders’ Equity

At
      December 31, 2005, the company had 550 million shares of common stock and
      15 million shares of preferred stock authorized, both without par value.
      Preferred stock includes 120,000 authorized but unissued shares designated
      as
      Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

On
      January 31, 2005, in a privately negotiated stock repurchase transaction,
      Ball entered into a forward purchase agreement to repurchase 3 million of
      its common shares at an initial price of $42.72 per share using cash on hand
      and
      available borrowings. The price per share was subject to a price adjustment
      based on a weighted average price calculation for the period between the initial
      purchase date and the settlement date. The company previously reported in its
      Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, within
      Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
      Results of Operations” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
      Data,” that the purchase of the 3 million shares occurred on
      January 31, 2005, with the immediate reduction of Ball’s outstanding
      shares. The reduction of shares was reflected in the number of outstanding
      shares disclosed on the cover page of the Form 10-K. Subsequent to the
      close of the first quarter, the company, upon further review of the transaction,
      concluded that the shares purchased under the contract should not reduce the
      outstanding shares, nor affect earnings per share, until actual delivery of
      the
      shares to the company. The company completed its purchase of the 3 million
      shares at an average price of $41.63 per share and obtained delivery of the
      shares in early May 2005.

On
      October 26, 2005, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to
      12 million shares of Ball common stock. This most recent repurchase
      authorization replaced the previous authorization of up to 12 million
      shares approved in July 2004, under which approximately 1 million
      shares remained at October 26, 2005.

On
      July
      28, 2004, the company’s board of directors declared a two-for-one split of
      Ball’s common stock. The stock split was effective August 23, 2004, for all
      shareholders of record on August 4, 2004. As a result of the stock split, all
      amounts prior to the split related to earnings, options and outstanding shares
      have been retroactively restated as if the split had occurred as of
      January 1, 2003.

      Shareholders’ Equity

(continued)

Under
      the
      company's successor Shareholder Rights Plan, one Preferred Stock Purchase Right
      (Right) is attached to each outstanding share of Ball Corporation common stock.
      Subject to adjustment, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase
      from the company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
      Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $130 per Right. If a person or group
      acquires 15 percent or more of the company's outstanding common stock (or
      upon occurrence of certain other events), the Rights (other than those held
      by
      the acquiring person) become exercisable and generally entitle the holder to
      purchase shares of Ball Corporation common stock at a 50 percent discount.
      The
      Rights, which expire in 2006, are redeemable by the company at a redemption
      price of one cent per Right and trade with the common stock. Exercise of such
      Rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to
      acquire control of the company without the approval of Ball's board of
      directors. The Rights would not interfere with any merger or other business
      combinations approved by the board of directors.

As
      a
      result of the company’s stock split, which was distributed on August 23,
      2004, the rights attaching to the shares (pursuant to the Rights agreement
      dated
      January 24, 1996) automatically split so that one-quarter of a right
      attached to each share of Ball Corporation common stock outstanding upon the
      effective date of the stock split. Ball previously split the company’s common
      stock on February 22, 2002.

In
      connection with the employee stock purchase plan, the company contributes
      20 percent of up to $500 of each participating employee’s monthly payroll
      deduction toward the purchase of Ball Corporation common stock. Company
      contributions for this plan were $3.2 million in 2005, $2.7 million in
      2004 and $2.5 million in 2003.

Notwithstanding
      the 2005 distribution pursuant to the Jobs Act, management’s intention is to
      indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings. Therefore, no taxes have been provided
      on the foreign currency translation component for any period. The change in
      the
      minimum pension liability is presented net of related tax benefit of
      $27.3 million for 2005, related tax benefit of $20.8 million for 2004
      and related tax expense of $7.7 million for 2003.

Stock
      Options and Restricted Shares

The
      company has several stock option plans under which options to purchase shares
      of
      common stock have been granted to officers and key employees at the market
      value
      of the stock at the date of grant. Payment must be made at the time of exercise
      in cash or with shares of stock owned by the option holder, which are valued
      at
      fair market value on the date exercised. Options issued through
      December 31, 2005, terminate 10 years from date of grant. Commencing one
      year from date of grant, options vest in four equal annual
      amounts.

      Shareholders’ Equity

(continued)

On
      October 26, 2005, Ball’s board of directors approved the acceleration of
      the out-of-the-money, unvested nonqualified stock options grants in
      April 2005. The acceleration affects approximately 665,000 options
      granted to approximately 290 employees at an exercise price of $39.74. The
      accelerated vesting of these nonqualified options will allow the company to
      eliminate approximately $5 million of pretax expense (approximately
      $3 million after tax) over the next four years.

Ball
      adopted a deposit share program in March 2001 that, by matching purchased
      shares with restricted shares, encourages certain senior management employees
      and outside directors to invest in Ball stock. In general, restrictions on
      the
      matching shares lapse at the end of four years from date of grant, or earlier
      if
      established share ownership guidelines are met, assuming the qualifying
      purchased shares are not sold or transferred prior to that time. This plan
      is
      currently accounted for as a variable plan where compensation expense is
      recorded based upon the current market price of the company’s common stock until
      restrictions lapse. The company recorded $7.3 million, $17.5 million
      and $10.5 million of expense in connection with this program in 2005, 2004
      and 2003, respectively. The variances in expense recorded are the result of
      the
      timing and vesting of the share grants, as well as the higher price of Ball
      stock. The deposit share program was amended and restated in April 2004 and
      further awards have been made.

Prior
      to
      passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act), Ball guaranteed loans
      made
      by a third party bank to certain participants in the deposit share program,
      of
      which $1.6 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2005. In the
      event of a participant default, Ball would pursue payment from the participant.
      The Act provides that companies may no longer guarantee such loans for its
      executive officers. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, the company
      has not and will not guarantee any additional loans to its executive
      officers.

      Shareholders’ Equity

(continued)

These
      options cannot be traded in any equity market. However, based on the
      Black-Scholes option pricing model, adapted for use in valuing compensatory
      stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123, options granted in 2005, 2004
      and
      2003 have estimated weighted average fair values at the date of grant of $11.65
      per share, $10.24 per share and $8.63 per share, respectively. The actual
      value an employee may realize will depend on the excess of the stock price
      over
      the exercise price on the date the option is exercised. Consequently, there
      is
      no assurance that the value realized by an employee will be at or near the
      value
      estimated. The fair values were estimated using the following weighted average
      assumptions:

                2004.

Effective
      January 1, 2006, Ball adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share
      Based Payment,” which is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes
      APB Opinion No. 25. The new standard establishes accounting
      standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments
      for goods or services, including stock option and restricted stock grants.
      On
      March 29, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff
      Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, which summarizes the views of the SEC
      staff regarding the interaction between SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) and certain
      SEC rules and regulations and provides the SEC staff’s views regarding the
      valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public companies. The major
      differences for Ball in 2006 and future years includes (1) the fact that
      there will be expense recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings for
      the
      fair value of option grants and (2) the deposit share program will no
      longer be a variable plan that is marked to current market value each month
      (the
      original fair value at date of grant will be used to determine the expense).
      Upon adoption, Ball has chosen to use the modified prospective transition method
      and, at least initially, the Black-Scholes valuation model.

      Financial Instruments and Risk Management

Policies
      and Procedures

In
      the
      ordinary course of business, we employ established risk management policies
      and
      procedures to reduce our exposure to commodity price changes, changes in
      interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currencies and fluctuations in prices
      of
      the company’s common stock in regard to common share repurchases. Although the
      instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit, market and interest
      risk, the counterparties are expected to perform fully under the terms of the
      agreements.

Commodity
      Price Risk

We
      manage
      our North American commodity price risk in connection with market price
      fluctuations of aluminum primarily by entering into container sales contracts,
      which include aluminum-based pricing terms that consider price fluctuations
      under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases. The terms include
      a fixed price or an upper limit to the aluminum component pricing. This matched
      pricing affects most of our North American metal beverage container net sales.
      We also, at times, use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward
      contracts as cash flow and fair value hedges of commodity price risk where
      there
      is not a pass-through arrangement in the sales contract.

North
      American plastic container sales contracts include provisions to pass through
      resin cost changes. As a result, we believe we have minimal, if any, exposure
      related to changes in the cost of plastic resin. Most North American food
      container sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass
      through some or all steel cost changes we incur or incorporate annually
      negotiated steel costs. In 2005 and 2004, we were able to pass through to our
      customers the majority of steel surcharges.

      Financial Instruments and Risk Management

(continued)

In
      Europe
      and Asia, the company manages the aluminum and steel raw commodity price risks
      through annual and long-term contracts for the purchase of the materials, as
      well as certain sales of containers, that reduce the company’s exposure to
      fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year. These purchase and
      sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass through pricing
      arrangements. The company additionally uses forward and option contracts as
      cash
      flow hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures
      for those sales contracts where there is not a pass through arrangement to
      minimize the company’s exposure to significant price changes.

At
      December 31, 2005, the company had aluminum forward contracts with notional
      amounts of $406.1 million hedging its aluminum exposure. Cash flow and fair
      value hedges related to forecasted transactions and firm commitments expire
      within the next three years.

Included
      in shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2005, within accumulated other
      comprehensive loss, is a net loss of $5.5 million associated with these
      contracts, of which a net loss of $19.8 million is expected to be
      recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during 2006. All of the
      loss on these derivative contracts will be offset by higher revenue from sales
      contracts. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005, includes
      $36.6 million in prepaid expenses and $72.9 million in other current
      liabilities related to unrealized gains/losses on unsettled derivative
      contracts. At December 31, 2004, the company had aluminum forward and
      option contracts with notional amounts of $303.4 million hedging its
      aluminum exposure.

Interest
      Rate Risk

Our
      objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the
      impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our
      overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we use a variety of
      interest rate swaps, collars and options to manage our mix of floating and
      fixed-rate debt. Interest rate instruments held by the company at
      December 31, 2005, included pay-floating and pay-fixed interest rate swaps.
      Pay-fixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate
      instruments. Swap agreements expire at various times up to 11 years.

At
      December 31, 2005, the company had outstanding interest rate swap
      agreements in Europe of €50 million paying fixed rates. Approximately
€0.1 million of net loss associated with these contracts is included in
      accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2005. The amount
      expected to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during
      the
      next 12 months is insignificant. In conjunction with the debt refinancing
      and the retirement of the senior notes during the fourth quarter of 2005 (see
      Note 11), the company recognized approximately $1 million of net gain
      related to the termination or deselection of hedges that had been included
      in
      accumulated other comprehensive loss. At December 31, 2004, the company had
      interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of $220 million paying
      floating rates and $120 million paying fixed rates, or a net floating
      position of $100 million. In addition, at December 31, 2004, the
      company had an interest rate cap on Eurolibor interest rates with a notional
      amount of €50 million, the fair value of which was
      insignificant.

The
      fair
      value of all non-derivative financial instruments approximates their carrying
      amounts with the exception of long-term debt. Rates currently available to
      the
      company for loans with similar terms and maturities are used to estimate the
      fair value of long-term debt based on discounted cash flows. The fair value
      of
      derivatives generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay or
      receive upon termination of the contracts at December 31, 2005, taking into
      account any unrealized gains and losses on open contracts.

Foreign
      Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Our
      objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect
      foreign cash flows and earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate
      changes through the use of cash flow hedges. In addition, we manage foreign
      earnings translation volatility through the use of foreign currency options.
      Our
      foreign currency translation risk results from the European euro, British pound,
      Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Serbian dinar, Brazilian real and Chinese
      renminbi. We face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of
      purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars and, to a lesser extent, in other
      currencies. Sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost
      changes and, where there is not a foreign exchange pass-through arrangement,
      the
      company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures.
      Contracts outstanding at December 31, 2005, expire within the next three years
      and there are no amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss
      related to these contracts.

17. 
        Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)

The
        company’s fiscal years end on December 31 and the fiscal quarters generally
        end on the Sunday nearest the calendar quarter end.

        Quarterly Information

The
        second quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge of $8.8 million for the
        closure of a three-piece food can manufacturing plant in Quebec, Canada.
        The
        third quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge of $19.3 million related to
        the commencement of a project to upgrade and streamline its North American
        beverage can end manufacturing capabilities. Included in the fourth quarter
        of
        2005 was a pretax charge of $4.6 million for costs associated with a
        reduction in the work force in a metal food container plant in Ontario, Canada,
        which was partially offset by a $2.2 million gain to adjust the net
        realizable value of the Quebec plant closed in the second quarter of 2005.
        Also
        included in the third and fourth quarters were $1.3 million and
        $18 million of debt refinancing charges related to the refinancing of
        Ball’s senior secured credit facilities and redemption of the company’s senior
        notes due August 2006. Other than these items, fluctuations in sales and
        earnings for the quarters in 2005 reflected the number of days in each fiscal
        quarter, as well as the normal seasonality of the business.

        Quarterly Information

The
        third
        and fourth quarters of 2004 included earnings of $6.7 million and
        $8.5 million, respectively, related to business consolidation activities
        for which proceeds on assets were higher than originally estimated and costs
        of
        completion were less than anticipated. The fourth quarter also included a
        $15.2 million loss pertaining to an allowance for doubtful accounts related
        to a minority-owned PRC joint venture. Other than these items, fluctuations
        in
        sales and earnings for the quarters in 2004 reflected the number of days
        in each
        fiscal quarter, as well as the normal seasonality of the
        business.

        Research and Development

Research
        and development costs are expensed as incurred in connection with the company’s
        internal programs for the development of products and processes. Costs incurred
        in connection with these programs, the majority of which are included in
        cost of
        sales, amounted to $24.6 million, $25.5 million and $20.5 million
        for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
        respectively.

19. 
        Subsidiary Guarantees of Debt

As
        discussed in Note 11, the company’s notes payable and senior credit
        facilities are guaranteed on a full, unconditional and joint and several
        basis
        by certain of the company’s domestic wholly owned subsidiaries. Certain foreign
        denominated tranches of the senior credit facilities are similarly guaranteed
        by
        certain of the company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. The senior credit
        facilities are secured by: (1) a pledge of 100 percent of the stock owned
        by the company in its material direct and indirect majority-owned domestic
        subsidiaries and (2) a pledge of the company’s stock, owned directly or
        indirectly, of certain foreign subsidiaries, which equals 65 percent of the
        stock of each such foreign subsidiary. The following is condensed, consolidating
        financial information for the company, segregating the guarantor subsidiaries
        and non-guarantor subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and for
        the
        years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in millions of dollars).
        Separate financial statements for the guarantor subsidiaries and the
        non-guarantor subsidiaries are not presented because management has determined
        that such financial statements would not be material to
        investors.

20. 
      Subsequent Event

On
      February 14, 2006, the company entered into a definitive merger agreement
      in which Ball will acquire U.S. Can Corporation’s (U.S. Can) U.S. and
      Argentinean operations for 1.1 million shares of Ball common stock and
      the assumption of $550 million of U.S. Can’s debt. The transaction is
      expected to close by the end of the first quarter 2006. U.S. Can is the largest
      manufacturer of aerosol cans in the U.S. and also manufactures paint cans,
      plastic containers and custom and specialty cans in 10 plants in the U.S.
      Aerosol cans are also produced in the two manufacturing plants in Argentina.
      U.S. Can’s U.S. and Argentinean operations had sales of approximately
      $600 million (unaudited) in 2005. Upon closing the acquisition of U.S. Can,
      the company intends to refinance $550 million of existing U.S. Can debt at
      significantly lower interest rates. The refinancing will be completed with
      Ball’s issuance of a new series of senior notes and an increase in bank debt
      under the new senior credit facilities put in place in the fourth quarter of
      2005.

21. 
      Contingencies

The
      company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course
      of
      business due, in part, to the competitive nature of the industries in which
      we
      participate, our operations in developing markets, changing commodity prices
      for
      the materials used in the manufacture of our products and changing capital
      markets. Where practicable, we attempt to reduce these risks and uncertainties
      through the establishment of risk management policies and procedures, including,
      at times, the use of certain derivative financial instruments.

From
      time
      to time, the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its business.
      Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated Ball
      as a
      potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the
      cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Our information at this time does
      not
      indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the
      liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the
      company.

Due
      to
      political and legal uncertainties in Germany, no nationwide system for returning
      beverage containers was in place at the time a mandatory deposit was imposed
      in
      January 2003 and nearly all retailers stopped carrying beverages in
      non-refillable containers. During 2003 and 2004, we responded to the resulting
      lower demand for beverage cans by reducing production at our German plants,
      implementing aggressive cost reduction measures and increasing exports from
      Germany to other countries in the region served by Ball Packaging Europe. We
      also closed a plant in the United Kingdom, shut down a production line in
      Germany, delayed capital investment projects in France and Poland and converted
      one of our steel can production lines in Germany to aluminum in order to
      facilitate additional can exports from Germany.  In 2004 the German
      parliament adopted a new packaging ordinance, imposing a 25 eurocent deposit
      on
      all one-way glass, PET and metal containers for water, beer and carbonated
      soft
      drinks. As of May 1, 2006, all retailers must redeem all returned one-way
      containers as long as they sell such containers. Major retailers in Germany
      have
      begun the process of implementing a returnable system for one-way containers
      since they, along with fillers, now appear to accept the deposit as permanent.
      The retailers and the filling and packaging industries have formed a committee
      to design a nationwide recollection system and several retailers have begun
      to
      order reverse vending machines in order to meet the May 1, 2006,
      deadline.

22. 
      Indemnifications and Guarantees

During
      the normal course of business, the company or the appropriate consolidated
      direct or indirect subsidiaries have made certain indemnities, commitments
      and
      guarantees under which the specified entity may be required to make payments
      in
      relation to certain transactions. These indemnities, commitments and guarantees
      include indemnities to the customers of the subsidiaries in connection with
      the
      sales of their packaging and aerospace products and services, guarantees to
      suppliers of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the company guaranteeing the
      performance of the respective entity under a purchase agreement, indemnities
      for
      liabilities associated with the infringement of third party patents, trademarks
      or copyrights under various types of agreements, indemnities to various lessors
      in connection with facility, equipment, furniture, and other personal property
      leases for certain claims arising from such leases, indemnities pursuant to
      agreements relating to certain joint ventures, indemnities in connection with
      the sale of businesses or substantially all of the assets and specified
      liabilities of businesses, and indemnities to directors, officers and employees
      of the company to the extent permitted under the laws of the State of Indiana
      and the United States of America. The duration of these indemnities, commitments
      and guarantees varies, and in certain cases, is indefinite. In addition, the
      majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for
      any
      limitation on the maximum potential future payments the company could be
      obligated to make. As such, the company is unable to reasonably estimate its
      potential exposure under these items. The company has not recorded any liability
      for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees in the accompanying
      consolidated balance sheets. The company does, however, accrue for payments
      under promissory notes and other evidences of incurred indebtedness and for
      losses for any known contingent liability, including those that may arise from
      indemnifications, commitments and guarantees, when future payment is both
      reasonably determinable and probable. Finally, the company carries specific
      and
      general liability insurance policies and has obtained indemnities, commitments
      and guarantees from third party purchasers, sellers and other contracting
      parties, which the company believes would, in many circumstances, provide
      recourse to any claims arising from these indemnifications, commitments and
      guarantees.

The
      company’s senior notes and senior credit facilities are guaranteed on a full,
      unconditional and joint and several basis by certain of the company’s wholly
      owned domestic subsidiaries. Certain foreign denominated tranches of the senior
      credit facilities are similarly guaranteed by certain of the company’s wholly
      owned foreign subsidiaries. These guarantees are required in support of the
      notes and credit facilities referred to above, are co-terminous with the terms
      of the respective note indentures and credit agreement and would require
      performance upon certain events of default referred to in the respective
      guarantees. The maximum potential amounts which could be required to be paid
      under the guarantees are essentially equal to the then outstanding principal
      and
      interest under the respective notes and credit agreement, or under the
      applicable tranche. The company is not in default under the above notes or
      credit facilities.

Ball
      Capital Corp. II is a separate, wholly owned corporate entity created for the
      purchase of receivables from certain of the company’s wholly owned subsidiaries.
      Ball Capital Corp. II’s assets will be available first and foremost to satisfy
      the claims of its creditors. The company has provided an undertaking to Ball
      Capital Corp. II in support of the sale of receivables to a commercial lender
      or
      lenders which would require performance upon certain events of default referred
      to in the undertaking. The maximum potential amount which could be paid is
      equal
      to the outstanding amounts due under the accounts receivable financing (see
      Note 5). The company, the appropriate subsidiaries and Ball Capital Corp.
      II are not in default under the above credit arrangement.

From
      time
      to time, the company is subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of
      business. In the opinion of management, no such matter, individually or in
      the
      aggregate, exists which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the
      company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
      flows.

Controls
      and Procedures

Evaluation
      of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We
      have
      established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
      information relating to the company, including its consolidated subsidiaries,
      is
      made known to the officers who certify the company’s financial reports and to
      other members of senior management and the board of directors.

Based
      on
      their evaluation as of December 31, 2005, the chief executive officer and
      chief financial officer of the company have concluded that the company’s
      disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
      under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the
      information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it
      files
      or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
      summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and
      forms.

Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our
      management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
      control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
      Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our
      management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
      we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
      financial reporting based on the framework in “Internal Control - Integrated
      Framework”

issued
      by
      the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based
      on
      our evaluation under the framework in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework,”
our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
      was
      effective as of December 31, 2005. Our management’s assessment of the
      effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
      December 31, 2005, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
      independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which
      is included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
      Data.”

Changes
      in Internal Control

The
      company is in the process of migrating the North American metal beverage
      manufacturing and inventory system from a legacy system to a fully integrated
      business system (the new system). To date, we have converted four metal beverage
      plants to the new system and the migrations will continue into 2006 and 2007.
      The migration involved changes in systems that included internal controls.
      We
      have reviewed the new system and the controls affected by the implementation
      of
      the new system and made appropriate changes to affected internal controls.
      The
      controls as modified are appropriate and operating effectively. There were
      no
      other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year
      ended December 31, 2005, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
      likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
      reporting.

Stock
                options were granted on April 27, 2005, and were exercisable
                beginning one year after the grant and each year thereafter in
                25 percent increments. Effective October 26, 2005, the options
                became fully exercisable as a result of an acceleration of
                vesting.

(2)

Stock
                options with an expiration date of April 27, 2015, have an estimated
                value, at date of grant, of $11.65 per share based on the Black-Scholes
                option-pricing model adapted for use in valuing employee stock options.
                The estimated values under the Black-Scholes model are based on weighted
                average assumptions of volatility of 30.09 percent, a risk-free rate
                of return of 3.89 percent, a dividend yield of 1.01 percent, an
                expected option term of 4.75 years, and no adjustment for the risk of
                forfeiture. The actual value, if any, an executive may realize will
                depend
                on the excess of the stock price over the exercise price on the date
                the
                option is exercised. Consequently, there is no assurance the value
                realized by an executive will be at or near the value estimated by
                the
                Black-Scholes model.

Participants
                are not awarded a number of units. Awards are expressed as a percentage
                of
                average annual salary and “bonus” at target during the performance period.
                However, Named Executive Officers whose Ball Corporation stock holdings
                are below the established guidelines will receive up to one-half
                of their
                award in Ball Corporation Restricted
                Stock.

(2)

Estimated
                future payouts (“earned awards”) are based on Ball Corporation’s total
                shareholder return performance; i.e., stock price appreciation plus
                dividends, over three-year performance cycles which begin at the
                start of
                each calendar year, relative to the total shareholder return of companies
                listed on the S&P Global Industry Classification Standard (“GICS”)
                which has replaced the S&P Industrials
                index.

Mr. Fiedler
                retired at the end of 2005. Estimated future payouts for the performance
                period are prorated based on his service through
                2005.

Retirement
      Plans

The
      following table, for purposes of illustration, indicates the amounts of annual
      retirement income which would be payable in 2006 to the Named Executive
      Officers, except Mr. Fiedler, at normal retirement age 65. The calculation
      of retirement benefits under the plans generally is based upon average earnings
      (base salary only) for the highest five consecutive years of the ten years
      preceding retirement.

The
      corporation’s qualified United States salaried
      retirement plans provide defined benefits determined by base salary and years
      of
      service. The corporation has also adopted a nonqualified Supplemental Executive
      Retirement Plan that provides benefits otherwise not payable under the qualified
      pension plan to the extent that the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
      (the “Code”), limits the pension to which an executive would be entitled under
      the qualified pension plan. The benefit amounts shown in the preceding table
      reflect the amount payable as a straight life annuity and include amounts
      payable under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. On November 30,
      2003, the corporation terminated the Split-Dollar Life Insurance Plan that
      provided a portion of the

nonqualified
      pension benefit. Mr. Seabrook elected a cash distribution from this plan
      that will reduce his retirement benefit.

Average
      annual earnings used under the pension formula to calculate benefits together
      with years of benefit service, as of December 31, 2005, for the Named
      Executive Officers are: R. David Hoover, $777,421 (35.54 years);
      John R. Friedery, $312,500 (17.33 years); Raymond J.
      Seabrook, $327,200 (13.21 years); and David A. Westerlund,
      $289,800 (30.32 years) offset by benefits received from a prior
      employer.

Mr. Fiedler’s
      retirement income benefits are provided by a pension agreement that is part
      of
      his employment agreement. The agreement provides a benefit of 60 percent of
      his last gross base salary provided he is employed on the earlier of
      December 31, 2005, or reaches age 60 and retires in good standing from
      the corporation. Mr. Fiedler retired as an employee of the corporation at
      the end of 2005 and his retirement benefit is €300,000 per year based on
      his 2005 salary of €500,000.

Termination
      of Employment and Change-in-Control Arrangements

The
      corporation maintains revocable, funded grantor trusts, which, in the event
      a
      change in control of the corporation occurs, would become irrevocable with
      funds
      thereunder to be available to apply to the corporation’s obligations under its
      deferred compensation plans covering key employees, including the Named
      Executive Officers, except Mr. Fiedler. Under the trusts, a “change in
      control” can occur by virtue, in general terms, of an acquisition by any person
      of 40 percent or more of the corporation’s voting shares; a merger in which
      shareholders of the corporation before the merger own less than 60 percent
      of the corporation’s common stock after the merger; shareholder approval of a
      plan to sell or dispose of substantially all of the assets of the corporation;
      a
      change of a majority of the corporation’s board within a 12-month period unless
      approved by two-thirds of the directors in office at the beginning of such
      period; a threatened change in control deemed to exist if there is an agreement
      which

would
      result in a change in control or public announcement of intentions to cause
      a
      change in control; and by the adoption by the board of a resolution to the
      effect that a change or threatened change in control has occurred for purposes
      of the trusts. For amounts deferred on or after January 1, 2005, the
      definition of “change in control” has the meaning set forth in Section 409A
      of the Code, or any Treasury Department regulations or guidance. The trusts
      were
      funded as of December 31, 2005, with approximately $57.0 million of
      net equity of corporate-owned life insurance policies on the lives of various
      employees, including participants in the plans, and 1,037,890 shares of the
      corporation’s common stock and cash equivalents valued at $41.3 million
      ($39.72 per share) at the close of business on December 31, 2005, to
      support approximately $171.6 million of current deferred compensation
      account balances of the beneficiaries of the trusts in the event of a change
      in
      control. The corporation has borrowing capacity to fully fund the trusts in
      advance of a change in control and is required to do so prior to a change in
      control. If the funds set aside in the trusts would be insufficient to pay
      amounts due the beneficiaries, then the corporation would remain obligated
      to
      pay those amounts. In the event of the insolvency of the corporation, the funds
      in the trusts would be available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of
      the
      corporation. The trusts were not established in response to any effort to
      acquire control of the corporation, and the board is not aware of any such
      effort.

The
        corporation intends to establish separate revocable, funded grantor trusts
        in
        2006 which adopt the definition of “change in control” as set forth in the
        Treasury Department’s guidance and any regulations issued under
        Section 409A of the Code.

The
        corporation has change-in-control severance agreements with certain key
        employees, including the Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Fiedler. The
        agreements are effective on a year-to-year basis and would provide severance
        benefits in the event of both a change in control of the corporation and
        an
        actual or constructive termination of employment within two years after a
        change
        in control. Under the agreements, a “change in control” can occur by virtue, in
        general terms, of an acquisition by any person of 30 percent or more of the
        corporation’s voting shares; a merger in which the shareholders of the
        corporation before the merger own 50 percent or less of the corporation’s
        voting shares after the merger; shareholder approval of a plan of liquidation
        or
        a plan to sell or dispose of substantially all of the assets of the corporation;
        and if, during any two-year period, directors at the beginning of the period
        fail to constitute a majority of the board. “Actual termination” is any
        termination other than by death or disability, by the corporation for cause,
        or
        by the executive, other than for constructive termination. “Constructive
        termination” means, in general terms, any significant reduction in duties,
        compensation or benefits or change of office location from those in effect
        immediately prior to the change in control, unless agreed to by the executive.
        The severance benefits payable, in addition to base salary and incentive
        compensation accrued through

Page
              88 of

the
        date
        of termination, shall include two times current annual base salary and target
        incentive compensation; the bargain element value of then-outstanding stock
        options; the present value of the amount by which pension payments would
        have
        been larger had the executive accumulated two additional years of benefit
        service; two years of life, disability, accident and health benefits;
        outplacement services; and legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred in
        enforcing the agreements. In the event such benefits, together with other
        benefits paid because of a change in control, would be subject to the excise
        tax
        imposed under Section 280G of the Code, the corporation would reimburse the
        executive for such excise taxes paid, together with taxes incurred as a result
        of such reimbursement. The agreements were not entered into in response to
        any
        effort to acquire control of the corporation, and the board is not aware
        of any
        such effort.

The
      corporation has severance benefit agreements with certain key employees,
      including the Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Fiedler. The agreements
      provide severance benefits in the event of an actual or constructive termination
      of employment. “Actual termination” is any termination other than by death or
      disability, by the corporation for cause, or by the executive, other than for
      constructive termination. “Constructive termination” means, in general terms,
      any significant reduction in compensation or benefits, unless agreed to by
      the
      executive. The severance benefits payable, in addition to base salary and
      incentive compensation accrued through the date of termination, include two
      times current annual salary and target incentive compensation for
      Mr. Hoover and one and one-half times current annual salary and target
      incentive compensation for Messrs. Friedery, Seabrook and Westerlund; the
      present value of the amount by which pension payments would have been larger
      had
      the executive accumulated two additional years of benefit service for
      Mr. Hoover and one and one-half years of benefit service for
      Messrs. Friedery, Seabrook and Westerlund; two years of life, disability,
      accident and health benefits for Mr. Hoover and one and one-half years of
      life, disability, accident and health benefits for Messrs. Friedery,
      Seabrook and Westerlund; outplacement services; and legal fees and expenses
      reasonably incurred in enforcing the agreements.

Upon
      the
      occurrence of a change in control as defined in the change-in-control severance
      agreements, the executive is entitled to the greater of each of the benefits
      provided in this agreement and each of the benefits provided in the
      change-in-control severance agreement, including reimbursement for excise taxes
      which may be incurred as a result of such payments.

The
        corporation entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Fiedler
        negotiated in connection with the acquisition of Schmalbach-Lubeca AG and
        effective from December 19, 2002, through December 31, 2005. That
        agreement has expired and Mr. Fiedler retired as an employee of the
        corporation at the end of 2005.

Directors’
        Compensation

Directors
        who are not employees of the corporation receive as compensation a total
        target
        annual retainer composed of a $30,000 annual fixed retainer, plus an annual
        incentive retainer based upon the corporation’s actual operating performance for
        each fiscal (calendar) year. The annual incentive retainer is calculated
        in
        accordance with the corporation’s performance-based incentive compensation plan
        at a rate of 50 percent of the director’s annual fixed retainer. Both
        annual retainers are paid 50 percent in cash and 50 percent in
        restricted stock. The restrictions on the stock will lapse upon the director
        ceasing to serve as a director for any reason other than voluntary resignation,
        in which case the restrictions will not lapse and the director will forfeit
        the
        shares. For federal income tax purposes, the value of the shares will be
        taxable
        to the recipient as compensation income in an amount equal to the fair market
        value of the corporation’s common stock on the date the restrictions lapse.
        There has been no retirement plan for directors since 1997.

Nonemployee
        directors also receive a fee of $1,500 for attending each board meeting, a
        fee of $1,250 for attending one or more committee meetings held on any one
        day and a fee of $1,250 per quarter for serving as a chair of a board
        committee and a per diem allowance of $750 for special assignments.
        Directors who are also employees of the corporation receive no additional
        compensation for their service on the board or on any board committee.
        Nonemployee directors may elect to defer the payment of a portion or all
        of
        their directors’ fees or retainers into the 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan for
        Directors or a portion or all of their directors’ annual incentive retainer into
        the 2005 Deferred Compensation Company Stock Plan. These plans replace the
        directors’ prior deferred compensation plans for fees and retainers earned prior
        to 2005. Amounts deferred or transferred into the 2005 Deferred Compensation
        Company Stock Plan receive a 20 percent company match with a maximum match
        of $20,000 per year. Amounts deferred, transferred or credited to this plan
        will be represented in the participant’s account as stock units, with each unit
        having the value equivalent to one share of Ball Corporation common stock.
        All
        distributions of accounts will be made in the form of Ball common stock
        following termination of each director’s service. Amounts deferred to the 2005

Page 89
          of 97

Deferred
      Compensation Plan for Directors are “invested” among various investment funds
      available under the Plan.  A participant’s amounts are not actually
      invested in the investment funds for the account, but the return on a
      participant’s account is determined as if the amounts were notionally invested
      in those funds.

Each
      nonemployee director will receive a 4,000-share restricted stock award upon
      reelection for a three-year term. Each newly eligible nonemployee director
      will
      receive a 4,000-share restricted stock award upon election or appointment for
      an
      initial term (except initial terms of less than one year), and upon reelection
      for a three-year term. The restrictions against disposal of the stock will
      lapse
      upon the termination of the director’s service to the corporation as a director,
      for whatever reason other than voluntary resignation during a term, in which
      case the restrictions will not lapse and the director will forfeit the shares.
      For federal income tax purposes, the value of the stock will be taxable to
      the
      director as compensation income in an amount equal to the fair market value
      of
      the common stock on the date the restrictions lapse. Messrs. Smart, Solso
      and Taylor each received a 4,000-share restricted stock award upon reelection
      as
      directors on April 27, 2005, under the terms of the 2005 Stock and Cash
      Incentive Plan. The corporation has established a 10,000 share stock ownership
      guideline for each non-management director.

In
        the corporation implemented a Deposit Share Program for its nonemployee
        directors. The program is intended to increase share ownership by directors
        who
        must make additional investments in the corporation’s common stock to
        participate in the program. Under this program, each director receives one
        share
        of restricted stock for every share acquired by the director. Restricted
        stock
        is granted pursuant to the shareholder approved Ball Corporation 2005 Stock
        and
        Cash Incentive Plan or its successor. Under the terms of the Deposit Share
        Program for Directors, which was amended and restated in April 2004, future
        awards have share acquisition periods and restricted stock lapse provisions
        established at the time of the award. On January 26, 2005, Mr. Smart
        was granted the opportunity to participate in the program up to a maximum
        of
        6,000 shares that must be acquired during a two-year period beginning on
        the
        grant date. No other deposit share grants were made to nonemployee directors
        pursuant to the Amended and Restated Deposit Share Program during
        2005.
