INDEX

PART
I

Item
1.    Business

Ball
Corporation (Ball, we, the company or our) is one of the world’s leading
suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage, food and household
products industries. Our packaging products are produced for a variety of end
uses and are manufactured in plants around the world. We also supply
aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial
customers within our aerospace and technologies segment (Ball Aerospace). In
2008 our total consolidated net sales were $7.6 billion. Our packaging
businesses are responsible for 90 percent of that number, with the remaining 10
percent contributed from our aerospace business.

Our
largest product lines are aluminum and steel beverage cans, which contributed
65 percent of our 2008 total net sales and 75 percent of our 2008
total segment earnings before interest and taxes. We also produce steel food
cans, steel aerosol cans, polyethylene terepthalate (PET) and polypropylene
plastic bottles for beverages and foods, plastic pails, steel paint cans and
decorative steel tins. Our ongoing packaging business dates back to 1969 when
Ball began supplying beverage cans.

We sell
our packaging products primarily to major beverage, food and household products
companies with which we have developed long-term customer relationships. This is
evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long-term
supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a majority
of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in North America,
Europe, the People

’

s Republic of
China (PRC) and Argentina, as do our equity joint ventures in Brazil, the U.S.
and the PRC.

Ball
Aerospace is a leader in the design, development and manufacture of innovative
aerospace systems. It produces spacecraft, instruments and sensors, radio
frequency and microwave technologies, data exploitation solutions and a variety
of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions.
Our packaging and aerospace businesses share a long history and a common
financial philosophy, and we benefit from the presence of each.

Our
corporate strategy is to grow our worldwide beverage can business and our
aerospace business, to improve the performance of the metal food and household
products packaging, Americas, and plastic packaging, Americas, segments and to
utilize free cash flow and earnings growth to increase shareholder
value.

We are
headquartered in Broomfield, Colorado, and employ approximately
14,500 people worldwide. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange
and the Chicago Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BLL. Our predecessor
company was founded in 1880 by five Ball brothers and operated for many years as
Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing Company.

Our
Financial Strategy

Ball
Corporation maintains a clear and disciplined financial strategy focused on
improving shareholder returns through:

●

Focusing
      on free cash flow generation

●

Increasing
      Economic Value Added (EVA®)

●

Delivering
      long-term earnings per share growth of 10 percent to 15 percent over
      time

The cash
generated by our businesses is used primarily: (1) to finance the company's
operations, (2) to fund stock buy-back programs and dividend payments, (3) to
fund strategic investments and (4) to service the company's debt. We also
will, when we believe it will benefit the company and our shareholders, make
strategic acquisitions or divest parts of our business.

The
compensation of a majority of our employees is tied directly to the company’s
performance through our EVA® incentive program. When the company performs well,
our employees are paid more. If the company does not perform well, our employees
get paid less or no incentive compensation.

Our
Reporting Segments

Ball
Corporation reports its financial performance in

five reportable segments
organized along a combination of product lines, after aggregating operating
segments that have similar economic characteristics: (1) metal beverage
packaging, Americas and Asia; (2) metal beverage packaging, Europe;
(3) metal food and household products packaging, Americas; (4) plastic
packaging, Americas; and (5) aerospace and technologies. We also have
investments in companies in the U.S., the PRC and Brazil, which are accounted
for using the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are
not included in segment sales or earnings. Due to first quarter 2008 management
reporting changes, Ball’s operations in the PRC with 2008 net sales of
$289.6 million are now aggregated and included in the metal beverage
packaging, Americas and Asia, segment (previously included within the company’s
European operations). Prior periods required to be shown in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K (Annual Report) have been conformed to the current
presentation.

Profitability
is sensitive to selling prices, production volumes, labor, transportation,
utility and warehousing costs, as well as the availability and price of raw
materials, such as aluminum sheet, tinplate steel, plastic resin and other
direct materials. These raw materials are generally available from several
sources, and we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies and are
not experiencing any shortages. There has been significant consolidation of
suppliers in both North America and in Europe. Raw materials and energy sources,
such as natural gas and electricity, may from time to time be in short supply or
unavailable due to external factors, and the pass through of steel and aluminum
costs to our customers may be limited in some instances. We cannot predict the
timing or effects, if any, of such occurrences on future
operations.

A
substantial part of Ball’s packaging sales are made directly to companies in
packaged beverage and food businesses, including SABMiller plc and bottlers of
Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola branded beverages and their affiliates that utilize
consolidated purchasing groups. Additional details about sales to major
customers are included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, which
can be found in Item 8 of this Annual Report (Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data).

Metal
Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia, Segment

Industry Background and
Ball’s Operations

According
to publicly available information and company estimates, the combined U.S. and
Canada metal beverage container markets decreased in 2008 to 101 billion
units from 105 billion units in 2007. Five companies manufacture
substantially all of the metal beverage containers in the U.S. and Canada. Two
of these producers and three other independent producers also manufacture metal
beverage containers in Mexico. Ball produced in excess of 30 billion
recyclable beverage cans in the U.S. and Canada in 2008 – about 30 percent
of the total market. Sales volumes of metal beverage containers in North America
tend to be highest during the period from April through September. All of the
beverage cans produced by Ball in the U.S. and Canada are made of aluminum, as
are all beverage cans produced by our competitors in the U.S., Canada and
Mexico. In 2008 we were able to pass through substantially all aluminum-related
cost increases levied by producers. In North America, four aluminum suppliers
provide virtually all of our requirements. Some of those aluminum suppliers have
experienced significant financial and liquidity constraints in recent years,
which may be exacerbated by the global economic crisis.

We
believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum
sheet as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most aluminum container
sales contracts to pass through aluminum cost changes, as well as the use of
derivative instruments.

Beverage
containers are sold in a highly competitive market based on quality, service and
price, which is relatively capital intensive and is characterized by plants that
run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably. In addition the
aluminum beverage can competes aggressively with other packaging materials. The
glass bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry, while the PET
container has grown significantly in the carbonated soft drink and water
industries over the past quarter century. In Canada, metal beverage containers
have captured significantly lower percentages of packaged beverage industry
volumes than in the U.S., particularly in the packaged beer
industry.

Page 2 of

Metal
beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, is Ball’s largest segment, accounting for
40 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008. Metal beverage containers are
primarily sold under multi-year supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft
drinks, beer, energy drinks and other beverages. Decorated two-piece aluminum
beverage cans are produced at 14 manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and one in
Canada. Can ends are produced within two of the U.S. facilities, as well as in a
third facility that manufactures only ends. Through Rocky Mountain Metal
Container, LLC, a 50:50 joint venture, which is accounted for as an equity
investment, Ball and MillerCoors, LLC, operate beverage can and end
manufacturing facilities in Golden, Colorado. On July 1, 2008, the U.S. and
Puerto Rico businesses of Coors Brewing Company (Coors) and our largest North
American brewery customer, Miller Brewing Company (Miller), were combined to
form MillerCoors, LLC.

The
beverage can market in the PRC is approximately 12 billion cans, of which
Ball’s operations represent an estimated 22 percent, with an additional
13 percent manufactured by two joint ventures in which we participate. Our
percentage of the industry makes us one of the largest manufacturers of beverage
cans in the PRC. Six other manufacturers make up the remainder of the market.
Our operations include the manufacture of aluminum cans and ends in three plants
in the PRC, as well as in our two joint ventures. We also manufacture and sell
high-density plastic containers in two PRC plants primarily servicing the motor
oil industry. Capacity grew rapidly in the PRC in the late 1990s, resulting in a
supply/demand imbalance. A number of can makers, including Ball, responded by
rationalizing capacity. Demand growth has resumed over the past several years,
and we expect the PRC market to continue to grow over time, after the effects of
the current global economic crisis begin to dissipate.

We
participate in a 50:50 joint venture in Brazil, Latapack-Ball Embalagens, Ltda.,
that manufactures aluminum cans and ends and is accounted for as an equity
investment. The Brazilian joint venture is expanding capacity at its existing
facility near Sao Paulo and is building a new plant near Rio de
Janeiro.

In order
to more closely balance capacity and demand within our business, during 2008
Ball announced or completed the closure of three metal beverage packaging plants
in North America:

●

We
      closed a metal beverage packaging plant in Kent, Washington. The plant had
      two 12-ounce aluminum beverage can manufacturing lines that produced
      approximately 1.1 billion cans annually. The closure is expected to
      result in net fixed costs savings of approximately $10 million in
      2009.

●

We
      announced on October 30, 2008, the closure of our metal beverage can
      plants in Kansas City, Missouri, and Guayama, Puerto Rico. The Kansas City
      plant, which primarily manufactures specialty beverage cans, will be
      closed by the end of the first quarter 2009 with manufacturing volumes
      absorbed by other North American beverage can plants. The Puerto Rico
      facility, which manufactured 12-ounce beverage cans, was closed at the end
      of 2008. Cost reductions associated with these plant closings are expected
      to be up to $30 million in 2009 and be $7 million cash positive upon final
      disposition of the assets.

Where
growth is projected in certain markets or for certain products, Ball is
undertaking selected capacity increases in its existing facilities and may
establish or obtain additional manufacturing capacity to the extent required by
the growth of any of the markets we serve.

Metal
Beverage Packaging, Europe, Segment

Industry Background and
Ball’s Operations

The
European beverage can market is approximately 55 billion cans, or more than half
the size of the North American beverage can market. While current economic
conditions have slowed growth in the near term, the European market is expected
to grow, and is highly regional in terms of growth and packaging mix. Growth in
central and eastern Europe has been particularly strong in recent years but has
been impacted by the recent economic downturn, causing the company to delay
completion of its new plant in Lublin, Poland. Western markets, including the
United Kingdom and France continue to hold up on a relative
basis.

Page 3 of

Sales
volumes of metal beverage containers in Europe tend to be highest during the
period from May through August with a smaller increase in demand during the
winter holiday season for the United Kingdom. As in North America, the metal
beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by
the European beer and carbonated soft drink industries. The glass bottle is
heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry, while the PET container is
increasingly utilized in the carbonated soft drink, juice and mineral water
industries.

Ball
Packaging Europe is the second largest metal beverage container producer in
Europe, with an estimated 29 percent of European shipments, and supplies
two-piece beverage cans and can ends for producers of beer, carbonated soft
drinks, mineral water, fruit juices, energy drinks and other
beverages.

The metal
beverage packaging, Europe, segment, which accounted for 25 percent of Ball’s
consolidated net sales in 2008, consists of 10 beverage can plants and two
beverage can end plants in Europe. Of the 12 European plants, four are
located in Germany, three in the United Kingdom, two in France and one each in
the Netherlands, Poland and Serbia. In addition Ball Packaging Europe is
currently renting additional space on the premises of a supplier in Haslach,
Germany in order to produce the Ball Resealable End (BRE). The European plants
produced approximately 16 billion cans in 2008, with approximately
56 percent of those being produced from aluminum and 44 percent from steel.
Six of the can plants use aluminum and four use steel.

Ball
announced plans in January 2008 to build a new beverage can manufacturing plant
in Poland in order to meet the rapidly growing demand for beverage cans there
and elsewhere in central and eastern Europe. The plant is being built in Lublin,
which is in eastern Poland near the borders of Belarus and Ukraine. It will
initially have one production line with an annual capacity of approximately 750
million cans per year. However, due to the recent global economic downturn, we
will delay the completion of the plant until market conditions warrant such
startup. In addition we are delaying construction of our planned beverage can
plant in India due to current economic conditions in that country.

European
raw material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year, although
Ball Packaging Europe has negotiated some longer term agreements. In Europe
three steel suppliers and four aluminum suppliers provide approximately 95
percent of our requirements. Aluminum is purchased primarily in U.S. dollars,
while the functional currencies of Ball Packaging Europe and its subsidiaries
are non-U.S. dollars. The company generally tries to minimize the resulting
foreign exchange rate risk through the use of derivative contracts. In addition
purchase and sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass-through
pricing arrangements.

Metal
Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas, Segment

Industry Background and
Ball’s Operations

The metal
food and household products packaging, Americas, segment competes primarily in
the steel tinplate food and aerosol can markets in North America. The steel
tinplate food can market consists of approximately 31 billion cans annually, of
which about 43 percent are three-piece cans and 57 percent are two-piece cans.
The steel tinplate aerosol can market is approximately 3.2 billion cans
annually. We anticipate slight growth in the aerosol market, while the food
market is expected to be essentially flat over time.

Sales
volumes of metal food containers in North America tend to be highest from May
through October as a result of seasonal fruit, vegetable and salmon packs. We
estimate our 2008 shipments of more than 5.6 billion steel food containers to be
approximately 19 percent of total U.S. and Canadian metal food container
shipments. We estimate our aerosol business accounts for approximately 50
percent of total annual U.S. and Canadian steel aerosol shipments.

Competitors
in the metal food container product line include two national and a small number
of regional suppliers and self manufacturers. Several producers in Mexico also
manufacture steel food containers. Competition in the U.S. steel aerosol can
market primarily includes two national suppliers. Steel containers also compete
with other packaging materials in the food and household products industry
including glass, aluminum, plastic, paper and the stand-up pouch. As a result,
demand for this product line is dependent on product innovation and cost
reduction. Service, quality and price are among the other key competitive
factors. In North America, two steel suppliers provide more than 70 percent
of our tinplate steel. Some steel suppliers have experienced significant
financial and liquidity constraints in recent years, which may be exacerbated by
the global economic crisis. We believe we have limited our exposure related to
changes in the costs of steel tinplate as a result of the inclusion of
provisions in

Page 4 of

certain
steel container sales contracts to pass through steel cost changes and the
existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate
annually negotiated metal costs. In 2008 we were able to pass through the
majority of steel cost increases levied by producers.

The metal
food and household products packaging, Americas, segment accounted for
16 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008. The two major product lines
in this segment are steel food and aerosol containers. Ball produces two-piece
and three-piece steel food containers and ends for packaging vegetables, fruit,
soups, meat, seafood, nutritional products, pet food and other products. These
containers and ends are manufactured in nine plants in the U.S. and Canada and
sold primarily to food processors in North America.

The
segment also manufactures and sells aerosol cans, paint cans and custom and
specialty containers in eight plants in the U.S. and is the largest
manufacturer of aerosol cans in North America. In addition the company
manufactures and sells aerosol cans in two plants in Argentina.

In
October 2007, as part of a restructuring of Ball’s metal food and household
products packaging, Americas, segment, Ball announced plans to close aerosol
container manufacturing plants in Tallapoosa, Georgia, and Commerce, California.
Ball closed the Commerce facility during the third quarter of 2008 and closed
the Tallapoosa facility in January 2009. The two plant closures result in a net
reduction in manufacturing capacity of 10 production lines, including the
relocation of two high-speed aerosol lines into existing Ball facilities, and
allow us to supply customers from a consolidated asset base. These actions are
expected to yield annual pretax cost savings in excess of $15 million in
2009 and improve aerosol plant manufacturing utilization to more than
85 percent from about 70 percent.

Also in
October 2007, Ball announced its intention to exit the custom and decorative
tinplate can business based in its Baltimore, Maryland, manufacturing plant.
During 2008 it was determined, based on market conditions that we would remain
in that business.

Plastic
Packaging, Americas, Segment

Industry Background and
Ball’s Operations

Demand
for containers made of PET and polypropylene has slowed in the beverage and food
markets due to current economic conditions. While PET and polypropylene beverage
containers compete against metal, glass and cardboard, the historical increase
in the sales of PET containers has come primarily at the expense of glass
containers and through new market introductions.

Competition
in the PET plastic container industry is intense and includes several national
and regional suppliers and self manufacturers. In the smaller polypropylene
container industry, Ball is one of three major competitors. Service, quality and
price are important competitive factors with price being by far the most
important, resulting in poor margins for most of the industry. The ability to
produce customized, differentiated plastic containers is also a key competitive
factor. We believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs
of plastic resin as a result of the inclusion of provisions in substantially all
plastic container sales contracts to pass through resin cost
changes.

Plastic
packaging, Americas, accounted for 9 percent of Ball’s consolidated net
sales in 2008. We estimate our 2008 shipments of 5.5 billion plastic
bottles to be approximately 10 percent of total U.S. PET container shipments. In
addition this segment shipped approximately 750 million polypropylene food
and specialty containers during 2008. The company operates eight plastic
container manufacturing facilities in the U.S.

Most of
Ball’s PET containers are sold under long-term contracts to suppliers of bottled
water and carbonated soft drinks, including bottlers of Pepsi-Cola branded
beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups. Most
of our polypropylene containers are also sold under long-term contracts,
primarily to food packaging companies. Plastic beer containers are being
produced for several of our customers, and we are manufacturing plastic
containers for the single-serve juice and wine markets. Our line of Heat-Tek®
PET plastic bottles for hot-filled beverages, such as sports drinks and juices,
includes sizes from 8 ounces to 64 ounces.

Page 5 of

Ball’s
emphasis in this segment is on customized, differentiated containers. This
includes unique barrier plastics such as Gamma®, Gamma-Clear®, AmazonHM® and KHS
Corpoplast GmbH Plasmax® barrier bottles. The company is not investing in the
carbonated soft drink and bottled water business, which is a commodity business,
where return on investment has been unacceptable.

On June
26, 2008, Ball announced the closure of a plastic packaging manufacturing plant
in Brampton, Ontario, which ceased operations in the third quarter of 2008. The
Brampton operations have been consolidated into the company’s other plastic
packaging manufacturing facilities in the United States, and the closure of this
facility is expected to result in annual, fixed-cost savings of approximately $4
million beginning in 2009.

Aerospace
and Technologies Segment

Ball’s
aerospace and technologies segment, which accounted for 10 percent of
consolidated net sales in 2008, includes national defense, antenna and video
technologies, civil and operational space and systems engineering solutions
businesses. The segment develops spacecraft, sensors and instruments, radio
frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil, commercial and
national security aerospace markets. The majority of the aerospace and
technologies business involves work under contracts, generally from one to five
years in duration, as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the U.S. Department of Defense
(DoD) and other U.S. government agencies. Contracts funded by the various
agencies of the federal government represented 91 percent of segment sales in
2008.

Geopolitical
events, shifting executive and legislative branch priorities, funding shortfalls
combined with increased competition for new business have resulted in a decline
in opportunities in areas matching Ball’s aerospace and technologies segment’s
core capabilities in space hardware. Although we have seen declines in our space
hardware opportunities, our traditional strength, we have seen growth in
opportunities related to our services and tactical components. The businesses
include hardware, software and services sold primarily to U.S. customers, with
emphasis on space science and exploration, environmental and Earth sciences, and
defense and intelligence applications. Major contractual activities frequently
involve the design, manufacture and testing of satellites, remote sensors and
ground station control hardware and software, as well as related services such
as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations.

Other
hardware activities include target identification, warning and attitude control
systems and components; cryogenic systems for reactant storage, and sensor
cooling devices using either closed-cycle mechanical refrigerators or open-cycle
solid and liquid cryogens; star trackers, which are general-purpose stellar
attitude sensors; and fast-steering mirrors. Additionally, the aerospace and
technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to
government agencies, prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad
range of information warfare, electronic warfare, avionics, intelligence,
training and space systems needs.

Backlog
in the aerospace and technologies segment was $597 million and
$774 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and consists
of the aggregate contract value of firm orders, excluding amounts previously
recognized as revenue. The 2008 backlog includes $378 million expected
to be recognized in revenues during 2009, with the remainder expected to be
recognized in revenues thereafter. Unfunded amounts included in backlog for
certain firm government orders, which are subject to annual funding, were
$309 million and $463 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. Year-to-year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative
of the trend of future operations.

On
February 15, 2008, the segment completed the sale of its shares in Ball
Solutions Group Pty Ltd (BSG) to QinetiQ Pty Ltd for approximately $10.5
million, including cash sold of $1.8 million.  BSG was previously a
wholly owned Australian subsidiary that provided services to the Australian
department of defense and related government agencies. After an adjustment for
working capital items, the sale resulted in a pretax gain of $7.1
million.

Ball’s
aerospace and technologies segment has contracts with the U.S. government or its
contractors that have standard termination provisions. The government retains
the right to terminate contracts at its convenience. However, if contracts are
terminated in this manner, Ball is entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs
and profits on authorized work performed through the date of termination. U.S.
government contracts are also subject to reduction or modification in the event
of changes in government requirements or budgetary constraints.

Patents

In the
opinion of the company, none of its active patents is essential to the
successful operation of its business as a whole.

Research
and Development

Research
and development (R&D) efforts in the North American packaging segments, as
well as in the European metal beverage container business, are primarily
directed toward packaging innovation, specifically the development of new sizes
and types of containers, as well as new uses for the current containers. Other
R&D efforts in these segments seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies.
Our North American packaging R&D activities are primarily conducted in the
Ball Technology & Innovation Center (BTIC) located in Westminster, Colorado.
The European R&D activities are primarily conducted in a technical center
located in Bonn, Germany.

In our
aerospace business, we continue to focus our R&D activities on the design,
development and manufacture of innovative aerospace systems. This includes the
production of spacecraft, instruments and sensors, radio frequency and microwave
technologies, data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace
technologies and products that enable deep space missions. Our aerospace R&D
activities are conducted in various locations in the U.S.

Note 23,
"Research and Development," in the consolidated financial statements within Item
8 of this report, contains information on company research and development
activity. Additional information is also included in Item 2,
“Properties.”

Sustainability
and the Environment

Throughout
our company’s history, we have focused on sustainability and the environment in
all aspects of our businesses and recently have formalized our initiatives in
light of the current environment. We continue to make progress on the
sustainability goals stated in the sustainability report we issued on June 30,
2008. We have committed to formally report on the status of our sustainability
efforts in 2010.

Key
issues for our company include reducing our use of electricity and natural gas,
reducing waste and increasing recycling at our facilities, analyzing and
reducing our water consumption, reducing our existing volatile organic compounds
and further improving safety performance in our facilities.

The 2007
recycling rate in the United States for aluminum cans was 54 percent, the
highest recycling rate for any beverage container. According to the most
recently published data, the aluminum can sheet we buy contains an average of
41 percent post consumer recycled content and approximately 9 percent
post industrial content, reducing the amount of virgin material to
50 percent.

Recycling
rates vary throughout Europe but average around 60 percent for aluminum and
steel containers, which exceeds the European Union’s goal of 50 percent
recycling for metals. Due in part to the intrinsic value of aluminum and steel,
metal packaging recycling rates in Europe compare favorably to those of other
packaging materials. Ball’s European operations help establish and financially
support recycling initiatives in growing markets, such as Poland and Serbia, to
educate consumers about the benefits of recycling aluminum and steel cans and to
increase recycling rates. We have also initiated a similar program in China to
educate consumers in that market regarding the benefits of
recycling.

Compliance
with federal, state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has
not had a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or
competitive position of the company. As more fully described under Item 3,
“Legal Proceedings,” the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and various state
environmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible
party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous
waste sites. However, the company’s information at this time indicates that
these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity,
results of operations or financial condition of the company.

Legislation
that would prohibit, tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of
containers, or would require diversion of solid wastes, including packaging
materials, from disposal in landfills, has been or may be introduced anywhere we
operate. While container legislation has been adopted in some jurisdictions,
similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies
in numerous others. The company anticipates that continuing efforts will be made
to consider and adopt such legislation in many jurisdictions in the future. If
such legislation were widely adopted, it could potentially have a material
adverse effect on the business of the company, including its liquidity, results
of operations or financial condition, as well as on the container manufacturing
industry generally, in view of the company’s substantial global sales and
investment in metal and PET container manufacturing. However, the packages we
produce are widely used and perform well in U.S. states, Canadian provinces and
European countries that have deposit systems.

Employee
Relations

At the
end of 2008, the company employed approximately 10,400 employees in the
U.S. and 4,100 in other countries. An additional 1,000 people were
employed in unconsolidated joint ventures in which Ball
participates.

Approximately
30 percent of Ball's North American packaging plant employees are unionized and
most of our European plant employees are union workers. Collective bargaining
agreements with various unions in the U.S. have terms of three to five years and
those in Europe have terms of one to two years. The agreements expire at regular
intervals and are customarily renewed in the ordinary course after bargaining
between union and company representatives. The company believes that its
employee relations are good and that its safety, training, education and
retention practices assist in enhancing employee satisfaction
levels.

Item
1A.   Risk Factors

Any of
the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations.

The
loss of a key customer, or a reduction in its requirements, could have a
significant negative impact on our sales.

While we
have diversified our customer base, we do sell a majority of our packaging
products to relatively few major beverage, packaged food and household product
companies, some of which operate in North America, South America, Europe and
Asia.

Although
approximately 65 percent of our customer contracts are long-term, these
contracts are terminable under certain circumstances, such as our failure to
meet quality or volume requirements. Because we depend on relatively few major
customers, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be
adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers, a reduction in the
purchasing levels of these customers, a strike or work stoppage by a significant
number of these customers' employees or an adverse change in the terms of the
supply agreements with these customers.

The
primary customers for our aerospace segment are U.S. government agencies or
their prime contractors. These sales represented approximately 9 percent of
Ball's consolidated 2008 net sales. Our contracts with these customers are
subject to several risks, including funding cuts and delays, technical
uncertainties, budget changes, competitive activity and changes in
scope.

We
face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our
profitability.

Competition
within the packaging industry is intense. Increases in productivity, combined
with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry, have maintained
competitive pricing pressures. The principal methods of competition in the
general packaging industry are price, service and quality. Some of our
competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Our
current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products
that are deemed superior to ours. The current global economic crisis may result
in reductions in demand for our products, which, in turn, could increase these
competitive pressures.

We
are subject to competition from alternative products, which could result in
lower profits and reduced cash flows.

Our metal
packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute
products, particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from PET,
single serve beer bottles and other food and beverage containers made of glass,
cardboard or other materials. Competition from plastic carbonated soft drink
bottles is particularly intense in the United States and the United Kingdom.
Certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from
alternative solutions. There can be no assurance that our products will
successfully compete against alternative products, which could result in a
reduction in our profits or cash flow.

We
have a narrow product range, and our business would suffer if usage of our
products decreased.

For the
12 months ended December 31, 2008, 65 percent of our consolidated net
sales were from the sale of metal beverage cans, and we expect to derive a
significant portion of our future revenues from the sale of metal beverage cans.
Our business would suffer if the use of metal beverage cans decreased.
Accordingly, broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel cans for a wide
variety of beverages is critical to our future success. If demand for glass and
PET bottles increases relative to cans, or the demand for aluminum and steel
cans does not develop as expected, our business, financial condition or results
of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Page 9 of

Our
business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks
resulting from increased international operations.

We
derived 31 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the U.S.
for the year ended December 31, 2008. This sizeable scope of international
operations may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more
difficult for us to manage our business. Reasons for this include, but are not
limited to, the following:

●

political
      and economic instability in foreign
markets;

●

foreign
      governments' restrictive trade
policies;

●

the
      imposition of duties, taxes or government
  royalties;

●

foreign
      exchange rate risks;

●

difficulties
      in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property
      rights; and

●

the
      geographic, language and cultural differences between personnel in
      different areas of the world.

Any of
these factors, some of which are also present in the U.S., could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

We
are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.

For the
12 months ended December 31, 2008, 73 percent of our consolidated net
sales were attributable to operations with the U.S. dollar as their functional
currency, 15 percent with the euro as the functional currency and
12 percent were attributable to operations having functional currencies
other than the U.S. dollar or the euro.

Our
reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Historically, Ball's foreign operations,
including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses, have been
denominated in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we expect that
our foreign operations will continue to be so denominated. As a result, the U.S.
dollar value of Ball's foreign operations has varied, and will continue to vary,
with exchange rate fluctuations. Ball has been, and is presently, primarily
exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro, British pound,
Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real, Argentine peso
and Serbian dinar.

A
decrease in the value of any of these currencies, especially the euro, British
pound, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi and Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S.
dollar, could reduce our profits from foreign operations and the value of the
net assets of our foreign operations when reported in U.S. dollars in our
financial statements. This could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations as reported in U.S. dollars. In
addition fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings
are generated may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons
of our reported results of operations.

We
actively manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, particularly our
exposure to fluctuations in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate, in order to
attempt to mitigate the effect of foreign cash flow and earnings volatility
associated with foreign exchange rate changes. We primarily use forward
contracts and options to manage our foreign currency exposures and, as a result,
we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, by
the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities. Our
inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could
materially impact our results.

Our
business, operating results and financial condition are subject to particular
risks in certain regions of the world.

We may
experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more
periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results or financial condition. Moreover, overcapacity, which often leads to
lower prices, exists in a number of the regions in which we operate and may
persist even if demand grows. Our ability to manage such operational
fluctuations and to maintain adequate long-term strategies in the face of such
developments will be critical to our continued growth and
profitability.

If
we fail to retain key management and personnel, we may be unable to implement
our key objectives.

We
believe that our future success depends, in part, on our experienced management
team. Losing the services of key members of our management team could make it
difficult for us to manage our business and meet our
objectives.

Page 10
of 96

Decreases
in our ability to apply new technology and know-how may affect our
competitiveness.

Our
success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and
services. We must also introduce new products and services to meet changing
customer needs. If we are unable to implement better production processes or to
develop new products, we may not be able to remain competitive with other
manufacturers. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of
operations could be adversely affected.

Bad
weather and climate changes may result in lower sales.

We
manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods. Unseasonably
cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers.
In addition poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop
yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food
containers. The effects of global warming on climate could have various effects
on the demand for our products in different regions around the
world.

We
are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw
materials.

We
purchase aluminum, steel, plastic resin and other raw materials and packaging
supplies from several sources. While all such materials are available from
independent suppliers, raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price
attributable to a number of factors, including general economic conditions,
commodity price fluctuations (particularly aluminum on the London Metal
Exchange), the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the
availability of complementary and substitute materials. Although we enter into
commodities purchase agreements from time to time and use derivative instruments
to manage our risk, we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials
will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices.
Economic and financial factors could impact our suppliers, thereby causing
supply shortages. Increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Because
our North American contracts often pass raw material costs directly on to the
customer, increasing raw material costs may not impact our near-term
profitability but could decrease our sales volumes over time. In Europe, some
contracts do not allow us to pass on increased raw material costs and we
regularly use derivative agreements to manage this risk. Our hedging procedures
may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of
materials increase.

Prolonged
work stoppages at plants with union employees could jeopardize our financial
position.

As of
December 31, 2008, approximately 30 percent of our employees in North America
and most of our employees in Europe were covered by one or more collective
bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements have staggered
expirations during the next several years. Although we consider our employee
relations to be generally good, a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any
facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition we cannot
ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements,
new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new
agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us. Potential legislation has been
discussed in the United States, which may, if enacted, facilitate the ability of
unions to unionize workers and to establish collective bargaining agreements
with employers, including the company.

Our
aerospace and technologies segment is subject to certain risks specific to that
business including those outlined below.

In
our aerospace business, existing U.S. government contracts are subject to
continued appropriations by Congress and may be terminated or delayed if future
funding is not made available.

Our
backlog includes both cost-type and fixed-price contracts. Cost-type contracts
generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and
margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken, the
nature of the work performed under those contracts, the costs incurred in
performing the work, the achievement of other performance objectives and their
impact on our ability to receive fees.

Our
business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance
costs.

Our
operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating
to environmental hazards, such as emissions to air, discharges to water, the
handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of

hazardous substances. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has
designated us, along with numerous other

Page 11
of 96

companies, as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of
several hazardous waste sites. Based on available information, we do not believe
that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, capital
expenditures or competitive position. The new U.S. executive administration
could bring renewed focus and attention to the regulation of greenhouse gas
emissions and other environmental issues.

There
can be no assurance that any acquired business, will be successfully integrated
into the acquiring company.

While we
have what we believe to be well designed integration plans, if we cannot
successfully integrate newly acquired businesses with those of Ball, we may
experience negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results
of operations. The integration of companies that have previously been operated
separately involves a number of risks, including difficulties in assimilating
and integrating new businesses, additional demands on management, expenses
related to undisclosed or potential liabilities, retention of major customers
and other risks.

If
we have a fair value impairment in a business segment, net earnings and net
worth could be materially adversely affected by a write down of
goodwill.

We have
$1,825.5 million of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as
of December 31, 2008.  We are required to periodically determine if
our goodwill has become impaired, in which case we would write down the impaired
portion of goodwill. If we were required to write down all or a significant part
of our goodwill, our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely
affected.

If
the investments in Ball's pension plans do not perform as expected, we may have
to contribute additional amounts to the plans, which would otherwise be
available to cover operating expenses.

Ball
maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its
North American and United Kingdom employees, which we fund based on certain
actuarial assumptions. The plans

’

assets consist
primarily of common stocks, fixed income securities and, in the U.S.,
alternative investments. Due to the significant fall in worldwide equity prices
during 2008, the company will increase contributions to the plans during 2009.
At this time the company estimates the additional U.S. pension plan contribution
to be within the range of $35 million to $40 million pretax; however, we are
monitoring legislative activity and equity markets to determine the final amount
we will contribute to ensure that the plans will be able to pay out benefits as
scheduled. Further equity market declines, longevity increases or legislative
changes could result in a decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings,
and the recognition of such an increase could result in a reduction to our
shareholders' equity.

Restricted access to capital markets
could adversely affect o

ur

short-term liquidity and prevent us
from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond
indentures.

On
December 31, 2008, we had total debt of $2,410.1 million and unused
committed credit lines in excess of $500 million. Our ratio of earnings to fixed
charges as of that date was 3.7 times (see Exhibit 12 attached to this
Annual Report). A reduction of financial liquidity could have important
consequences, including the following:

●

reduce
      our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and
      development expenditures and other business
  activities;

●

increase
      our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions,
      including the credit risks stemming from the current global credit
      crisis;

●

limit
      our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses
      and the industries in which we
operate;

●

restrict
      us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business
      opportunities; and

●

limit,
      along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt,
      among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of
      assets, pay cash dividends or refinance debt
  maturities.

In
addition approximately 60 percent of our debt bears interest at variable rates.
If market interest rates increase, variable-rate debt will create higher debt
service requirements, which would adversely affect our cash flow. While we
sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure, any such agreements may
not offer complete protection from this risk.

Page 12
of 96

The
current global credit, financial and economic crisis could have a negative
impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash
flows.

The
current global credit, financial and economic crisis could have significant
negative effects on our operations, including, but not limited to, the
following:

●

the
      creditworthiness of customers, suppliers and counterparties could
      deteriorate resulting in a financial loss or a disruption in our supply of
      raw materials;

●

the
      recent downward trend of market performance could affect the fair value of
      our pension assets, potentially requiring us to make significant
      additional contributions to our defined benefit plans to maintain
      prescribed funding levels;

●

a significant
      weakening of our financial position or operating results could result in
      noncompliance with our debt covenants;
and

●

reduced
      cash flow from our operations could adversely affect our ability to
      execute our long-term strategy to increase liquidity, reduce debt,
      repurchase our stock and invest in our
  businesses.

We
are subject to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), under
which we are often required to make changes in our accounting and reported
results.

U.S. GAAP
changes are routine and have become more frequent and significant over the past
few years. These changes can have significant effects on our reported results
when compared to prior periods and may even require us to retrospectively adjust
prior periods. In the application of U.S. GAAP, management is required to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingencies and reported amounts of revenues and
expenses. These estimates are based on historical experience and various other
assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results
could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The
proposed steps to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards in the U.S.
could exacerbate these risks.

2.   Properties

The
company’s properties described below are well maintained, are considered
adequate and are being utilized for their intended purposes.

Ball’s
corporate headquarters and the aerospace and technologies segment offices are
located in Broomfield, Colorado. The Colorado-based operations of the aerospace
and technologies segment occupy a variety of company-owned and leased
facilities in Broomfield, Boulder and Westminster, which together aggregate
1.3 million square feet of office, laboratory, research and
development, engineering and test and manufacturing space. Other aerospace and
technologies operations carry on business in smaller company-owned and leased
facilities in Georgia, New Mexico, Ohio, Virginia and Washington,
D.C.

The
offices of the company’s North American packaging operations are located in
Westminster, Colorado, and the offices for the European packaging operations are
located in Ratingen, Germany. Also located in Westminster is the Ball Technology
and Innovation Center, which serves as a research and development facility for
the North American metal packaging and plastic container operations. The
European Technical Center, which serves as a research and development facility
for the European beverage can manufacturing operations, is located in Bonn,
Germany.

Information
regarding the approximate size of the manufacturing locations for significant
packaging operations, which are owned or leased by the company, is set forth
below. Facilities in the process of being shut down have been excluded from the
list. Where certain locations include multiple facilities, the total approximate
size for the location is noted. In addition to the facilities listed, the
company leases other warehousing space.

Item
3.   Legal Proceedings

As
previously reported, the company is investigating potential violations of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in Argentina, which came to our attention on or
about October 15, 2007. The Department of Justice and the SEC were also
made aware of this matter, on or about the same date. Based on our investigation
to date, we do not believe this matter involved senior management or management
or other employees who have significant roles in internal control over financial
reporting.

As
previously reported, on October 6, 2005, Ball Metal Beverage Container
Corp. (BMBCC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, was served with an
amended complaint filed by Crown Packaging Technology, Inc. et. al.
(Crown), in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western
Division at Dayton, Ohio. The complaint alleges that the manufacture, sale and
use of certain ends by BMBCC and its customers infringes certain claims of
Crown’s U.S. patents. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, fees,
and declaratory and injunctive relief. BMBCC has formally denied the allegations
of the complaint. A Markman order construing the claim terms has been issued in
this case and motions for summary judgment have been filed by both parties. A
trial has been tentatively set to begin in May 2009. Based on the information
available to the company at the present time, the company does not believe that
this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of
operations or financial condition of the company.

As
previously reported, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) considers
the company a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) with respect to the Lowry
Landfill site located east of Denver, Colorado. On June 12, 1992, the
company was served with a lawsuit filed by the City and County of Denver
(Denver) and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc., seeking contributions from the
company and approximately 38 other companies. The company filed its answer
denying the allegations of the complaint. On July 8, 1992, the company was
served with a third-party complaint filed by S.W. Shattuck Chemical Company,
Inc., seeking contribution from the company and other companies for the costs
associated with cleaning up the Lowry Landfill. The company denied the
allegations of the complaints.

In July
1992 the company entered into a settlement and indemnification agreement with
Chemical Waste Management, Inc., and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc.
(collectively Waste Management) and Denver pursuant to which Waste Management
and Denver dismissed their lawsuit against the company, and Waste Management
agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the company from claims and
lawsuits brought by governmental agencies and other parties relating to actions
seeking contributions or remedial costs from the company for the cleanup of the
site. Waste Management, Inc., has agreed to guarantee the obligations for Waste
Management. Waste Management and Denver may seek additional payments from the
company if the response costs related to the site exceed $319 million. In
2003 Waste Management, Inc., indicated that the cost of the site might exceed
$319 million in 2030, approximately three years before the projected
completion of the project. The company might also be responsible for payments
(based on 1992 dollars) for any additional wastes that may have been disposed of
by the company at the site but which are identified after the execution of the
settlement agreement. While remediating the site, contaminants were encountered,
which could add an additional cleanup cost of approximately $10 million.
This additional cleanup cost could, in turn, add approximately $1 million
to total site costs for the PRP group.

At this
time, there are no Lowry Landfill actions in which the company is actively
involved. Based on the information available to the company at this time, the
company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect
upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the
company.

As
previously reported, the USEPA has sent notice of potential liability to Ball
and other PRPs with respect to four parcels at the Rocky Flats Industrial Park
site, and other adjacent sites, located in Jefferson County, Colorado, as well
as with respect to the Solvents Recovery of New England site located in
Southington, Connecticut. Based on the information available to the company at
the present time, the company believes that these matters will not have a
material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial
condition of the company.

On
December 30, 2002, the company received a letter from the USEPA pursuant to
the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)
requesting answers to certain questions regarding the waste disposal practices
of Heekin Can Company, which the company acquired in 1993, and the relationship
between the company and Heekin Can Company. Region 5 of the USEPA is involved in
the cleanup

Page 16
of 96

of the
Jackson Brothers Paint Company site, which consists of four, and possibly five,
sites in and around Laurel, Indiana. The Jackson Brothers Paint Company
apparently disposed of drums of waste in those sites during the 1960s and 1970s.
The USEPA has alleged that some of the waste that has been uncovered was sent to
the sites from the Cincinnati plant operated by Heekin Can Company. The Indiana
Department of Environmental Management referred this matter to the USEPA for
removal of the drums and cleanup. At the present time, there are an undetermined
number of drums at one or more of the sites that have been initially identified
by the USEPA as originating from Heekin Can Company. The USEPA has sent letters
to seven PRPs including Heekin Can Company. On January 30, 2003, the
company responded to the USEPA’s requests for information pursuant to
Section 104(e) of CERCLA. The USEPA has initially estimated cleanup costs
to be between $4 million and $5 million. Based on the information
available to the company at the present time, the company does not believe that
this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of
operations or financial condition of the company.

Item
7.   Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

Management’s
discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Ball Corporation and its
subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “Ball” or “the company” or “we” or
“our” in the following discussion and analysis.

BUSINESS
OVERVIEW

Ball
Corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal and plastic
packaging to the beverage, food and household products industries. Our packaging
products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured
in plants around the world. We also supply aerospace and other technologies
and services to governmental and commercial customers.

We sell
our packaging products primarily to major beverage, food and household products
companies with which we have developed long-term customer relationships. This is
evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long-term
supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a majority
of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in North America,
Europe, the People

’

s Republic of
China (PRC) and Argentina, as do our equity joint ventures in Brazil, the U.S.
and the PRC. We also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers.
Because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of a
major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major
customer or supplier, although our contracts and long-term relationships help us
to mitigate those risks in the majority of circumstances.

In the
rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs,
increasing prices, developing new products and expanding volume. Over the past
two years, we have closed several packaging facilities in support of our ongoing
objective of matching our supply with market demand. We have also identified and
implemented plans to improve our return on invested capital through the
redeployment of assets within our worldwide beverage can business.

While the
North American beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature,
the European, PRC and Brazilian beverage can markets are growing and are
expected to continue to grow in the medium to long-term. While we are able to
capitalize on this growth by increasing capacity in some of our European can
manufacturing facilities by speeding up certain lines and by expansion, we have
put on hold various projects, including the completion of the construction of
the Poland plant and new construction in India, due to the current world-wide
economic environment. We are proceeding with the recently announced new one-line
metal beverage can plant in our Brazil joint venture and are adding further can
capacity in the existing Brazilian can plant. These Brazilian expansion efforts
will be owned by Ball’s unconsolidated 50-percent-owned joint venture,
Latapack-Ball Embalagens, Ltda., and the expansion is being funded by cash flows
from operations and incurrence of debt by the joint venture.

As part
of our packaging strategy, we are focused on developing and marketing new and
existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate
consumer. These innovations include new shapes, sizes, opening features and
other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging. This packaging
development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with
major beverage, food and household products customers. As part of this focus, we
installed a new aluminum bottle line, as well as a 24-ounce beverage can
production line in our Monticello, Indiana, facility, both of which became
operational during the third quarter of 2008.

Ball’s
consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and we
attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial
instruments, as discussed in “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk” within Item 7A of this report.

Page 20
of 96

The
primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and
technologies segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors. It
is possible that federal budget reductions and priorities, or changes in agency
budgets, could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong
contract performance. We expect that the delay of certain program awards, as
well as federal budget considerations under the new administration, will have an
unfavorable impact on this segment in 2009, and we are taking steps to adjust
our resources accordingly.

We
recognize sales under long-term contracts in the aerospace and technologies
segment using the cost-to-cost, percentage of completion method of accounting.
Our present contract mix consists of approximately two-thirds percent cost-type
contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and/or earned
profit component, while the remainder are fixed-price contracts. We include
time and material contracts in the fixed-price category because such contracts
typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates.
Failure to be awarded certain key contracts could further adversely affect
segment performance during 2009 compared to 2008.

Throughout
the period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary,
revise our estimates of BATC’s total contract revenue, total contract cost and
progress toward completion. Because of contract payment schedules, limitations
on funding and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this
segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.

Management
uses various measures to evaluate company performance. The primary financial
metric we use is economic value added (tax-effected operating earnings, as
defined by the company, less a charge for net operating assets employed). Our
goal is to increase economic value added on an annual basis. Other financial
metrics we use are earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT); earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); diluted earnings per
share; operating cash flow and free cash flow (generally defined by the company
as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures). These
financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability
between periods. Nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include
production efficiency and spoilage rates; quality control figures;
environmental, health and safety statistics and production and sales volumes.
Additional measures used to evaluate performance in the aerospace and
technologies segment include contract revenue realization, award and incentive
fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog (including awarded, contracted and
funded backlog).

We
recognize that attracting, developing and retaining highly talented employees
are essential to the success of Ball and, because of this, we strive to pay
employees competitively and encourage their ownership of the company’s common
stock as part of a diversified portfolio. For most management employees, a
meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive, dependent upon
economic value-added operating performance. For more senior positions, more
compensation is at risk through economic value-added performance and various
stock compensation plans. Through our employee stock purchase plan and 401(k)
plan, which matches employee contributions with Ball common stock, employees,
regardless of organizational level, have opportunities to own Ball
stock.

CONSOLIDATED
SALES AND EARNINGS

The
company has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product
lines, after aggregating operating segments that have similar economic
characteristics: (1) metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia;
(2) metal beverage packaging, Europe; (3) metal food and household
products packaging, Americas; (4) plastic packaging, Americas; and
(5) aerospace and technologies. We also have investments in companies in
the U.S., the PRC and Brazil, which are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or
earnings.

Due to
first quarter 2008 management reporting changes, Ball’s operations in the PRC
with 2008 net sales of $289.6 million are now aggregated and included in
the metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment (previously included
within the company’s European operations). Also, effective January 1, 2007,
a plastic pail product line with 2007 net sales of $52.1 million was
transferred from the metal food and household products packaging, Americas,
segment to the plastic packaging, Americas, segment. Prior periods have been
retrospectively adjusted to the current presentation.

Metal
Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia

The metal
beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment consists of operations located in
the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico (through fiscal year 2008) and the PRC, which
manufacture metal container products used in beverage packaging as well as
non-beverage plastic containers manufactured and sold mainly in the
PRC.

This
segment accounted for 40 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008
(41 percent in 2007, including the impact from the $85.6 million legal
settlement with Miller discussed below, and 42 percent in 2006). Excluding
the effect of the legal settlement, sales were 4 percent lower in 2008 than
in 2007, primarily as a result of 2008 decreases in North American sales volumes
of approximately 5 percent. The decrease in North American sales volumes was due
primarily to lower unit volume sales to carbonated soft drink customers,
consistent with the industry, and lost beer sales volumes on discontinuance of a
contract that did not provide sufficient profitability. This decrease was
somewhat offset by sales volume increases in the PRC of 14 percent during 2008.
Sales were 10 percent higher in 2007 than in 2006 (7 percent higher
including the effect from the legal settlement) with flat volumes being offset
by higher sales prices, which were primarily due to rising aluminum prices and
the pass through of various cost increases to customers. Based on publicly
available information, we estimate that our shipments of metal beverage
containers were approximately 30 percent of total U.S. and Canadian
shipments and 22 percent of total PRC shipments in 2008. We continue to focus
efforts on the growing custom beverage can business, which includes cans of
different shapes, diameters and fill volumes, and cans with added functional
attributes for new products and product line extensions.

During
the second quarter of 2007, Miller asserted various claims against a wholly
owned subsidiary of the company, primarily related to the pricing of the
aluminum component of the containers supplied by the subsidiary, and on October
4, 2007, the dispute was settled in mediation. Miller received $85.6 million
($51.8 million after tax) on settlement of the dispute, and Ball retained all of
Miller’s beverage can and end supply through 2015. Miller received a one-time
payment of $70.3 million ($42.5 million after tax) in January 2008
(recorded on the December 31, 2007, consolidated balance sheet in other
current liabilities) with the remainder of the settlement to be recovered over
the life of the supply contract, which extends through 2015. On July 1, 2008,
Miller’s business was combined with the U.S. business of Coors Brewing Company,
which we also supply, to form MillerCoors, LLC.

Segment
earnings in 2008 were $243.5 million ($284.1 million excluding business
consolidation costs discussed in more detail below) compared to
$240.8 million ($326.4 million excluding the legal settlement) in 2007 and
$285.8 million in 2006. Excluding the $40.6 million in business
consolidation charges in 2008 and $85.6 million settlement in 2007, earnings in
2008 were lower than in 2007 by 13 percent, primarily due to raw material
inventory gains of $52 million realized in 2007, which did not recur in 2008.
Earnings in 2008 were also negatively impacted by lower North American sales
volumes, which were partially offset by the higher sales volumes in the PRC.
Positive cost impacts from a new end technology project commenced in 2006 and
other cost optimization measures partially offset the prior year non-recurring
inventory gain and the unfavorable net sales volume decreases. The higher
segment earnings in 2007, before the legal settlement, compared to 2006 were due
to raw material inventory gains in 2007 that exceeded 2006 by approximately
$30 million. Also contributing were approximately $9 million of lower
manufacturing costs related to the new end technology project and improved
production efficiencies. These gains were offset by increased repair and
maintenance costs and higher labor and other conversion costs, a portion of
which could not be passed through to our customers.

On April
23, 2008, Ball announced that by the end of 2008 it would close a metal beverage
packaging plant in Kent, Washington, and in 2008 recorded pretax charges of $7.1
million ($4.3 million after tax), including the sale of the plant facility in
the fourth quarter. The closure of the Kent facility is expected to result in
net fixed costs savings of approximately $10 million in 2009. Also in the second
quarter of 2008, a gain of $7.2 million ($4.4 million after tax) was
recorded for the recovery of previously expensed pension, employee severance and
other benefit closure obligation costs no longer required. This reflects a
decision made in the second quarter to continue to operate existing end-making
equipment and not install a new beverage can end module that would have been
part of our multi-year project.

On
October 30, 2008, Ball announced the closure of two North American metal
beverage can plants. A plant in Kansas City, Missouri, which primarily
manufactures specialty beverage cans, will be closed by the end of the first
quarter 2009, with manufacturing volumes absorbed by other North American
beverage can plants. A plant in Puerto Rico, which manufactured 12-ounce
beverage cans, was closed at the end of 2008. A pretax charge
of

Page 22
of 96

approximately
$40.7 million ($25.2 million after tax) was recorded in the fourth quarter
of 2008 with an additional $5 million ($3 million after tax) expected in
2009. Cost reductions associated with these plant closings are expected to be up
to $30 million in 2009 and be $7 million cash positive upon final disposition of
the assets.

Metal
Beverage Packaging, Europe

The metal
beverage packaging, Europe, segment includes metal beverage packaging products
manufactured in Europe. Ball Packaging Europe, which represents an estimated
29 percent of total European metal beverage container manufacturing
capacity, has manufacturing plants located in Germany, the United Kingdom,
France, the Netherlands, Poland and Serbia, and is the second largest metal
beverage container business in Europe.

This
segment accounted for 25 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 (22
percent in 2007 and 20 percent in 2006). Segment sales in 2008 as compared
to 2007 were 13 percent higher due largely to approximately 8 percent higher
sales volume, consistent with overall market growth; higher sales prices and
foreign currency sales gains of 8 percent on the strength of the euro.
These positive impacts were offset by certain small unfavorable cost changes,
including product mix changes towards smaller containers. Segment sales in 2007
were 26 percent higher than in 2006, due primarily to over 9 percent
higher sales volume, higher sales prices and foreign currency sales gains of
9 percent on the strength of the euro. Higher segment volumes in both
periods were aided by the growth in Europe of specialty can volumes, including
the successful introduction of the Ball sleek can into Italy. The slow return of
the metal beverage can to the German market, following the mandatory deposit
legislation previously reported on, is being offset by stronger demand outside
Germany.

Segment
earnings were $230.9 million in 2008, $228.9 million in 2007 and
$252.3 million ($176.8 million excluding a $75.5 million property insurance
gain) in 2006. Earnings in 2008 were positively impacted by an increase in net
margins of $55 million due to the combined impact of the increased sales volumes
and price recovery initiatives, which exceeded the negative impact from product
mix, as well as approximately $20 million related to a stronger euro. These
improvements were partially offset by $36 million of higher other costs
including a negative foreign exchange impact from the conversion of the British
pound to the euro and $35.1 million for business interruption recoveries in 2007
that were not repeated in 2008 (for further details see below). Earnings in 2007
compared to 2006, excluding the $75.5 million property insurance gain
received in 2006 due to a fire at the company’s Hassloch, Germany, metal
beverage can plant (further details are provided below), were positively
impacted by an increase in net margins of $76 million due to the combined impact
of increased sales volumes and price recovery initiatives, $16 million from
cost control programs and $13 million related to a stronger euro. These
improvements were partially offset by $26 million of other higher costs and
$15.9 million of lower business interruption insurance recognition in
2007.

On
April 1, 2006, a fire in the metal beverage can plant in Hassloch, Germany,
damaged a significant portion of the building and machinery and equipment. The
property insurance proceeds recorded for the combined years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006, which were based on replacement cost, were
€86.3 million ($109.9 million). A
€26.7 million ($33.8 million) fixed asset write down was recorded
to reflect the estimated impairment of the assets damaged as a result of the
fire. As a result, a pretax gain of €59.6 million ($75.5 million) was
recorded in the 2006 consolidated statement of earnings to reflect the
difference between the net book value of the impaired assets and the property
insurance proceeds. An additional €27.2 million ($35.1 million) and
€40 million ($51 million) were recorded in cost of sales in 2007 and
2006, respectively, for insurance recoveries related to business interruption
costs, as well as €11.3 million ($14.3 million) in 2006 to offset
clean-up costs.

Metal
Food and Household Products Packaging, Americas

The metal
food and household products packaging, Americas, segment consists of operations
located in the U.S., Canada and Argentina. The company acquired U.S. Can
Corporation (U.S. Can) on March 27, 2006, and with that acquisition, added
to its metal food can business the production and sale of aerosol cans, paint
cans, plastic pails and decorative specialty cans. Effective January 1,
2007, responsibility for the plastic pail product line, with 2007 net sales of
$52.1 million, was transferred to the plastic packaging, Americas, segment.
Accordingly, 2006 segment amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect
the transfer.

Page 23
of 96

This
segment accounted for 16 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 (16
percent in 2007 and 17 percent in 2006). Segment sales in 2008 increased 3
percent as compared to 2007 mostly due to higher selling prices offset by an
approximate 3 percent decrease in sales volumes primarily as a result of
decisions by management to discontinue low margin business, which led to the
announced closure of our Commerce, California, and Tallapoosa, Georgia,
facilities in 2007. We estimate our 2008 shipments account for approximately 19
percent and 50 percent of total annual U.S. and Canadian steel food container
and steel aerosol container shipments, respectively. Segment sales in 2007
increased 4 percent as compared to 2006 due to an approximate 10 percent
increase in sales for the inclusion of a full year’s sales from the acquisition
of U.S. Can, partially offset by a 3 percent decline in sales from lost
business, as well as customer operating issues in food cans, including a fire in
a customer’s factory, and unfavorable weather conditions in the
Midwest.

Segment
earnings were $69.7

million ($68.1 million
excluding a $1.6 million gain from business consolidation activities) in 2008,
compared to a loss of $8 million (earnings of $36.2 million excluding
business consolidation costs of $44.2 million) in 2007 and earnings of
$2.4 million ($37.9 million excluding business consolidation costs of $35.5
million) in 2006. Excluding the business consolidation activities for each
period, earnings in 2008 exceeded 2007 by approximately 88 percent primarily
related to improved pricing, better manufacturing performance and the settlement
of a claim in the amount of almost $7 million offset by the negative impact of 3
percent lower sales volumes in 2008. The 4 percent lower earnings in 2007
compared to 2006, excluding the business consolidation charges, were primarily
related to increased steel and coating material costs, partially offset by
improved manufacturing performance in 2007 and higher cost of sales in the
second quarter of 2006 related to $6.1 million of purchase accounting
adjustments for inventory valuations associated with the acquired U.S. Can
finished goods inventory. While pricing pressures continue on all of our raw
materials, other direct materials and freight and utility costs, we continue to
seek price increases in the market place.

In
October 2007, Ball announced plans to close aerosol manufacturing plants in
Tallapoosa, Georgia, and Commerce, California, and announced its intent to exit
the custom and decorative tinplate can business located in Baltimore, Maryland.
A pretax charge of $44.2 million ($26.8 million after tax) was
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007 primarily related to these closures. Ball
incurred additional net pretax charges of $3.5 million primarily related to
lease cancellation costs for the closure of the Commerce facility during 2008.
Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2008, it was determined, based on
market conditions that we would remain in the custom and decorative tinplate can
business, which resulted in the reversal of $5.4 million in business
consolidation charges previously recorded. We closed the Tallapoosa facility
early in the first quarter of 2009 and do not anticipate further charges related
to this closure. When completed in 2009, the actions are expected to yield
annualized pretax cost savings in excess of $15 million and improve the
aerosol plant utilization rate to more than 85 percent from about
70 percent. The cash costs of these actions are expected to be offset by
proceeds on asset dispositions and tax recoveries.

In the
fourth quarter of 2006, as part of the realignment of the metal food and
household products packaging, Americas, segment, a charge of $35.5 million
($28.7 million after tax) was recorded primarily related to the closure of
a plant in Burlington, Ontario, for employee termination and pension costs,
plant decommissioning costs and fixed asset impairment charges. The Burlington
plant was sold during the third quarter of 2008 completing the restructuring
plan, except for pension costs, which resulted in an additional $0.3 million in
business consolidation charges.

As
reported in our second quarter Form 10-Q, during the third quarter our aerosol
business experienced a tinplate supply issue due to a major supplier’s failure
to deliver committed metal. While this matter affected a limited, seasonal part
of this segment’s product mix, it caused a supply disruption with some of our
customers that resulted in lost sales and profitability for Ball during the
year. We have made every effort to fulfill our customers’ requests and minimize
the impact on our customer base. We are now receiving the necessary tinplate to
produce products for our customers, and future raw material supply arrangements
are scheduled.

Plastic
Packaging, Americas

The
plastic packaging, Americas, segment consists of operations located in the U.S.
and Canada (through most of the third quarter of 2008), which manufacture PET
and polypropylene plastic container products used mainly in beverage and food
packaging, as well as high density polyethylene and polypropylene containers for
industrial and household product applications. On March 28, 2006, Ball acquired
certain North American plastic bottle container

Page 24
of 96

assets
from Alcan Packaging (Alcan), including two plastic container manufacturing
plants in the U.S. and one in Canada, as well as certain manufacturing equipment
and other assets from other Alcan facilities. Effective January 1, 2007,
the plastic packaging, Americas, segment assumed responsibility for plastic pail
assets acquired as part of the U.S. Can acquisition. Accordingly, 2006 segment
amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the transfer.
Manufacturing operations ceased in Canada during the third quarter of 2008 with
the closure of the Brampton, Ontario, plant.

This
segment accounted for 9 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008
(10 percent in both 2007 and 2006). Segment sales in 2008 decreased 2
percent, or approximately $17 million, as compared to 2007 due to a decrease of
approximately 9 percent in sales volume offset by higher raw material cost
increases passed through to customers during 2008. The volume loss included
decreases in carbonated soft drink and water bottle sales due, in part, to lower
convenience store sales by our customers, which were partially offset by higher
sales in specialty business markets (e.g., custom hot-fill, alcohol, food and
juice drinks). Reduced preform sales also contributed to the 2008 sales decrease
due, in part, to the bankruptcy filing of a preform customer. Segment sales in
2007 increased 8 percent as compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase
in sales of 7 percent related to the March 2006 acquisition of Alcan and
the inclusion of the acquired U.S. Can plastic pail business, as well as an
increase of 3 percent for higher sales volumes related to the legacy
business.

Segment
earnings were $7.5

million in 2008,
$25.9 million in 2007 and $28.3 million in 2006. Excluding the
business consolidation charges of $8.3 million in 2008 (further details are
provided below) and $0.4 million in 2007, earnings in 2008 were lower than in
2007 by approximately 40 percent primarily due to the previously mentioned
volume losses and a $1.8 million charge due to a customer bankruptcy filing
during the second quarter of 2008. Earnings in 2007 were lower than in 2006
primarily due to lower sales margins related to approximately $5 million of
customer pricing concessions and $2 million of higher labor and overhead
costs. The earnings inhibitors were partially offset by approximately
$2 million from volume growth in specialty PET sales combined with the
incremental margin impact of sales in the first quarter of 2007 related to the
acquired Alcan and U.S. Can plants. In view of the low PET margins, we continue
to focus our efforts on price and margin recovery initiatives, as well as PET
development efforts in the custom hot-fill, beer, wine, flavored alcoholic
beverage and specialty container markets. In the polypropylene plastic container
arena, development efforts are primarily focused on custom packaging
markets.

We
estimate our 2008 shipments of PET plastic bottles to be approximately
10 percent of total U.S. and Canadian PET container shipments. In addition
the plastic packaging, Americas, segment shipped approximately 750 million
polypropylene food and specialty containers during 2008.

On June
26, 2008, Ball announced the closure of a plastic packaging manufacturing plant
in Brampton, Ontario, which ceased operations in the third quarter of 2008. A
pretax charge of $8.3 million ($7.8 million after tax) was recorded during 2008
for employee termination and other benefit costs, lease cancellation costs and
fixed asset impairment. The Brampton operations have been consolidated into the
company’s other plastic packaging manufacturing facilities in the United States,
and the closure of this facility is expected to result in annual, fixed-cost
savings of approximately $4 million beginning in 2009.

Aerospace
and Technologies

Aerospace
and technologies segment sales represented 10 percent of consolidated net
sales in 2008 (11 percent in 2007 and 10 percent in 2006). Segment sales in
2008 were 5 percent lower as compared to 2007 as a result of a combination of
large programs nearing completion, program terminations, delays in program
awards and government funding constraints. The reductions were partially offset
by new program starts and increased scope on previously awarded contracts.
Segment sales in 2007 were 17 percent higher than in 2006 due to new
programs, cost overruns on fixed-price contracts, increased scope on previously
awarded contracts and growth in our commercial contracts.

Some of
the segment’s high-profile contracts include: the WorldView 2 advanced
commercial remote sensing satellites; the James Webb Space Telescope, a
successor to the Hubble Space Telescope; the Space-Based Space Surveillance
System, which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital
debris; NPOESS, the next-generation satellite weather monitoring system; and a
number of antennas for the Joint Strike Fighter.

Segment
earnings in 2008 were $83.3 million ($76.2 million excluding the sale of an
Australian subsidiary discussed in more detail below), $64.6 million in
2007 and $50 million in 2006. Excluding the pretax gain on the sale of BSG
of $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2008, earnings in 2008 were up 18
percent in comparison to 2007. Earnings improved year over year as the sales
volume decline described above was more than offset by improved margins on
contracts due to improvements in program execution, risk retirement on several
fixed price programs, as well as a reduction of unreimbursable pension and
benefit expenses. Earnings improvement in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily
due to higher net sales, particularly related to the WorldView and other
commercial space contracts, an improved contract mix and better program
execution.

On
February 15, 2008, Ball completed the sale of its shares in BSG to QinetiQ
Pty Ltd for approximately $10.5 million, including cash sold of $1.8
million. BSG provided services to the Australian department of defense and
related government agencies. After an adjustment for working capital items, the
sale resulted in a pretax gain of $7.1 million.

Sales to
the U.S. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a
subcontractor, represented 91 percent of segment sales in 2008,
84 percent in 2007 and 90 percent in 2006. Contracted backlog for the
aerospace and technologies segment at December 31, 2008 and 2007, was
$597 million and $774 million, respectively.

Additional
Segment Information

For
additional information regarding the company’s segments, see the summary of
business segment information in Note 2 accompanying the consolidated financial
statements within Item 8 of this report. The charges recorded for business
consolidation activities were based on estimates by Ball management and were
developed from information available at the time. If actual outcomes vary from
the estimates, the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in
the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation
gains and losses. Additional details about our business consolidation activities
and associated costs are provided in Note 6 accompanying the consolidated
financial statements within Item 8 of this report.

Undistributed
Corporate Expenses, Net

Undistributed
corporate expenses, net, were $39.6 million, $38.3 million and $37.5 million for
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Included in the undistributed corporate
expenses for 2008 was $11.5 million for mark-to-market losses related to
aluminum derivative instruments that will reverse and result in a gain in 2009.
These aluminum derivative instruments are fully matched with customer sales
arrangements that mature in 2009; therefore, the mark-to-market losses will
reverse in 2009 resulting in $11.5 million of pretax earnings.

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and
administrative (SG&A) expenses were $288.2 million, $323.7 million
and $287.2 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The
decreases in SG&A expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 were due to
$7.6 million of lower general and administrative costs as a result of the
sale in February 2008 of the aerospace and technologies segment’s Australian
subsidiary, lower aerospace research and development costs and bid and proposal
costs of $3.7 million, life insurance death benefits of $6.5 million, settlement
of a claim for approximately $7 million, the favorable net year-over-year
change in foreign currency hedges and exchange impacts of $11.6 million and
other miscellaneous net cost reductions.

The
increase in SG&A expenses in 2007 compared to 2006 were $4.5 million of
additional SG&A from the U.S. Can acquisition, higher research and
development costs and aerospace bid and proposal costs of $9.4 million,
increased sales and marketing efforts of $5.4 million and
$15.8 million of compensation and benefit increases, including
year-over-year incentive compensation costs.

For the
U.S. pension plans, we intend to maintain our current return on asset assumption
of 8.25 percent and our discount rate assumption of 6.25 percent for 2009. Based
on these assumptions and excluding 2008 curtailment expense, U.S. pension
expense for 2009 is anticipated to increase $3.9 million compared to 2008, most
of which will be included in cost of sales. Pension expense in Europe and Canada
combined is expected to be comparable to the 2008 expense. A reduction of
the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a
percentage

Page 26
of 96

point
would result in an approximate $2.4 million increase in the 2009 pension
expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate
applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated $2.8 million of
additional pension expense in 2009. Additional information regarding the
company’s pension plans is provided in Note 17 accompanying the consolidated
financial statements within Item 8 of this report.

Interest
and Taxes

Consolidated
interest expense was $137.7 million in 2008, $149.4 million in 2007
and $134.4 million in 2006. The reduced expense in 2008 was primarily due
to lower interest rates on floating rate debt, as U.S. and European Central
Banks cut interest rates amid the global financial crisis. The higher expense in
2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to the additional borrowings used to
finance the acquisitions of U.S. Can and the Alcan assets, combined with higher
interest rates in 2007.

Ball’s
consolidated effective income tax rate for 2008 was 32.6 percent compared
to 26.3 percent in 2007 and 29.4 percent in 2006. The lower tax
rate in 2007 as compared to 2008 and 2006 was primarily the result of earnings
mix (higher foreign earnings taxed at lower rates) and net tax benefit
adjustments of $17.2 million recorded in 2007. Additionally, the inability to
fully use Canadian net operating losses on plant closures in 2008 and 2006
contributed to higher rates in those years. The 2008 rate was partially reduced
by a $4.5 million tax benefit recognized during the third quarter of 2008 for an
enacted tax law change in the United Kingdom, which was offset by the impact of
non-deductible losses in the cash surrender value of certain company-owned life
insurance plans. The $17.2 million net reduction in the 2007 tax provision was
primarily a result of enacted income tax rate reductions in Germany and the
United Kingdom and a tax loss related to the company’s Canadian operations,
which were offset by an increase in the tax provision in 2007 to adjust for the
final settlement negotiations concluded with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
related to a company-owned life insurance plan (discussed below).

Based on current
estimates, the 2009 effective income tax rate is expected to be around
33.5 percent.

During 2007 the company
concluded final settlement negotiations with the IRS on the deductibility of
interest expense on incurred loans from a company-owned life insurance plan. An
additional accrual of $7 million was made in the third quarter of 2007 to adjust
the accrued liability to the final settlement of $18.4 million, including
interest, for the

years 2000-2004, which were under examination, and for
the unaudited years 2005-2006. This settlement included agreement on the
prospective treatment of interest deductibility on the policy loans, which will
not have a significant impact on earnings per share, cash flow or liquidity in
future periods. Further details are available in Note 16 to the consolidated
financial statements within Item 8 of this report.

Results
of Equity Affiliates

Equity in
the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our 50 percent
ownership in packaging investments in the U.S. and Brazil. Earnings were
$14.5 million in 2008, $12.9 million in 2007 and $14.7 million in
2006.

CRITICAL
AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING
PRONOUNCEMENTS

For
information regarding the company’s critical and significant accounting
policies, as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this
report.

FINANCIAL
CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash
Flows and Capital Expenditures

Our
primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and
external committed borrowings. We believe that cash flows from operations and
cash provided by short-term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary,
will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled
principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated
capital expenditures. We had in excess of half a billion dollars of available
funds under committed multi-currency revolving credit facilities at December 31,
2008. However, our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in
demand for our products, which could arise from

competitive
circumstances, the current global credit, financial and economic crisis or any
of the other factors we describe in Item 1A, “Risk
Factors.”

Page 27
of 96

In our
worldwide beverage can business, we use financial derivative contracts as
discussed in “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” within
Item 7A of this report to manage future aluminum price volatility for our
customers. As these derivative contracts are matched to customer sales
contracts, they have little or no economic impact on our earnings. Ball’s
financial counterparties to these derivative contracts require Ball to post
collateral in certain circumstances when the negative mark-to-market value of
the contracts exceeds specified levels. Additionally, Ball has similar
collateral posting arrangements with certain customers and other financial
counterparties on these derivative contracts. At December 31, 2008, Ball had
$229.5 million of cash posted as collateral and had received $124 million of
cash from customers for a net amount of $105.5 million. The cash flows of the
collateral postings are shown in the investing section of our consolidated
statements of cash flows. Assuming aluminum prices remain unchanged, we would
expect to recover all of these cash deposits in 2009.

Cash flows provided by
operations were $627.6 million in 2008 compared to $673 million in
2007 and $401.4 million in 2006.

The reduction in 2008 as compared
to 2007 was primarily due to the payment of approximately $70 million in January
2008 of a legal settlement to a customer. This reduction was partially offset by
the net impact of increases in net earnings and depreciation, lower tax
payments, lower pension contributions and a net increase in working capital
during the year. The improvement in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due
to higher net earnings before the legal settlement in 2007 and the insurance
gain in 2006 related to the Hassloch fire. The improvement in 2007 was also the
result of reduced changes in working capital components and lower income tax
payments, partially offset by higher pension contributions.

Management
internally uses a free cash flow measure: (1) to evaluate the company’s
operating results, (2) to plan stock-buy back levels, (3) to evaluate
strategic investments and (4) to evaluate the company’s ability to incur and
service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash
flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines
free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to
property, plant and equipment (capital spending). Free cash flow is typically
derived directly from the company’s cash flow statements; however, it may be
adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods. An example of such
an item included the company’s decision in 2007 to contribute an additional
$44.5 million ($27.3 million after tax) to its pension
plans.  Additional examples include property insurance proceeds for
the replacement of the fire-damaged assets in our Hassloch, Germany, plant,
which are included in capital spending amounts in 2006.

Based on
this, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows:

      in millions)

Based on
information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating
activities for 2009 to be approximately $625 million, capital spending to
be approximately $250 million and free cash flow to be in the
$375 million range. Capital spending of $306.9 million in 2008
exceeded depreciation and amortization expense of $297.4 million. We have
reduced our expected capital spending year over year, and we do not intend to
buy back stock until the capital markets show sufficient signs of recovery.
Initially in 2009 we will focus on reducing our debt and growing our cash
balances.

Debt
Facilities and Refinancing

Interest-bearing
debt at December 31, 2008, increased $51.5 million to
$2.41 billion from $2.36 billion at December 31, 2007. The 2008
debt increase from 2007 was primarily due to the financing of $105.5 million in
net cash collateral deposits. In 2009 we intend to allocate our operating cash
flow to reducing our debt and growing our cash balances while covering our
capital spending programs, dividends and incremental pension
funding.

At
December 31, 2008, $502 million was available under the company’s
multi-currency revolving credit facilities. The company also had
$332 million of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at the
end of the year, of which $155.6 million was outstanding. The committed
credit facilities are available until October 2011.

Page 28
of 96

Given our
free cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until
October 2011, the company’s liquidity is strong and is expected to meet its
ongoing operating cash flow and debt service requirements. While the current
financial and economic conditions have raised concerns about credit risk with
counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by
spreading the risk among various counterparties, thus limiting exposure with any
one party. The company also monitors the credit ratings of its suppliers,
customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis.

The
current financial and economic environment has exacerbated liquidity and credit
risks with some of our customers and suppliers. In October 2008, we advanced
interest-bearing funding of $22 million in support of one of our key suppliers,
which advance is secured by accounts receivable and
inventory.

The
company has a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing,
revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of Ball’s North
American packaging operations up to $250 million. The agreement qualifies
as off-balance sheet financing under the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, as amended by SFAS No. 156.
Net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled
$250 million and $170 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the
consolidated balance sheets.

The
company was in compliance with all loan agreements at December 31, 2008,
and all prior years presented, and has met all debt payment obligations. The
U.S. note agreements, bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue
bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments,
financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness.
Additional details about the company’s debt and receivables sales agreements are
available in Notes 15 and 9, respectively, accompanying the consolidated
financial statements within Item 8 of this report.

      variable prices and/or usage are involved, management’s best estimates
      have been used. Depending on the circumstances, early termination of the
      contracts may not result in penalties and, therefore, actual payments
      could vary significantly.

Contributions
to the company’s defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded
German plans, may be in the range of $88 million to $93 million in 2009.
This estimate may change based on changes in the Pension Protection Act and
actual plan asset performance, among other factors. Benefit payments related to
these plans are expected to be $69.5 million, $73.7 million,
$76.4 million, $81 million and $84.5 million for the years ending

December 31, 2009 through 2013, respectively, and a total of
$482.7 million for the years 2014 through 2018. Payments to participants in
the unfunded German plans are expected to be approximately $24 million to
$25 million in each of the years 2009 through 2013 and a total of
$125.6 million for the years 2014 through 2018.

Our share
repurchases in 2008 aggregated $299.6 million, net of issuances, compared
to $211.3 million net of repurchases in 2007 and $45.7 million in
2006. The net repurchases in 2008 included a $31 million settlement on January
7, 2008, of a forward contract entered into in December 2007 for the repurchase
of 675,000 shares. Additionally, in 2007 net repurchases included a
$51.9 million settlement on January 5, 2007, of a forward contract
entered into in December 2006 for the repurchase of 1,200,000 shares.
We do not expect to repurchase a significant number of common shares in
2009.

On
December 12, 2007, in a privately negotiated transaction, Ball entered into
an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy $100 million of its common
shares using cash on hand and available borrowings. The company advanced the
$100 million on January 7, 2008, and received 2,038,657 shares,
which represented 90 percent of the total shares as calculated using the
previous day’s closing price. The agreement was settled on July 11, 2008, and
the company received an additional 138,521 shares.

Annual
cash dividends paid on common stock were 40 cents per share in 2008, 2007
and 2006. Total dividends paid were $37.5 million in 2008,
$40.6 million in 2007 and $41 million in 2006.

Contingencies

The
company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of
business due, in part, to the competitive nature of the industries in which the
company participates. We do business in countries outside the U.S., have
changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our
packaging products and participate in changing capital markets. We attempt to
reduce these risks and uncertainties through the establishment of risk
management policies and procedures, including, at times, the use of certain
derivative financial instruments as explained in Item 7A of this
report.

From time
to time, the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its
businesses. Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has
designated Ball as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other
companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites.

Pursuant
to the merger agreement with the former shareholders of U.S. Can, a certain
portion of the common share consideration issued for the acquisition of U.S. Can
was placed in escrow and was subsequently converted into cash, which was to be
used for the settlement of certain post-acquisition claims, pursuant to the
terms of the merger agreement. During the second quarter of 2007, Ball asserted
claims against the former shareholders of U.S. Can, which were disputed. The
representative for the former shareholders of U.S. Can filed a lawsuit against
the company in the first quarter of 2008 seeking a declaration of the parties’
rights and obligations with respect to the claims asserted by the company. This
matter was settled during the fourth quarter of 2008.

Our
information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a
material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial
condition of the company.

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future events could affect
these estimates. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within
Item 8 of this report for a summary of the company’s critical and
significant accounting policies.

Management
believes that evaluation of Ball’s performance during the periods covered by
these consolidated financial statements should be based upon historical
financial statements.

Item
7A.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

Financial
Instruments and Risk Management

In the
ordinary course of business, we employ established risk management policies and
procedures, which seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity
prices, interest rates, foreign currencies and prices of the company’s common
stock in regard to common share repurchases, although there can be no assurance
that these policies and procedures will be successful. Although the instruments
utilized involve varying degrees of credit, market and interest risk, the
counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms
of the agreements. The company monitors counterparty credit risk, including
lenders, on a regular basis, but we cannot be certain that all risks will be
discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be
effective.

We have
estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Market risk
exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative
instruments, financial instruments and commodity positions. To test the
sensitivity of our market risk exposure, we have estimated the changes in fair
value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical
10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates. The results of the
sensitivity analysis are summarized below.

Commodity
Price Risk

We manage
our North American commodity price risk in connection with market price
fluctuations of aluminum ingot primarily by entering into container sales
contracts that include aluminum ingot-based pricing terms that generally reflect
price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum sheet
purchases. The terms include fixed, floating or pass-through aluminum ingot
component pricing. This matched pricing affects most of our North American metal
beverage packaging net sales. We also, at times, use certain derivative
instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow and fair value
hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass-through arrangement in
the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales
volumes and pricing.

Most of
the plastic packaging, Americas, sales contracts include provisions to fully
pass through resin cost changes. As a result, we believe we have minimal
exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin. Most metal food and
household products packaging, Americas, sales contracts either include
provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we
incur, or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs. In 2008 and in 2007,
we were able to pass through to our customers the majority of steel cost
increases. We anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the
majority of the steel price increases that occur over the next 12
months.

In Europe
and the PRC, the company manages the aluminum and steel raw material commodity
price risks through annual and long-term contracts for the purchase of the
materials, as well as certain sales of containers that reduce the company's
exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year. These
purchase and sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass-through
pricing arrangements. We also use forward and option contracts as cash flow
hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures to
match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing for
those sales contracts where there is not a pass-through arrangement to minimize
the company’s exposure to significant price changes.

Considering
the effects of derivative instruments, the company’s ability to pass through
certain raw material costs through contractual provisions, the market’s ability
to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures under its
contract terms, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s
steel, aluminum and resin prices could result in an estimated $6 million
after-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year period. Additionally, if
foreign currency exchange rates were to change adversely by 10 percent, we
estimate there could be an $8 million after-tax reduction in net earnings
over a one-year period for foreign currency exposures on raw materials. Actual
results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and
rates.

The
company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and
electricity, as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost.
A hypothetical 10 percent increase in our natural gas and electricity
prices, without considering such pass-through provisions, could result in an
estimated $7 million after-tax reduction of net earnings

Page 32
of 96

over a
one-year period. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in diesel fuel prices
could result in an estimated $2 million after-tax reduction of net earnings
over the same period. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market
prices and rates. Subsequent to year end, the company has taken further steps to
reduce its exposure to natural gas and diesel fuel prices in 2009.

Interest
Rate Risk

Our
objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the
impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our
overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we use a variety of
interest rate swaps, collars and options to manage our mix of floating and
fixed-rate debt. Interest rate instruments held by the company at December 31,
2008, included pay-fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate collars.
Pay-fixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate
instruments. Collars create an upper and lower threshold within which interest
rates will fluctuate.

Based on
our interest rate exposure at December 31, 2008, assumed floating rate debt
levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of derivative instruments,
a 100-basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated
$7 million after-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year period.
Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and
the timing of these changes.

Foreign
Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Our
objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect
foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency
exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts. In
addition we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of
various foreign currency option strategies, and the change in the fair value of
those options is recorded in the company’s earnings. Our foreign currency
translation risk results from the European euro, British pound, Canadian dollar,
Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Hong Kong dollar, Brazilian real, Argentine peso
and Serbian dinar. We face currency exposures in our global operations as a
result of purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars and, to a lesser extent, in
other currencies. Sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost
changes and, where there is not a foreign exchange pass-through arrangement, the
company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures.
We additionally use various option strategies to manage the earnings translation
of the company’s European operations into U.S. dollars.

Considering
the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31,
2008, and the currency exposures, a hypothetical 10 percent reduction (U.S.
dollar strengthening) in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S.
dollar could result in an estimated $18 million after-tax reduction in net
earnings over a one-year period. This amount includes the $8 million
currency exposure discussed above in the “Commodity Price Risk” section. This
hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce
our forecasted average debt balance by $84 million. Actual changes in
market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes.

Common
Share Repurchases

As part
of the company’s ongoing share repurchase program and as a way to partially
reduce the earnings volatility of the company’s variable deferred compensation
stock program, from time to time the company sells equity put options on its
common stock. The company currently has 500,000 shares of equity put options
outstanding at a strike price of $40 per share that expire in less than 12
months.

On
December 3, 2007, Ball entered into a forward repurchase agreement for the
purchase of 675,000 shares of its common stock. This agreement was settled
for $31 million on January 7, 2008, and the shares were delivered that
day. On December 12, 2007, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase
agreement for approximately $100 million. The agreement provided for the
delivery of 2,038,657 shares, which represented 90 percent of the
total estimated shares to ultimately be delivered. The $100 million was
paid on January 7, 2008, at the time the shares were delivered. The
agreement was settled on July 11, 2008, and the company received an additional
138,521 shares.

Item
8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the
Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ball Corporation:

In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing
under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries

at December 31, 2008 and
2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2008

in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these
financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control
over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1.  
Critical and Significant Accounting Policies

In the
application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingencies and
reported amounts of revenues and expenses. These estimates are based on
historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.

Critical
Accounting Policies

The
company considers certain accounting policies to be critical, as their
application requires management’s best judgment in making estimates about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Following is a discussion of
the accounting policies we consider critical to our consolidated financial
statements.

Revenue
Recognition in the Aerospace and Technologies Segment

Sales
under long-term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment are
primarily recognized under the cost-to-cost, percentage-of-completion method.
This business segment sells using two types of long-term sales contracts –
cost-type sales contracts, which represent approximately two-thirds of
sales, and fixed price sales contracts, which account for the remainder. A
cost-type sales contract is an agreement to perform the contract for cost plus
an agreed upon profit component, whereas fixed price sales contracts are
completed for a fixed price or involve the sale of engineering labor at fixed
rates per hour. Cost-type sales contracts can have different types of fee
arrangements, including fixed fee, cost, milestone and performance incentive
fees, award fees or a combination thereof.

During
initial periods of sales contract performance, our estimates of base, incentive
and other fees are established at a conservative estimate of profit over the
period of contract performance. Throughout the period of contract performance,
we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of total
contract revenue, total contract cost and extent of progress toward completion.
Provision for estimated contract losses, if any, is made in the period that such
losses are determined to be probable. Because of sales contract payment
schedules, limitations on funding and contract terms, our sales and accounts
receivable generally include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.
As a prime U.S. government contractor or subcontractor, the aerospace and
technologies segment is subject to a high degree of regulation, financial review
and oversight by the U.S. government.

Acquisitions

The
company accounts for acquisitions using the purchase method as required by SFAS
No. 141, “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141). Under
SFAS No. 141, the acquiring company allocates the purchase price to
the assets acquired, including intangible assets that can be identified and
named, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date
of acquisition. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net assets
and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Among other sources of relevant
information, the company uses independent appraisals and actuarial or other
valuations to assist in determining the estimated fair values of the assets and
liabilities. SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (SFAS No.
141 (revised 2007)) replaces the original SFAS No. 141 issued in
June 2001 effective January 1, 2009, as discussed below in the new
accounting standards.

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

We
evaluate the carrying value of goodwill at the reporting unit level annually and
when circumstances require utilizing the two-step impairment test prescribed by
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS No. 142), using the
notion of implied fair value in the second step whenever a potential impairment
is identified in the first step. For this evaluation, our reporting units are
consistent with our reportable segments identified in Note 2 except that assets
within metal beverage packaging, Americas, are tested separately from those in
Asia. These reporting units have been identified based on the level at which
discrete financial information is available to segment management. The fair
values of goodwill are estimated using the net present value of discounted
cash

Page 39

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

Ball
Corporation and Subsidiaries

1.  
Critical and Significant Accounting Policies

(continued)

flows,
excluding any financing costs or dividends, generated by each reporting
unit.  Our discounted cash flows are based upon reasonable and appropriate
assumptions, which are weighted for their likely probability of occurrence,
about the underlying business activities of our reporting units. We recognize an
impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill
exceeds its fair value. When a business within a reporting unit is disposed of,
goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition using the relative fair
value methodology. Our methodology of valuing goodwill has not changed from the
prior year.

We
amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives
unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are
tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, are
written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised
values. We test annually, and when circumstances require, intangible assets with
indefinite lives for impairment, which are written down to fair value as deemed
necessary.

Defined
Benefit Pension Plans and Other Employee Benefits

The
company has defined benefit plans that cover the majority of its employees. We
also have postretirement plans that provide certain medical benefits and life
insurance for retirees and eligible dependents. The accounting for these plans
is subject to the guidance provided in SFAS No. 158; SFAS No. 87,

“

Employers’
Accounting for Pensions;

”

SFAS
No. 106,

“

Employers

’

Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions

”

and
SFAS No. 112, “Employers

’

Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 43.” These
statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the
long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to measure future
obligations and expenses, salary scale inflation rates, health care cost trend
rates, mortality and other assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates
related to our pension and postretirement plans are critical accounting
estimates, because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period
based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions
and contracted benefit changes. The selection of assumptions is based on
historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of
valuation. However, actual results may differ substantially from the estimates
that were based on the critical assumptions.

Pension
plan liabilities are revalued annually based on updated assumptions and
information about the individuals covered by the plan. For pension plans,
accumulated gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor, the prior
service cost and the transition asset are amortized on a straight-line basis
from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active
participants. For other postemployment benefits, the 10 percent corridor is
not used.

Effective
with its December 31, 2006, year-end reporting, Ball adopted
SFAS No. 158, which requires the recognition of the funded status of
each defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan on the
consolidated balance sheet. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset, and
each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability.

In
addition to defined benefit and postretirement plans, the company maintains
reserves for employee medical claims, up to our insurance stop-loss limit, and
workers’ compensation claims. These are regularly evaluated and revised, as
needed, based on a variety of information, including historical experience,
actuarial estimates and current employee statistics.

Taxes
on Income

Deferred
tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carry
forwards, are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that any portion of these tax attributes
will not be realized. In addition from time to time, management must assess the
need to accrue or disclose a possible loss contingency for proposed adjustments
from various federal, state and foreign tax authorities who regularly audit the
company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments,
management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions,
including many foreign jurisdictions.

1.  
Critical and Significant Accounting Policies

(continued)

Deferred
income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each
balance sheet date, based upon enacted income tax laws and tax rates. Income tax
expense or benefit is provided based on earnings reported in the financial
statements. The provision for income tax expense or benefit differs from the
amounts of income taxes currently payable because certain items of income and
expense included in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in
different time periods by taxing authorities.

In
June 2006 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Interpretation (FIN) 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48), which prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a
tax return. The company records the related interest expense and penalties, if
any, as a tax expense, consistent with the practice prior to adoption.
Additional details about the adoption of FIN 48 are provided in
Note 16. In May 2007 the FASB amended FIN 48 by issuing FASB Staff
Position (FSP) FIN 48-1, which provides guidance on how an enterprise
should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose
of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The adoption of
FSP FIN 48-1 did not result in any changes to the amounts recorded in
accordance with FIN 48.

Business
Consolidation Costs

The
company estimates its liabilities for business consolidation activities by
accumulating detailed estimates of costs and asset sales proceeds, if any, for
each business consolidation initiative. This includes the estimated costs of
employee severance, pension and related benefits; impairment of property and
equipment and other assets, including estimates of net realizable value;
accelerated depreciation; contract termination payments for contracts and
leases; contractual obligations and any other qualifying costs related to the
exit plan. These estimated costs are grouped by specific projects within the
overall exit plan and are then monitored on a monthly basis. Such disclosures
represent management

’

s best estimates,
but require assumptions about the plans that may change over time. Changes in
estimates for individual locations and other matters are evaluated periodically
to determine if a change in estimate is required for the overall restructuring
plan. Subsequent changes to the original estimates are included in current
period earnings and identified as business consolidation gains or
losses.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

The
company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging
exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
product sales, raw materials purchasing, inflation rates and common share
repurchases. The company’s derivative instruments are recorded in the
consolidated balance sheets at fair value. For a derivative designated as a fair
value hedge of a recognized asset or liability, the gain or loss is recognized
in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on
the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. For a derivative
designated as a cash flow hedge, or a derivative designated as a fair value
hedge of a firm commitment not yet recorded on the balance sheet, the effective
portion of the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive earnings and subsequently reclassified into
earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective
portion of the gain or loss associated with all hedges is reported in earnings
immediately. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to
market with gains and losses also reported immediately in earnings. In the
statements of cash flows, derivative activities are classified in the same
category as the items being hedged. The accounting for our cash collateral calls
related to our derivative activities are classified as investing activities as
discussed in Note 3.

Realized
gains and losses from hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of
earnings consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged.
Gains and losses upon the early termination of effective derivative contracts
are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive earnings and amortized to
earnings in the same period as the originally hedged items affect
earnings.

Significant
Accounting Policies

Principles
of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ball Corporation and
its controlled subsidiaries (collectively, Ball, the company, we or our). Equity
investments in which we exercise significant influence but do not control and
are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. Investments in which we do not exercise significant influence over
the investee are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Intercompany
transactions are eliminated.

Cash
Equivalents

Cash
equivalents have original maturities of three months or less.

Inventories

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
cost method of accounting.

Depreciation
and Amortization

Property,
plant and equipment are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction and
depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation and
amortization are provided using the straight-line method in amounts sufficient
to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives (buildings
and improvements – 10 to 40 years; machinery and equipment – 3 to
15 years; other intangible assets – 13 years, weighted
average).

Deferred
financing costs are amortized over the life of the related loan facility and are
reported as part of interest expense. When debt is repaid prior to its maturity
date, the write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs, or
pro rata portion thereof, is also reported as interest expense.

Under
certain business consolidation activities, accelerated depreciation may be
required over the remaining useful life for designated assets to be scrapped or
abandoned. The accelerated depreciation related to plant closures is disclosed
as part of the business consolidation costs in the appropriate
period.

Environmental
Reserves

We
estimate the liability related to environmental matters based on, among other
factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to
make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. We record our best estimate of
a loss when the loss is considered probable. As additional information becomes
available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending matters and
revise our estimates.

Revenue
Recognition in the Packaging Segments

Sales of
products in the packaging segments are recognized when delivery has occurred and
title has transferred, there is persuasive evidence of an agreement or
arrangement, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably
assured.

Fair
Value Measurements

Effective
January 1, 2008, the company adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”
(SFAS No. 157), which establishes a framework for measuring value and emphasizes
that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific
measurement, and should be determined based on the assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Fair value losses or
gains are reported in earnings when identified.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Ball has
a variety of restricted stock and stock option plans. The compensation cost
associated with restricted stock grants has been calculated using the fair value
at the date of grant and amortized over the restriction period. Stock-based
compensation is reported as part of selling, general and administrative expenses
in the consolidated statements of earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2006, Ball
amended one of its deferred compensation stock plans to allow for limited
diversification beginning in 2007, which required an initial mark-to-market
adjustment of $6.7 million.

Effective
January 1, 2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),
“Share-Based Payment,” and elected to use the modified prospective transition
method and the Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected stock price
volatility assumption utilized in the model was calculated from the historical
method. Tax benefits associated with option exercises are reported in financing
activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Further details
regarding the expense calculated under the fair value based method are provided
in Note 18.

Foreign
Currency Translation

Assets
and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using period-end exchange
rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates
during each period. Translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated
other comprehensive earnings as a component of shareholders’
equity.

Reclassifications

Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to the current
year presentation.

Accounting
Pronouncements

Recently
Adopted Accounting Standards

SFAS No.
157 became effective for Ball on January 1, 2008. At this time, the
January 1, 2008, adoption covers only financial assets and liabilities and
those nonfinancial assets and liabilities already disclosed at fair value in the
financial statements on a recurring basis but, subject to a deferral, will be
expanded to all other nonfinancial assets and liabilities as of January 1,
2009. The company is in the process of evaluating what impact applying SFAS No.
157 to all other nonfinancial assets and liabilities will have on its
consolidated financial statements but does not anticipate any material impact at
this time. Details regarding the adoption of SFAS No. 157 and its
effects on the company’s consolidated financial statements are available in
Note 20.

New
Accounting Standards

In
December 2007 the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements – an Amendment of ARB No. 51” (SFAS No. 160).
This statement amends accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling
interest in a subsidiary, requiring that such interests be reported as a
separate component of shareholders’ equity. SFAS No. 160 also requires separate
presentation in the consolidated statements of income of net income allocable to
the noncontrolling interests from that attributable to the company’s
shareholders. This statement is effective for Ball beginning on January 1, 2009,
and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

Critical and Significant Accounting Policies

(continued)

In
December 2007 the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), which
replaces the original SFAS No. 141 issued in June 2001. The new
standard retains the fundamental requirements in SFAS No. 141 that the
purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an
acquirer to be identified for each business combination. SFAS No. 141
(revised 2007) requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed measured at their fair values on the acquisition date, which
replaces SFAS No. 141’s cost-allocation process. This standard also
requires all costs to effect the acquisition and any related restructuring costs
to be expensed as incurred. The new standard will be effective for Ball
beginning on January 1, 2009, inasmuch as we enter into a business
combination transaction.

In
March 2008 the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures About
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities – an Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 133” (SFAS No. 161). SFAS No. 161 is intended to enhance the
current disclosure requirements in SFAS No. 133. It requires that
objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying
risk and accounting designation, as well as information about
credit-risk-related contingent features. It also requires a company to disclose
the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a
tabular format to make the location of the derivative positions existing at
period end and the effect of using derivatives during the reporting period more
transparent in the company’s financial statements. The company also will be
required to cross-reference information about derivative instruments within the
footnotes to help users of the financial statements. SFAS No. 161 is
effective for Ball beginning on January 1, 2009, and will not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
April 2008 the FASB issued FSP No. 142-3, “Determination of the
Useful Life of Intangible Assets” (FSP No. 142-3). This guidance amends the
factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions
used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS
No. 142. FSP No. 142-3 is effective for Ball as of January 1, 2009, on a
prospective basis, and early adoption is prohibited. The company does not
anticipate it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements at this time.

In
November 2008 the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF 08-06, “Equity
Method Investment Accounting Considerations” (EITF 08-06). EITF 08-06 requires
an entity to measure its equity method investment initially at cost, to
recognize other-than-temporary impairments recorded by an investee and to
account for a share issuance by an investee as if the investor had sold a
proportionate share of its investment. The guidance will be effective for Ball
on January 1, 2009. The company does not anticipate it will have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements at this time.

Also in
November 2008, the EITF issued EITF 08-07, “Accounting for Defensive Intangible
Assets” (EITF 08-07). EITF 08-07 requires that a defensive intangible asset
(acquired intangible asset that the acquirer does not intend to actively use for
more than a transition period) be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting
with a useful life that reflects the entity’s consumption of the expected
benefits related to that asset and not be aggregated with an entity’s existing
intangible assets. The guidance will be effective for Ball on January 1, 2009,
inasmuch as we enter into a business combination.

In
December 2008 the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures
About Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets” (FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1).

This guidance requires
disclosure of how investment allocation decisions are made, including the
factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and
strategies, the major categories of plan assets, significant concentrations of
risk within plan assets, inputs and valuation techniques to measure fair value
and the effect of significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for
the period. FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1 is effective for Ball for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2009. The company is in the process of evaluating the impact
this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Business Segment Information

Ball’s
operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines,
after aggregating operating segments that have similar economic characteristics
resulting in five reportable segments. Due to first quarter 2008 management
reporting changes, Ball’s operations in the People’s Republic of China (PRC)
with 2008 net sales of $289.6 million are now aggregated and included in
the metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment (previously included
with the company’s European operations). Also, effective January 1, 2007, a
plastic pail product line with 2007 net sales of $52.1 million was
transferred from the metal food and household products packaging, Americas,
segment to the plastic packaging, Americas, segment. Prior periods have been
retrospectively adjusted to the current presentation.

Metal
beverage packaging, Americas and Asia

:

Consists of
operations in the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico (through the end of 2008) and the
PRC, which manufacture and sell metal beverage containers in North America and
the PRC, as well as non-beverage plastic containers in the PRC.

Metal
beverage packaging, Europe

:

Consists of
operations in several countries in Europe, which manufacture and sell metal
beverage containers.

Metal
food & household products packaging, Americas

:

Consists of
operations in the U.S., Canada and Argentina, which manufacture and sell metal
food cans, aerosol cans, paint cans and decorative specialty cans.

Plastic
packaging, Americas

:

Consists of
operations in the U.S. and Canada (through most of the third quarter of 2008),
which manufacture and sell polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene
containers, primarily for use in beverage and food packaging. This segment also
includes the manufacture and sale of plastic containers used for industrial and
household products.

Aerospace
and technologies

:

Consists of the
manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and the providing
of services used primarily in the defense, civil space and commercial space
industries.

The
accounting policies of the segments are the same as those in the consolidated
financial statements. We also have investments in companies in the U.S., PRC and
Brazil, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and,
accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or
earnings.

3.  
Collateral Calls

In our
worldwide beverage can business, we use financial derivative contracts to manage
future aluminum price volatility for our customers. As these derivative
contracts are matched to customer sales contracts, they have little or no
economic impact on our earnings. Ball’s financial counterparties to these
derivative contracts require Ball to post collateral in certain circumstances
when the negative mark-to-market value of the contracts exceeds specified
levels. Additionally, Ball has similar collateral posting arrangements with
certain customers and financial counterparties on these derivative contracts. At
December 31, 2008, Ball had $229.5 million of cash posted as collateral and had
received $124 million of cash from customers for a net amount of $105.5 million.
The cash flows of the posted collateral calls are shown within the investing
section of our consolidated statements of cash flows. The majority of these
contracts settle during 2009.

4.  
Acquisitions


U.S.
Can Corporation

On
March 27, 2006, Ball acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of
U.S. Can Corporation (U.S. Can) for 444,756 common shares of Ball
Corporation (valued at $44.28 per share for a total of $19.7 million).
Contemporaneously with the acquisition, Ball also refinanced $598.2 million
of U.S. Can debt, including $26.8 million of bond redemption premiums and
fees, and the company expects to realize tax benefits of approximately
$44 million from acquired net operating tax loss and credit carryforwards
of which approximately $25 million have been realized as of
December 31, 2008. The acquired operations are included in the metal food
and household products packaging, Americas, segment, except for a plastic pail
product line that was transferred to the company’s plastic packaging, Americas,
segment effective January 1, 2007, for which 2006 amounts have been
retrospectively adjusted. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase
and, accordingly, its results have been included in the consolidated financial
statements since March 27, 2006.

Alcan
Packaging

On
March 28, 2006, Ball acquired North American plastic bottle container
assets from Alcan Packaging (Alcan) for $184.7 million cash. The acquired
business primarily manufactures and sells barrier polypropylene plastic bottles
used in food packaging and, to a lesser extent, barrier PET plastic bottles used
for beverages and food. The operations acquired form part of Ball’s plastic
packaging, Americas, segment. The acquisition has been accounted for as a
purchase and, accordingly, its results have been included in the consolidated
financial statements since March 28, 2006.

5.  
Legal Settlement

During
the second quarter of 2007, Miller Brewing Company (Miller), a U.S. customer,
asserted various claims against a wholly owned subsidiary of the company,
primarily related to the pricing of the aluminum component of the containers
supplied by the subsidiary, and on October 4, 2007, the dispute was settled in
mediation. Miller received $85.6 million ($51.8 million after tax) on
settlement of the dispute, and Ball retained all of Miller’s beverage can and
end supply through 2015. Miller received a one-time payment of approximately
$70.3 million ($42.5 million after tax) in January 2008 (recorded on
the December 31, 2007, consolidated balance sheet in other current
liabilities) with the remainder of the settlement to be recovered over the life
of the contract through 2015.

Metal
Beverage Packaging, Americas & Asia

On
October 30, 2008, the company announced the closure of two North American metal
beverage can plants. A plant in Kansas City, Missouri, which primarily
manufactures specialty beverage cans, will be closed by the end of the first
quarter of 2009 with manufacturing volumes absorbed by other North American
beverage can plants. A plant in Puerto Rico, which manufactured 12-ounce
beverage cans, was closed at the end of 2008. A pretax charge of
$40.7 million ($25.2 million after tax) was recorded in the fourth quarter
of 2008. The charge included $17 million for employee severance, pension and
other employment benefit costs; and $9 million of accelerated depreciation and
$14 million for the write down to net realizable value of certain fixed assets
and related spare parts. All remaining costs, excluding pension costs of $6
million, are expected to be incurred or paid during 2009. The carrying value of
fixed assets remaining for sale in connection with the plant closures was $5.5
million at December 31, 2008. An additional charge for accelerated
depreciation of $5 million ($3 million after tax) is expected to be recorded in
the first quarter of 2009.

On April
23, 2008, the company announced plans to close a U.S. metal beverage packaging
plant in Kent, Washington. A pretax charge of $11.2 million ($6.8 million after
tax) was recorded during the second and third quarters and included $9.2 million
for employee severance, pension and other employee benefit costs and
$2 million primarily related to accelerated depreciation and the write down
to net realizable value of certain fixed assets, related spare parts and tooling
inventory. The plant was shut down during the third quarter, and the land and
building was sold in the fourth quarter for a gain of $4.1 million ($2.5 million
after tax). All remaining costs, excluding pension costs of $5.2 million,
are expected to be incurred or paid during 2009.

A gain of
$7.2 million ($4.4 million after tax) was recorded in the second quarter for the
recovery of previously expensed costs in a prior metal beverage business
consolidation charge. This reflects a decision made in the second quarter to
continue to operate existing end-making equipment and not install a new beverage
can end module that would have been part of a multi-year project. The remaining
reserves are expected to be utilized in 2009 and 2010 as the multi-year U.S. end
modernization project is completed.

Metal
Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas

During
2008 the company recorded a net pretax gain of $1.6 million ($0.9 million after
tax) for business consolidation activities. In addition to costs recorded in the
fourth quarter of 2007, during the third quarter of 2008, a charge of $4.5
million ($2.8 million after tax) was recorded for lease cancellation costs on
final shutdown of the Commerce, California, facility. In the fourth quarter, a
$6.1 million ($3.7 million after tax) gain was recorded primarily related to
management’s decision in the fourth quarter to remain in the custom and
decorative tinplate can business based on market conditions. All remaining
reserves related to Commerce and Tallapoosa, Georgia (see 2007 discussion
below), excluding lease cancellation costs, are expected to be utilized during
2009. The carrying value of fixed assets remaining for sale in connection with
the plant closures was $3.1 million at December 31, 2008.

6.  
Business Consolidation and Other Costs

(continued)

Plastic
Packaging, Americas

In the
second quarter, the company announced plans to close a plastic packaging plant
in Brampton, Ontario. The plant manufactured polypropylene bottles for foods and
will be consolidated into the company’s other plastic packaging manufacturing
facilities in North America. A charge of $8.3 million ($7.8 million after
tax) was recorded during the second and third quarters. The charge included $1.9
million for severance costs, $2.5 million for lease cancellation costs and
$3.9 million for accelerated depreciation and the write down of fixed
assets to net realizable value. The plant was shut down during the third quarter
of 2008, and the remaining reserves are expected to be utilized during
2009.

Corporate
other costs

During
2008 pretax charges of $4.8 million ($2.9 million after tax) were recorded for
estimated environmental costs related to previously closed and sold
facilities.


Metal
Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas

In
October 2007 the company announced plans to close aerosol and general line can
manufacturing facilities in Commerce, California, and Tallapoosa, Georgia, and
to exit the custom and decorative tinplate can business located in Baltimore,
Maryland. A pretax charge of $41.9 million ($25.4 million after tax)
was recorded in the fourth quarter in connection with the closure of the aerosol
plants, including $10.7 million for severance costs, $23 million for
the write down of fixed assets to net realizable value, $2.4 million for
excess inventory and $5.8 million for other associated costs. The company’s
management has subsequently decided to remain in the custom and decorative
tinplate can business.

The
company also recorded a $2.3 million pretax pension annuity expense
($1.4 million after tax) related to a previously closed food can plant. The
pension settlement payment was made in December 2007.

Plastic
Packaging, Americas

In the
fourth quarter of 2007, Ball recorded a pretax charge of $0.4 million
($0.2 million after tax) for severance costs related to the termination of
approximately 50 employees in response to lost sales. All costs were
incurred and paid as of December 31, 2008.


Metal
Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas

In
October 2006 the company announced plans to close the Burlington, Ontario,
and Alliance, Ohio, plants as part of the realignment of the metal food and
household products packaging, Americas, segment following the acquisition
earlier in the year of U.S. Can. A charge of $33.6 million
($27.4 million after tax) was recorded in the fourth

quarter
related to the Burlington closure. Payments of $1.8 million were made in
2008 against the reserves and the Burlington facility was sold in the third
quarter of 2008. The remaining reserves related to employee costs are expected
to be paid during the first quarter of 2009. The closure of the Ohio plant,
estimated to cost approximately $1 million for employee and other costs, was
treated as an opening balance sheet item related to the acquisition and all
costs were incurred and paid as of December 31, 2007.

Business Consolidation and Other Costs

(continued)

Also in
2006 a net charge of $1.9 million ($1.3 million after tax) was
recorded primarily to reduce metal food can production in Canada and record the
recovery of business consolidation costs previously expensed. All costs were
incurred and paid as of the end of 2007.

Sale of Subsidiary

On
February 15, 2008, Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. (BATC) completed the
sale of its shares in Ball Solutions Group Pty Ltd (BSG) for approximately $10.5
million, including $1.8 million of cash sold. BSG was previously a wholly
owned Australian subsidiary of BATC that provided services to the Australian
department of defense and related government agencies. After an adjustment for
working capital items, the sale resulted in a pretax gain of $7.1 million ($4.4
million after tax).

8.  
Property Insurance Gain

On
April 1, 2006, a fire in the Hassloch, Germany, metal beverage can plant in
the company’s metal beverage packaging, Europe, segment damaged a significant
portion of the plant’s building and machinery and equipment. The property
insurance proceeds recorded for the combined years ended December 31, 2007
and 2006, which were based on replacement cost, were €86.3 million
($109.9 million). A €26.7 million ($33.8 million) fixed asset
write down was recorded in 2006 to reflect the estimated impairment of the
assets damaged as a result of the fire. As a result, a pretax gain of
€59.6 million ($75.5 million) was recorded in the 2006 consolidated
statement of earnings to reflect the difference between the net book value of
the impaired assets and the property insurance proceeds. An additional
€27.2 million ($35.1 million) and €40 million ($51 million)
were recorded in cost of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively, for insurance
recoveries related to business interruption costs, as well as €11.3 million
($14.3 million) in 2006 to offset clean-up costs.

Trade
accounts receivable are shown net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of
$12.8 million at December 31, 2008, and $13.2 million at
December 31, 2007. Other receivables primarily include property and sales
tax receivables and certain vendor rebate receivables.

A
receivables sales agreement provides for the ongoing, revolving sale of a
designated pool of trade accounts receivable of Ball’s North American packaging
operations up to $250 million. The agreement qualifies as off-balance sheet
financing under the provisions of SFAS No. 140, as amended by
SFAS No. 156. Net funds received from the sale of the accounts
receivable totaled $250 million and $170 million at December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively, and are reflected as a reduction of accounts
receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. Fees incurred in connection with
the sale of accounts receivable, which are reported as part of selling, general
and administrative expenses, totaled $8.5 million in 2008,
$11.4 million in 2007 and $9.7 million in 2006.

Net
accounts receivable under long-term contracts, due primarily from agencies of
the U.S. government and their prime contractors, were $136 million for each
of the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, and included
$55 million and $48.1 million, respectively, representing the
recognized sales value of performance that had not been billed and was not yet
billable to customers. The average length of the long-term contracts is
approximately four years and the average length remaining on those
contracts at December 31, 2008, was 16 months. Approximately
$0.5 million of unbilled receivables at December 31, 2008, is
expected to be collected after one year and is related to customary fees and
cost withholdings that will be paid upon milestone or contract completions, as
well as final overhead rate settlements.

Leases

The
company leases warehousing and manufacturing space and certain equipment in the
packaging segments and office and technical space in the aerospace and
technologies segment. During 2005 and 2003, we entered into leases that qualify
as operating leases for book purposes and capital leases for tax purposes. Under
these lease arrangements, Ball has the option to purchase the leased equipment
at the end of the lease term, or if we elect not to do so, to compensate the
lessors for the difference between the guaranteed minimum residual values
totaling $16.3 million and the fair market value of the assets, if less.
Certain of the company’s leases in effect at December 31, 2008, include
renewal options and/or escalation clauses for adjusting lease expense based on
various factors.

Total
noncancellable operating leases in effect at December 31, 2008, require rental
payments of $46.7 million, $37.5 million, $28.5 million,
$20.5 million and $16.2 million for the years 2009 through 2013,
respectively, and $37.9 million combined for all years thereafter. Lease
expense for all operating leases was $84.2 million, $85.3 million and
$83.1 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The
senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and also include

long-term revolving credit facility that provides the company with up to the
equivalent of $35 million. Both revolving credit facilities expire in
October 2011. At December 31, 2008, taking into account outstanding
letters of credit, $502 million was available under these revolving credit
facilities.

Long-term
debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2008, have maturities of
$147.4 million, $364 million, $776.5 million, $509.4 million
and $0.4 million for the years ending December 31, 2009 through 2013,
respectively, and $455.7 million thereafter. Ball provides letters of
credit in the ordinary course of business to secure liabilities recorded in
connection with industrial development revenue bonds and certain self-insurance
arrangements. Letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007, were
$34.9 million and $41 million, including industrial development bonds
of $9.4 million and $13 million, respectively.

The lower
tax rate in 2007 as compared to 2008 and 2006 was primarily the result of
earnings mix (higher foreign earnings taxed at lower rates) and net tax benefit
adjustments of $17.2 million recorded in 2007. Additionally, the inability to
fully use Canadian net operating losses on plant closures in 2008 and 2006
contributed to higher rates in those years. The 2008 rate was partially reduced
by a $4.5 million tax benefit recognized during the third quarter of 2008 for a
law that was enacted, which changed the treatment of statutory tax depreciation
in the United Kingdom. This was offset by the impact of non-deductible losses in
the cash surrender value of certain company-owned life insurance plans. The
$17.2 million net reduction in the 2007 tax provision was primarily a result of
income tax rate reductions enacted in Germany and the United Kingdom and a tax
loss related to the company’s Canadian operations, which were offset by an
increase in the tax provision in 2007 to adjust for the final settlement
negotiations concluded with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to a
company-owned life insurance plan.

In 1995
Ball Packaging Europe’s Polish subsidiary was granted a tax holiday. Under the
terms of the holiday, an exemption was granted on manufacturing earnings for up
to €39.5 million of income tax. The tax exemption was fully utilized as of
December 31, 2007. In 2005 Ball Packaging Europe’s Serbian subsidiary was
granted a tax holiday. Under the terms of the holiday, the earnings of this
subsidiary are exempt from income taxation for a period of 10 years
beginning in the first year the Serbian subsidiary has taxable earnings. As of
December 31, 2008, the 10-year period had commenced and seven years
remain.

Net
income tax payments were $120.3 million, $63.6 million and
$138.6 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The
change in deferred taxes during 2008 is primarily attributable to the increase

At
December 31, 2008, Ball Corporation and its domestic subsidiaries had net
operating loss carryforwards, expiring between 2021 and 2026, of
$32.7 million with a related tax benefit of $13.6 million. Also at
December 31, 2008, Ball Packaging Europe and its subsidiaries had net
operating loss carryforwards, with no expiration date, of $48.4 million
with a related tax benefit of $11.2 million. Ball’s Canadian subsidiaries
had a net operating loss carryforward, with no expiration date, of
$38.4 million with a related tax benefit of $12.1 million. Due to the
uncertainty of ultimate realization, these European and Canadian benefits have
been offset by valuation allowances of $8.7 million and $11.5 million,
respectively. At December 31, 2008, the company has alternative minimum tax
credit carryforwards of $5.1 million and foreign tax credit carryforwards of
$5.8 million; however, due to the uncertainty of realization of the entire
foreign tax credit, a valuation allowance of $3.8 million has been applied
to reduce the carrying value to $2 million.

The 2008
provision for income taxes included an $8.7 million accrual under
FIN No. 48 compared to $11.5 million accrued in 2007. The
majority of the 2007 FIN No. 48 provision was related to the effective
settlement during the third quarter of 2007 with the Internal Revenue Service
for interest deductions on incurred loans from a company-owned life insurance
plan.

The
amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008, that, if
recognized, would reduce tax expense is $44.3 million. At this time there
are no positions where the unrecognized tax benefit is expected to increase or
decrease significantly within the next 12 months. U.S. Federal and state
income tax returns filed for the years 2000-2007 are open for audit, with an
effective settlement of the Federal returns through 2004. The income tax returns
filed in Europe for the years 2002 through 2007 are also open for audit. The
company’s significant filings in Europe are in Germany, France, the Netherlands,
Poland, Serbia and the United Kingdom.

The
company recognizes the accrual of interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits in income tax expense. Ball recognized $3.1 million and
$2.7 million of additional income tax expense in 2008 and 2007,
respectively, for potential interest on these items.

The accrual for uncertain
tax positions at December 31, 2008, includes approximately $8 million
representing potential interest expense. No penalties have been
accrued.

Management’s
intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed foreign earnings of Ball’s
controlled foreign corporations and, as a result, no U.S. income or foreign
withholding tax provision has been made. It is not practicable to estimate the
additional taxes that may become payable upon the eventual remittance of these
foreign earnings.

Certain
management employees may elect to defer the payment of all or a portion of their
annual incentive compensation into the company’s deferred compensation plan
and/or the company’s deferred compensation stock plan. The employee becomes a
general unsecured creditor of the company with respect to amounts deferred.
Amounts deferred into the deferred compensation stock plan receive a
20 percent company match with a maximum match of $20,000 per year. Amounts
deferred into the stock plan are represented in the participant's account as
stock units, with each unit having a value equivalent to one share of Ball’s
common stock. Beginning in 2007, participants in the stock plan were allowed to
reallocate a prescribed number of units to other notional investment funds
subject to specified time constraints.

The
company

’

s
pension plans cover substantially all U.S., Canadian and European employees
meeting certain eligibility requirements. The defined benefit plans for salaried
employees, as well as those for hourly employees in Germany and the United
Kingdom, provide pension benefits based on employee compensation and years of
service. Plans for North American hourly employees provide benefits based on
fixed rates for each year of service. While the German plans are not funded, the
company maintains book reserves, and annual additions to the reserves are
generally tax deductible. With the exception of the German plans, our policy is
to fund the plans in amounts at least sufficient to satisfy statutory funding
requirements taking into consideration what is currently deductible under
existing tax laws and regulations.

Current
financial accounting standards require that the discount rates used to calculate
the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit
obligations reflect the time value of money as of the measurement date of
the benefit obligation and reflect the rates of return currently available on
high quality fixed income securities whose cash flows (via coupons and
maturities) match the timing and amount of future benefit payments of the plan.
In addition changes in the discount rate assumption should reflect changes in
the general level of interest rates.

In
selecting the U.S. discount rate for December 31, 2008, several benchmarks
were considered, including Moody's long-term corporate bond yield for Aa
bonds and the Citigroup Pension Liability Index. In addition the expected cash
flows from the plans were modeled relative to the Citigroup Pension Discount
Curve and matched to cash flows from a portfolio of bonds rated Aa or
better. When determining the appropriate discount rate, the company
contemplated the impact of lump sum payment options under its U.S. plans when
considering the appropriate yield curve. In Canada the markets for locally
denominated high-quality, longer term corporate bonds are relatively thin. As a
result, the approach taken in Canada was to use yield curve spot rates to
discount the respective benefit cash flows and to compute the underlying
constant bond yield equivalent. The Canadian discount rate at December 31,
2008, was selected based on a review of the expected benefit payments for each
of the Canadian defined benefit plans over the next 60 years and then
discounting the resulting cash flows to the measurement date using the AA
corporate bond spot rates to determine the equivalent level discount rate. In
the United Kingdom and Germany, the company and its actuarial consultants
considered the applicable iBoxx 15+ year AA corporate bond yields for the
respective markets and determined a rate consistent with those expectations. In
all countries, the discount rates selected for December 31, 2008, were
based on the range of values obtained from cash flow specific methods,
together with the changes in the general level of interest rates reflected by
the benchmarks.

The
assumption related to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide
for the benefits over the life of the plans. The assumption was based upon
Ball’s pension plan asset allocations, investment strategies and the views of
investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Some reliance was
placed on historical asset returns of our plans. An asset-return generation
model was used to project future asset returns using simulation and asset class
correlation. The analysis included expected future risk premiums,
forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds
and the price earnings ratios of major stock market indexes, expected inflation
and real risk-free interest rate assumptions and the fund’s expected asset
allocation.

The
expected long-term rates of return on assets were calculated by applying the
expected rate of return to a market related value of plan assets at the
beginning of the year, adjusted for the weighted average expected contributions
and benefit payments. The market related value of plan assets used to calculate
expected return was $1,052.4 million for 2008, $853 million for 2007
and $780.7 million for 2006.

Included
in other comprehensive earnings, net of the related tax effect, was an increase
in pension and other postretirement item obligations of $147.8 million in 2008
and decreases in pension and other postretirement item obligations of
$57.9 million and $55.9 million in 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

For
pension plans, accumulated gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent
corridor and the prior service cost are amortized over the average remaining
service period of active participants.

Defined
Benefit Pension Plan Assets

Investment
policies and strategies for the plan assets in the U.S., Canada and the United
Kingdom are established by pension investment committees of the company and its
relevant subsidiaries and include the following common themes: (1) to provide
for long-term growth of principal income without undue exposure to risk, (2) to
minimize contributions to the plans, (3) to minimize and stabilize pension
expense and (4) to achieve a rate of return above the market average for each
asset class over the long term. The pension investment committees are required
to regularly, but no less frequently than once annually, review asset mix and
asset performance, as well as the performance of the investment managers. Based
on their reviews, which are generally conducted quarterly, investment policies
and strategies are revised as appropriate.

This estimate may change based on changes in the Pension Protection Act and
actual plan asset performance, among other factors. Benefit payments related to
these plans are expected to be $69.5 million, $73.7 million,
$76.4 million, $81 million and $84.5 million for the years ending
December 31, 2009 through 2013, respectively, and a total of $482.7 million
for the years 2014 through 2018. Payments to participants in the unfunded German
plans are expected to be approximately $24 million to $25 million in each
of the years 2009 through 2013 and a total of $125.6 million for the years
2014 through 2018.

Other
Postemployment Benefits

The
company sponsors defined benefit and defined contribution postretirement health
care and life insurance plans for substantially all U.S. and Canadian employees.
Employees may also qualify for long-term disability, medical and life insurance
continuation and other postemployment benefits upon termination of active
employment prior to retirement. All of the Ball-sponsored postretirement health
care and life insurance plans are unfunded and, with the exception of life
insurance benefits, are self-insured.

In
Canada, the company provides supplemental medical and other benefits in
conjunction with Canadian provincial health care plans. Most U.S. salaried
employees who retired prior to 1993 are covered by noncontributory defined
benefit medical plans with capped lifetime benefits. Ball provides a fixed
subsidy toward each retiree

’

s future purchase
of medical insurance for U.S. salaried and substantially all nonunion hourly
employees retiring after January 1, 1993. Life insurance benefits are
noncontributory. Ball has no commitments to increase benefits provided by any of
the postemployment benefit plans.

The
estimated net loss and prior service cost for the other postretirement plans
that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net
periodic benefit cost during 2009 are $0.4 million and $0.3 million,
respectively.

The
assumptions used for the determination of benefit obligations and net periodic
benefit cost were the same as those used for the U.S. and Canadian defined
benefit pension plans. For other postretirement benefits, accumulated gains and
losses, the prior service cost and the transition asset are amortized over the
average remaining service period of active participants.

For the
U.S. health care plans at December 31, 2008, a 9 percent health care
cost trend rate was used for pre-65 and post-65 benefits, and trend rates were
assumed to decrease to 5 percent in 2013 and remain at that level
thereafter.  For the Canadian plans, a 9 percent health care cost
trend rate was used, which was assumed to decrease to 5 percent by 2017 and
remain at that level in subsequent years.

Health
care cost trend rates can have an effect on the amounts reported for the health
care plan. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates
would increase or decrease the total of service and interest cost by
$0.3 million and the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately
$4.3 million to $4.8 million.

Other
Benefit Plans

Through
December 31, 2006, the company matched employee contributions to the 401(k)
plan with shares of Ball common stock up to 50 percent of up to
6 percent of a participant’s annual salary. Effective January 1, 2007,
the company matches U.S. salaried employee contributions with shares of Ball
common stock up to 100 percent of the first 3 percent of a
participant’s salary plus 50 percent of the next 2 percent. The
expense associated with the company match amounted to $20.7 million,
$20.8 million and $16.1 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

In
addition substantially all employees within the company’s aerospace and
technologies segment who participate in Ball’s 401(k) plan receive a
performance-based matching cash contribution of up to 4 percent of base
salary.  The company recognized $8.4 million and
$8.7 million of additional compensation expense related to this program for
the years 2008 and 2007, respectively. There was no matching contribution for
the year ended December 31, 2006.

In 2008
the company’s 401(k) plan matching contributions could not exceed $9,200 per
employee and the limit on employee contributions was $15,500 per
employee.

18.  
Shareholders’ Equity

At
December 31, 2008, the company had 550 million shares of common stock and
15 million shares of preferred stock authorized, both without par value.
Preferred stock includes 550,000 authorized but unissued shares designated as
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

Under the
company

’

s
shareholder Rights Agreement dated July 26, 2006, as amended, one preferred
stock purchase right (Right) is attached to each outstanding share of Ball
Corporation common stock. Subject to adjustment, each Right entitles the
registered holder to purchase from the company one one-thousandth of a share of
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $185 per
Right. Subject to certain limited exceptions for passive investors, if a person
or group acquires 10 percent or more of the company's outstanding common
stock (or upon occurrence of certain other events), the Rights (other than those
held by the acquiring person) become exercisable and generally entitle the
holder to purchase shares of Ball Corporation common stock at a 50 percent
discount. The Rights, which expire in 2016, are redeemable by the company at a
redemption price of $0.001 cent per Right and trade with the common stock.
Exercise of such Rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group
attempting to acquire control of the company without the approval of Ball

’

s board of
directors. The Rights would not interfere with any merger or other business
combinations approved by the board of directors.

The
company increased its share repurchase program in 2008 to $299.6 million,
net of issuances, compared to $211.3 million net repurchases in 2007 and
$45.7 million in 2006. The net repurchases in 2008 included a $31 million
settlement on January 7, 2008, of a forward contract entered into in December
2007 for the repurchase of 675,000 shares. Additionally, in 2007 net repurchases
included a $51.9 million settlement on January 5, 2007, of a forward
contract entered into in December 2006 for the repurchase of
1,200,000 shares.

On
December 12, 2007, in a privately negotiated transaction, Ball entered into
an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy $100 million of its common
shares using cash on hand and available borrowings. The company advanced the
$100 million on January 7, 2008, and received 2,038,657 shares,
which represented 90 percent of the total shares as calculated using the
previous day’s closing price. The agreement was settled on July 11, 2008, and
the company received an additional 138,521 shares.

In
connection with the employee stock purchase plan, the company contributes
20 percent of up to $500 of each participating employee’s monthly payroll
deduction toward the purchase of Ball Corporation common stock. Company
contributions for this plan were $3.2 million each in 2008, 2007 and
2006.

ithin the
      company’s 2006 annual report, the consolidated statement of changes in
      shareholders’ equity for the year ended December 31, 2006, included a
      transition adjustment of $47.9 million, net of tax, related to the
      adoption of SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
      Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of FASB
      Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),” as a component of 2006
      comprehensive earnings rather than only as an adjustment to accumulated
      other comprehensive loss. The 2006 amounts have been revised to correct
      the previous reporting.

Management’s
intention is to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings. Therefore, no taxes have
been provided on the foreign currency translation component for any period. The
change in the pension and other postretirement items is presented net of a
related tax benefit of $93.9 million for 2008 and related tax expense of
$31.3 million and $2.9 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
change in the effective financial derivatives is presented net of related tax
benefit of $42.5 million for 2008, related tax benefit of $3.2 million
for 2007 and related tax expense of $5.7 million for 2006.

The
pension and other postretirement items component of other comprehensive loss
increased significantly in 2008 due to poor stock market performance causing
lower than expected pension plan assets (presented in further detail in Note
17).

Stock-Based
Compensation Programs

The
company has shareholder-approved stock option plans under which options to
purchase shares of Ball common stock have been granted to officers and employees
at the market value of the stock at the date of grant. Payment must be made at
the time of exercise in cash or with shares of stock owned by the option holder,
which are valued at fair market value on the date exercised. In general, options
are exercisable in four equal installments commencing one year from the date of
grant and terminating 10 years from the date of grant. A summary of stock option
activity for the year ended December 31, 2008, follows:

The
options granted in April 2008 included 384,995 stock-settled stock
appreciation rights, which have the same terms as the stock options. The
weighted average remaining contractual term for all options outstanding at
December 31, 2008, was six years and the aggregate intrinsic value
(difference in exercise price and closing price at that date) was
$30.7 million. The weighted average remaining contractual term for options
vested and exercisable at December 31, 2008, was 4.5 years and the
aggregate intrinsic value was $44 million. The company received
$6.7 million from options exercised during 2008. The intrinsic value
associated with these exercises was $9.8 million, and the associated tax
benefit reported as other financing activities in the consolidated statement of
cash flows was $4.3 million. The total fair value of options vested during 2008,
2007 and 2006 was $6 million, $5 million and $4.8 million,
respectively.

These
options cannot be traded in any equity market. However, based on the
Black-Scholes option pricing model, adapted for use in valuing compensatory
stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), options granted in
2008, 2007 and 2006 have estimated weighted average fair values at the date of
grant of $12.82 per share, $11.22 per share and $10.46 per share,
respectively. The actual value an employee may realize will depend on the excess
of the stock price over the exercise price on the date the option is exercised.
Consequently, there is no assurance that the value realized by an employee will
be at or near the value estimated. The fair values were estimated using the
following weighted average assumptions:

Shareholders’ Equity

(continued)

In
addition to stock options, the company issues to officers and certain employees
restricted shares and restricted stock units, which vest over various periods.
Other than the performance-contingent grants discussed below, such restricted
shares and restricted stock units generally vest in equal installments over five
years. Compensation cost is recorded based upon the fair value of the shares at
the grant date.

To
encourage certain senior management employees and outside directors to invest in
Ball stock, Ball adopted a deposit share program in March 2001 (subsequently
amended and restated in April 2004) that matches purchased shares with
restricted shares. In general, restrictions on the matching shares lapse at the
end of four years from date of grant, or earlier in stages if established share
ownership guidelines are met, assuming the relevant qualifying purchased shares
are not sold or transferred prior to that time. Grants under the plan are
accounted for as equity awards and compensation expense is recorded based upon
the closing market price of the shares at the grant date.

The
company recorded $3.8 million, $6.5 million and $6.7 million of
expense in connection with this program in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

In
April 2008 and 2007, the company’s board of directors granted
246,650 and 170,000 performance-contingent restricted stock units,
respectively, to key employees, which will cliff-vest if the company’s return on
average invested capital during a 36-month performance period and 33-month
performance period, respectively, is equal to or exceeds the company’s cost of
capital. If the performance goals are not met, the shares will be forfeited.
Current assumptions are that the performance targets will be met and,
accordingly, grants under the plan are being accounted for as equity awards and
compensation expense is recorded based upon the closing market price of the
shares at the grant date. On a quarterly basis, the company reassesses the
probability of the goals being met and adjusts compensation expense as
appropriate. No such adjustment was considered necessary at the end of 2008 for
either grant. The expense associated with the performance-contingent grants
totaled $6.2 million and $2.2 million in 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

For the
years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the company recognized in
selling, general and administrative expenses pretax expense of
$20.5 million ($12.4 million after tax) and $15.9 million
($9.6 million after tax) and $12.9 million ($7.8 million after tax),
respectively, for share-based compensation arrangements. These amounts
represented $0.13 per both basic and diluted share in 2008, $0.10 per
basic share and $0.09 per diluted share in 2007, respectively, and $0.08 per
basic share and $0.07 per diluted share in 2006, respectively. At
December 31, 2008, there was $37.5 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements.
This cost is expected to be recognized in earnings over a weighted average
period of 2.3 years.

20.  
Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Ball
adopted SFAS No. 157 effective January 1, 2008, for financial
assets and liabilities and for nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured on a
recurring basis. As discussed in Note 1, SFAS No. 157 establishes
a framework for measuring value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. Although it does not require any new fair value measurements, the
statement emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an
entity-specific measurement, and should be determined based on the assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As defined
in SFAS No. 157, fair value is the price that would be received to
sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). However, it
permits a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask
prices) as a practical expedient. SFAS No. 157 requires that the fair
value of a liability include the nonperformance risk (including an entity’s
credit risk and other risks such as settlement risk) related to the liability
being measured.

20.  
Fair Value of Financial Instruments

(continued)

The
statement establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to
measure fair value using the following definitions (from highest to lowest
priority):

●

Level 1
      – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the
      measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
      Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments, such as
      exchange-traded derivatives and listed equity
  securities.

●

Level 2
      – Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are
      observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term
      of the asset or liability. Level 2 includes those financial
      instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.
      These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various
      assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value,
      volatility factors and current market and contractual prices for the
      underlying instruments. Substantially all of these assumptions are
      observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument,
      can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels
      at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this
      category include non-exchange-traded derivatives, such as over-the-counter
      forwards and options.

●

Level 3
      – Prices or valuation techniques requiring inputs that are both
      significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e.,
      supported by little or no market
activity).

As
summarized in the following table, the company has classified all financial
assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities accounted for at
fair value on a recurring basis as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy as of
December 31, 2008. The company’s assessment of the significance of a particular
input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the
valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the
fair value hierarchy levels.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

(continued)

The
company uses closing spot and forward market prices as published by the London
Metal Exchange, the New York Metal Exchange, Reuters and Bloomberg to determine
the fair value of its aluminum, currency, energy and interest rate spot and
forward contracts. Option contracts are valued using a Black-Scholes model
with observable market inputs for aluminum, currency and interest rates. We do
not obtain multiple quotes to determine the value for our financial instruments,
as we value each of our financial instruments either internally using a single
valuation technique or from one reliable observable market source. The company
also does not adjust the value of its financial instruments except for in
determining the fair value of a trade that settles in the future by discounting
the value to its present value using 12-month LIBOR as the discount factor. We
perform validations of our internally derived fair values reported for our
financial instruments on a quarterly basis utilizing counterparty statements.
The company additionally evaluates counterparty creditworthiness and has not
identified any circumstances requiring that the reported values of our financial
instruments be adjusted as of December 31, 2008.

For the
year ended December 31, 2008, the company recorded a net pretax gain of
$3.9 million for the changes in the fair value of its derivative
instruments.

21.  
Financial Instruments and Risk Management

Policies
and Procedures

In the
ordinary course of business, we employ established risk management policies and
procedures, which seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity
prices, interest rates, foreign currencies and prices of the company’s common
stock in regard to common share repurchases, although there can be no assurance
that these policies and procedures will be successful. Although the instruments
utilized involve varying degrees of credit, market and interest risk, the
counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms
of the agreements. The company monitors counterparty credit risk, including
lenders, on a regular basis, but we cannot be certain that all risks will be
discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be
effective.

Commodity
Price Risk

We manage
our North American commodity price risk in connection with market price
fluctuations of aluminum ingot primarily by entering into container sales
contracts that include aluminum ingot-based pricing terms that generally reflect
price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum sheet
purchases. The terms include fixed, floating or pass-through aluminum ingot
component pricing. This matched pricing affects most of our North American metal
beverage packaging net sales. We also, at times, use certain derivative
instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow and fair value
hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass-through arrangement in
the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales
volumes and pricing.

Most of
the plastic packaging, Americas, sales contracts include provisions to fully
pass through resin cost changes. As a result, we believe we have minimal
exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin. Most metal food and
household products packaging, Americas, sales contracts either include
provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we
incur, or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs. In 2008 and 2007, we
were able to pass through to our customers the majority of steel cost increases.
We anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of
the steel price increases that occur over the next 12 months.

21.  
Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued)

In Europe
and the PRC, the company manages the aluminum and steel raw material commodity
price risks through annual and long-term contracts for the purchase of the
materials, as well as certain sales of containers, that reduce the company’s
exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year. These
purchase and sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass-through
pricing arrangements. We also use forward and option contracts as cash flow
hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures to
match underlying purchased volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing
for those sales contracts where there is not a pass-through arrangement to
minimize the company’s exposure to significant price changes.

The
company had aluminum contracts limiting its aluminum exposure with notional
amounts of approximately $1.4 billion and $1 billion at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The aluminum contracts include
derivative instruments for which the company elects mark-to-market accounting,
as well as cash flow and fair value hedges that offset sales contracts of
various terms and lengths. Cash flow and fair value hedges related to forecasted
transactions and firm commitments expire within the next four years.

Included in
shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2008, within accumulated other
comprehensive earnings is a net after-tax loss of $100 million associated
with these contracts. However, a net loss of $63 million is expected to be
recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the next 12 months,
which will be passed through to customers by higher revenue from sales contracts
resulting in no earnings impact to Ball. The consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2008, included $183.7 million in other current assets,
$137.2 million in long-term other assets, $264.8 million in current
liabilities and $175.5 million in long-term liabilities related to unrealized
gains/losses on unsettled commodity derivative contracts. The consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2007, included $32 million in other
current assets and $50.2 million in current liabilities for these
gains/losses.

During
the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a pretax charge of $11.5 million for
mark-to-market losses related to aluminum derivative instruments, which were no
longer deemed highly effective for hedge accounting purposes.

Interest
Rate Risk

Our
objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the
impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our
overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we use a variety of
interest rate swaps, collars and options to manage our mix of floating and
fixed-rate debt. Interest rate instruments held by the company at
December 31, 2008, included pay-fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate
collars. Pay-fixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed
rate instruments. Collars create an upper and lower threshold within which
interest rates will fluctuate.

At
December 31, 2008, the company had outstanding interest rate swap
agreements in Europe with notional amounts of €135 million paying fixed
rates expiring within the next three years. An approximate $7 million net
after-tax loss associated with these contracts is included in accumulated other
comprehensive earnings at December 31, 2008, of which $4 million is
expected to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the
next 12 months. At December 31, 2008, the company had outstanding interest
rate collars in the U.S. totaling $150 million. Ball additionally has $100
million of forward rate agreements expiring in less than three months. The value
of these contracts in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at
December 31, 2008, was insignificant. Approximately $3.5 million of
net gain related to the termination or deselection of hedges is included in
accumulated other comprehensive earnings at December 31, 2008. The amount
recognized in 2008 earnings related to terminated hedges was
insignificant.

We also
use European inflation option contracts to limit the impacts from spikes in
inflation against certain multi-year contracts. At December 31, 2008, the
company had inflation options in Europe with notional amounts of
€115 million. The company uses mark-to-market accounting for these options,
and the fair value at December 31, 2008, was €0.6 million. The
contracts expire within the next five years.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management

(continued)

The
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008, included $1.9 million
in current liabilities and $8.3 million in long-term liabilities related to
unrealized gains/losses on unsettled interest rate instruments. The consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2007, included $6.7 million in other
current assets and $0.1 million in current liabilities for these
gains/losses.

The fair
value of all non-derivative financial instruments approximates their carrying
amounts with the exception of long-term debt. Rates currently available to the
company for loans with similar terms and maturities are used to estimate the
fair value of long-term debt based on discounted cash flows. The fair value of
derivatives generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay or
receive upon termination of the contracts at December 31, taking into
account any unrealized gains and losses on open contracts.

Foreign
Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Our
objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect
foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency
exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts. In
addition we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of
foreign currency option strategies, and the change in the fair value of those
options is recorded in the company’s quarterly earnings. Our foreign currency
translation risk results from the European euro, British pound, Canadian dollar,
Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Hong Kong dollar, Brazilian real, Argentine peso
and Serbian dinar. We face currency exposures in our global operations as a
result of purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars and, to a lesser extent, in
other currencies. Sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost
changes and, where there is not a foreign exchange pass-through arrangement, the
company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures.
We additionally use various option strategies to manage the earnings translation
of the company’s European operations into U.S. dollars. Such contracts
outstanding at December 31, 2008, expire within two years, and the amounts
included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to these contracts
were not significant. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008,
included $13.3 million in other current assets, $1.8 million in long-term
other assets, $0.6 million in current liabilities and $5.7 million in
long-term liabilities related to unrealized gains/losses on unsettled foreign
exchange rate contracts. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31,
2007, included $0.4 million in other current assets and $1.9 million
in liabilities for these gains/losses.

Research and Development

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred in connection with the company’s
internal programs for the development of products and processes. Costs incurred
in connection with these programs, the majority of which are included in cost of
sales, amounted to $32.9 million, $27.4 million and $22.5 million
for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

24.  
Subsidiary Guarantees of Debt

As
discussed in Note 15, the company’s notes payable and senior credit
facilities are guaranteed on a full, unconditional and joint and several basis
by certain of the company’s domestic wholly owned subsidiaries. Certain foreign
denominated tranches of the senior credit facilities are similarly guaranteed by
certain of the company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. The senior credit
facilities are secured by: (1) a pledge of 100 percent of the stock owned
by the company in its material direct and indirect majority-owned domestic
subsidiaries and (2) a pledge of the company’s stock, owned directly or
indirectly, of certain foreign subsidiaries, which equals 65 percent of the
stock of each such foreign subsidiary. The following is condensed, consolidating
financial information (in millions of dollars) for the company, segregating the
guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2008
and 2007, and for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.
Separate financial statements for the guarantor subsidiaries and the
non-guarantor subsidiaries are not presented, because management has determined
that such financial statements would not be material to investors.

25.  
Contingencies

The
company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of
business due, in part, to the competitive nature of the industries in which the
company participates. We do business in countries outside the U.S., have
changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our
packaging products and participate in changing capital markets. We attempt to
reduce these risks and uncertainties through the establishment of risk
management policies and procedures, including, at times, the use of certain
derivative financial instruments.

From time
to time, the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its
businesses. Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has
designated Ball as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other
companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Our information at
this time does not indicate that the matters identified will have a material
adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition
of the company.

Pursuant
to the merger agreement with the former shareholders of U.S. Can, a certain
portion of the common share consideration issued for the acquisition of U.S. Can
was placed in escrow and was subsequently converted into cash, which was to be
used for the settlement of certain post-acquisition claims, pursuant to the
terms of the merger agreement. During the second quarter of 2007, Ball asserted
claims against the former shareholders of U.S. Can, which were disputed. The
representative for the former shareholders of U.S. Can filed a lawsuit against
the company in the first quarter of 2008 seeking a declaration of the parties’
rights and obligations with respect to the claims asserted by the company. This
matter was settled during the fourth quarter of 2008.

26.  
Indemnifications and Guarantees

During
the normal course of business, the company or its appropriate consolidated
direct or indirect subsidiaries have made certain indemnities, commitments and
guarantees under which the specified entity may be required to make payments in
relation to certain transactions. These indemnities, commitments and guarantees
include indemnities to the customers of the subsidiaries in connection with the
sales of their packaging and aerospace products and services; guarantees to
suppliers of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the company guaranteeing the
performance of the respective entity under a purchase agreement, construction
contract or other commitment; guarantees in respect of certain foreign
subsidiaries’ pension plans; indemnities for liabilities associated with the
infringement of third party patents, trademarks or copyrights under various
types of agreements; indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility,
equipment, furniture and other personal property leases for certain claims
arising from such leases; indemnities to governmental agencies in connection
with the issuance of a permit or license to the company or a subsidiary;
indemnities pursuant to agreements relating to certain joint ventures;
indemnities in connection with the sale of businesses or substantially all of
the assets and specified liabilities of businesses; and indemnities to
directors, officers and employees of the company to the extent permitted under
the laws of the State of Indiana and the United States of America. The duration
of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases,
is indefinite. In addition the majority of these indemnities, commitments and
guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential future
payments the company could be obligated to make. As such, the company is unable
to reasonably estimate its potential exposure under these items.

The
company has not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and
guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The company does,
however, accrue for payments under promissory notes and other evidences of
incurred indebtedness and for losses for any known contingent liability,
including those that may arise from indemnifications, commitments and
guarantees, when future payment is both reasonably determinable and probable.
Finally, the company carries specific and general liability insurance policies
and has obtained indemnities, commitments and guarantees from third party
purchasers, sellers and other contracting parties, which the company believes
would, in certain circumstances, provide recourse to any claims arising from
these indemnifications, commitments and guarantees.

Indemnifications and Guarantees

(continued)

The
company’s senior notes and senior credit facilities are guaranteed on a full,
unconditional and joint and several basis by certain of the company’s wholly
owned domestic subsidiaries. Foreign tranches of the senior credit facilities
are similarly guaranteed by certain of the company’s wholly owned foreign
subsidiaries. These guarantees are required in support of the notes and credit
facilities referred to above, are co-terminous with the terms of the respective
note indentures and credit agreements and would require performance upon certain
events of default referred to in the respective guarantees. The maximum
potential amounts which could be required to be paid under the guarantees are
essentially equal to the then outstanding principal and interest under the
respective notes and credit agreement, or under the applicable tranche. The
company is not in default under the above notes or credit
facilities.

Ball
Capital Corp. II is a separate, wholly owned corporate entity created for the
purchase of receivables from certain of the company’s wholly owned subsidiaries.
Ball Capital Corp. II’s assets will be available first to satisfy the claims of
its creditors. The company has provided an undertaking to Ball Capital Corp. II
in support of the sale of receivables to a commercial lender or lenders who
would require performance upon certain events of default referred to in the
undertaking. The maximum potential amount which could be paid is equal to the
outstanding amounts due under the accounts receivable financing (see
Note 9). The company, the relevant subsidiaries and Ball Capital Corp. II
are not in default under the above credit arrangement.

From time
to time, the company is subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of
business. In the opinion of management, no such matter, individually or in the
aggregate, exists which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the
company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
flows.

Controls
      and Procedures

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have
established disclosure controls and procedures to seek to ensure that material
information relating to the company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
made known to the officers who certify the company’s financial reports and to
other members of senior management and the board of directors. Based on their
evaluation as of December 31, 2008, the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of the company have concluded that the company’s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective.

Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in “Internal Control – Integrated
Framework”

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based
on our evaluation under the framework in “Internal Control – Integrated
Framework,” our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which
is included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data.”

Changes
in Internal Control

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the
quarter ended December 31, 2008, that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
