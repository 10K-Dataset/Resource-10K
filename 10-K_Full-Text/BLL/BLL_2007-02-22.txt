Item
      1.

Business

Ball
      Corporation was organized in 1880 and incorporated in Indiana in 1922. Its
      principal executive offices are located at 10 Longs Peak Drive, Broomfield,
      Colorado 80021-2510. The terms "Ball," "the company," "we" and "our" as
      used herein refer to Ball Corporation and its consolidated
      subsidiaries.

Ball
      is a
      manufacturer of metal and plastic packaging, primarily for beverages, foods
      and
      household products, and a supplier of aerospace and other technologies and
      services to government and commercial customers.

Information
      Pertaining to the Business of the Company

The
      company has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product
      lines and geographic areas: (1) metal beverage packaging, Americas,
      (2) metal beverage packaging, Europe/Asia, (3) metal food and
      household products packaging, Americas, (4) plastic packaging, Americas,
      and (5) aerospace and technologies. Prior periods required to be shown in
      this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Annual Report) have been conformed to the
      current presentation.

A
      substantial part of our North American and international packaging sales are
      made directly to companies in packaged beverage and food businesses, including
      SABMiller and bottlers of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola branded beverages and their
      affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups. Sales to SABMiller
      plc,
      PepsiCo, Inc., and Coca-Cola Enterprises represented 11 percent,
      9 percent and 9 percent of Ball’s consolidated net sales,
      respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Additional details
      about sales to major customers are included in Note 2 to the consolidated
      financial statements, which can be found in Item 8 of this Annual Report
      (“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”).

North
      American Packaging Segments

Our
      principal businesses in North America are the manufacture and sale of aluminum,
      steel, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene containers, primarily
      for beverages, foods and household products. Our packaging products are sold
      in
      highly competitive markets, primarily based on quality, service and price.
      The
      North American packaging business is capital intensive, requiring significant
      investment in machinery and equipment. Profitability is sensitive to selling
      prices, production volumes, labor, transportation, utility and warehousing
      costs, as well as the availability and price of raw materials, such as aluminum,
      steel, plastic resin and other direct materials. These raw materials are
      generally available from several sources, and we have secured what we consider
      to be adequate supplies and are not experiencing any shortages. We believe
      we
      have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum, steel
      and
      plastic resin as a result of (1) the inclusion of provisions in most
      aluminum container sales contracts to pass through aluminum cost changes, as
      well as the use of derivative instruments, (2) the inclusion of provisions
      in certain steel container sales contracts to pass through steel cost changes
      and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that
      incorporate annually negotiated metal costs and (3) the inclusion of provisions
      in substantially all plastic container sales contracts to pass through resin
      cost changes. In 2006 we were able to pass through the majority of steel cost
      increases levied by producers, and we continually attempt to reduce
      manufacturing and other material costs as much as possible. While raw materials
      and energy sources, such as natural gas and electricity, may from time to time
      be in short supply or unavailable due to external factors, and the pass through
      of steel costs to our customers may be limited in some instances, we cannot
      predict the timing or effects, if any, of such occurrences on future
      operations.

Research
      and development (R&D) efforts in the North American packaging segments are
      primarily directed toward packaging innovation, specifically the development
      of
      new sizes and types of metal and plastic beverage, food and household product
      containers, as well as new uses for the current containers. Other research
      and
      development efforts in these segments seek to improve manufacturing
      efficiencies. Our North American packaging R&D activities are conducted in
      the Ball Technology and Innovation Center (BTIC) located in Westminster,
      Colorado, including the relocated R&D activities relating to the plastic
      bottle assets acquired March 28, 2006, from Alcan Packaging.

Metal
      Beverage Packaging, Americas

Metal
      beverage packaging, Americas, represents Ball’s largest segment, accounting for
      39 percent of consolidated net sales in 2006. Decorated two-piece aluminum
      beverage cans are produced at 16 manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and
      one each in Canada and Puerto Rico. Can ends are produced within three of the
      U.S. facilities, as well as in a fourth facility that manufactures only ends.
      Metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multi-year supply contracts
      to fillers of carbonated soft drinks, beer, energy drinks and other beverages.
      Sales volumes of metal beverage containers in North America tend to be highest
      during the period from April through September.

Through
      Rocky Mountain Metal Container, LLC, a 50/50 joint venture, which is accounted
      for as an equity investment, Ball and Coors Brewing Company (Coors), a wholly
      owned subsidiary of Molson Coors Brewing Company, operate beverage can and
      end
      manufacturing facilities in Golden, Colorado. The joint venture supplies Coors
      with beverage cans and ends for its Golden, Colorado, brewery and supplies
      ends
      to its Shenandoah, Virginia, filling location. Ball receives management fees
      and
      technology licensing fees under agreements with the joint venture. In addition
      to beverage containers supplied to Coors from the joint venture, Ball supplies,
      from its own facilities, substantially all of Coors’ metal container
      requirements for its Shenandoah, Virginia, filling location, as well as other
      sizes of containers not manufactured by the joint venture.

We
      also
      participate in a 50/50 joint venture in Brazil that manufactures aluminum cans
      and ends and is accounted for as an equity investment.

Based
      on
      publicly available industry information, we estimate that our North American
      metal beverage container shipments in 2006 of approximately 33 billion cans
      were approximately 32 percent of total U.S. and Canadian shipments of metal
      beverage containers. Three producers manufacture substantially all of the
      remaining metal beverage containers. Two of these producers and three other
      independent producers also manufacture metal beverage containers in Mexico.
      Available information indicates that North American metal beverage container
      shipments have been relatively flat during the past several years. Although
      in
      2006 the U.S. industry experienced a 2.3 percent growth in can shipments,
      it is difficult to predict whether this higher growth rate will become a
      trend.

Beverage
      container production capacity in the U.S., Canada and Mexico exceeds demand.
      In
      order to more closely balance capacity and demand within our business, from
      time
      to time we consolidate our can and end manufacturing capacity into fewer, more
      efficient facilities. We also attempt to efficiently match capacity with the
      changes in customer demand for our packaging products. To that end, during
      Ball commenced a project to upgrade and streamline its North American beverage
      can end manufacturing capabilities, a project expected to result in productivity
      improvements and reduced manufacturing costs. In connection with these
      activities, the company recorded a pretax charge of $19.3 million
      ($11.7 million after tax) in the third quarter of 2005. We have installed
      the first three production modules in this multi-year project and the fourth
      and
      fifth modules are in the installation phase, and the project is expected to
      be
      fully completed in 2008. In connection with this project, the can end
      manufacturing operations at the Reidsville, North Carolina, plant were shut
      down
      during the fourth quarter of 2006.

The
      aluminum beverage container continues to compete aggressively with other
      packaging materials in the beer and carbonated soft drink industries. The glass
      bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry, while carbonated
      soft
      drink and beer industry use of PET containers has grown. In Canada, metal
      beverage containers have captured significantly lower percentages of the
      packaged beverage industry than in the U.S., particularly in the packaged beer
      industry.

Metal
      Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas

Metal
      food and household products packaging, Americas, accounted for 18 percent
      of consolidated net sales in 2006. The two major product lines in this segment
      are steel food and aerosol containers. Aerosol containers were added with the
      acquisition of U.S. Can Corporation (U.S. Can) on March 27, 2006 (discussed
      below). Ball produces two-piece and three-piece steel food containers and ends
      for packaging vegetables, fruit, soups, meat, seafood, nutritional products,
      pet
      food and other products. These containers and ends are manufactured in
      9 plants in the U.S. and Canada and sold primarily to food processors in
      North America. Sales volumes of metal food containers in North America tend
      to
      be highest from June through October as a result of seasonal vegetable and
      salmon packs. We estimate our 2006 shipments of more than 6 billion steel
      food containers to be approximately 20 percent of total U.S. and Canadian
      metal food container shipments.

On
      March
      27, 2006, Ball Corporation acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of
      U.S. Can for consideration of 444,756 Ball common shares, together with the
      repayment of $598 million of existing U.S. Can debt, including $27 million
      of bond redemption premiums and fees. The acquired business manufactures and
      sells aerosol cans, paint cans, plastic containers and custom and specialty
      containers in 10 plants in the U.S. and is the largest manufacturer of aerosol
      cans in North America. In addition, the company manufactures and sells aerosol
      cans in two plants in Argentina. The acquired operations employ 2,300 people
      and
      have annual sales of approximately $600 million. The acquisition has been
      accounted for as a purchase, and, accordingly, its results have been included
      in
      our consolidated financial statements in the metal food and household products
      packaging, Americas, segment from March 27, 2006. We estimate the U.S. Can
      aerosol business accounts for approximately 53 percent of total annual U.S.
      and Canadian steel aerosol shipments.

In
      December 2006, as part of a product realignment plan, the company closed a
      leased facility in Alliance, Ohio, which was one of the 10 manufacturing
      locations acquired from U.S. Can, and a metal food can manufacturing plant
      in
      Burlington, Ontario, which was part of the metal food can operations prior
      to
      the U.S. Can acquisition. The closure of the Alliance plant was treated as
      an
      opening balance sheet item related to the acquisition. A pretax charge of
      $33.6 million ($27.4 million after tax) was recorded in the fourth
      quarter in respect of the Burlington plant closure. As part of the realignment
      plan, responsibility for the U.S. Can plastic container business was transferred
      to the company’s plastic packaging, Americas, segment effective January 1,
      2007.

Also
      in
      2006, a pretax charge of $1.4 million ($0.9 million after tax) was
      recorded to shut down a metal food can production line in the Whitby, Ontario,
      plant. Production from the line has ceased and other shut down activities are
      expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2007.

In
      the company recorded a pretax charge of $11.2 million ($7.5 million
      after tax) related to a work force reduction in the Burlington plant and to
      close a food can plant in Quebec. The Quebec plant was closed and ceased
      operations in the third quarter of 2005 and the land and building were
      sold.

Competitors
      in the metal food container product line include two national and a small number
      of regional suppliers and self manufacturers. Several producers in Mexico also
      manufacture steel food containers. Competition in the U.S. steel aerosol can
      market primarily includes two national suppliers. Steel containers also compete
      with other packaging materials in the food and household products industry
      including glass, aluminum, plastic, paper and the stand-up pouch. As a result,
      demand for this product line is dependent on product innovation and cost
      reduction. Service, quality and price are among the key competitive factors.

Plastic
      Packaging, Americas

Plastic
      packaging, Americas, accounted for 10 percent of Ball’s consolidated net
      sales in 2006. Demand for containers made of PET and polypropylene has increased
      in the beverage and food markets, with improved barrier technologies and other
      advances. This growth in demand is expected to continue. While PET and
      polypropylene beverage containers compete against metal, glass and cardboard,
      the historical increase in the sales of PET containers has come primarily at
      the
      expense of glass containers and through new market introductions. We estimate
      our 2006 shipments of more than 5.7 billion plastic containers to be
      approximately 9 percent of total U.S. and Canadian PET container shipments.
      In addition, this segment produced more than 640 million food and specialty
      containers during 2006 as a result of the Alcan Packaging (Alcan) acquisition
      (discussed below). The company operates seven plastic container manufacturing
      facilities in the U.S. and one in Canada.

On
      March
      28, 2006, Ball Corporation acquired certain North American plastic container
      net
      assets from Alcan Packaging for a total cash consideration of $185 million.
      Ball
      acquired plastic container manufacturing plants in Batavia, Illinois; Bellevue,
      Ohio; and Brampton, Ontario; as well as certain equipment and other assets
      at an
      Alcan research facility in Neenah, Wisconsin, and at a plant in Newark,
      California. Subsequent to the acquisition, the R&D activities were relocated
      from Neenah to the BTIC in Westminster, Colorado, and plastic bottle production
      at the Newark, California, plant was terminated. The costs of these activities
      were treated as opening balance sheet items. The acquired business primarily
      manufactures and sells barrier polypropylene plastic bottles used in food
      packaging and, to a lesser extent, manufactures and sells barrier PET plastic
      bottles used for beverages and foods. The acquired business employs
      approximately 470 people and has annual sales of approximately $150 million.
      The
      acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase, and, accordingly, its results
      have been included in our consolidated financial statements in the plastic
      packaging, Americas, segment from March 28, 2006.

Competition
      in the PET plastic container industry includes several national and regional
      suppliers and self manufacturers, while Ball is one of three major competitors
      in the polypropylene container industry. Service, quality and price are
      important competitive factors. The ability to produce customized, differentiated
      plastic containers is also a key competitive factor.

Most
      of
      Ball’s PET containers are sold under long-term contracts to suppliers of bottled
      water and carbonated soft drinks, including bottlers of Pepsi-Cola branded
      beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups.
      Most
      of our polypropylene containers are also sold under long-term contracts,
      primarily to food packaging companies. Plastic beer containers are being
      produced for several of our customers, and we are manufacturing plastic
      containers for the single serve juice and wine markets. Our line of Heat-Tek(TM)
      PET plastic bottles for hot-filled beverages, such as sports drinks and juices,
      includes sizes from 8 ounces to 64 ounces.

Metal
      Beverage Packaging, Europe/Asia

The
      metal
      beverage packaging, Europe/Asia, segment, which accounted for 23 percent of
      Ball’s consolidated net sales in 2006,

consists
      of 10 beverage can plants and two beverage can end plants in Europe, as
      well as operations in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Of the
      12 European plants, four are located in Germany, three in the United
      Kingdom, two in France and one each in the Netherlands, Poland and Serbia.
      The
      European plants produced approximately 13 billion cans in 2006, with
      approximately 60 percent of those being produced from aluminum and
      40 percent from steel. Six of the can plants use aluminum and four use
      steel.

Ball
      Packaging Europe is the second largest metal beverage container producer in
      Europe, with an estimated 29 percent of European shipments, and produces
      two-piece beverage cans and can ends for producers of beer, carbonated soft
      drinks, mineral water, fruit juices, energy drinks and other beverages. Ball
      Packaging Europe is the largest metal beverage container manufacturer in
      Germany, France and the Benelux countries and the second largest metal beverage
      container manufacturer in the United Kingdom and Poland. In 2005 Ball completed
      the construction of an aluminum beverage can manufacturing plant in Belgrade,
      Serbia, to serve the growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern
      Europe.

On
      April 1, 2006, a fire in the company’s Hassloch, Germany, plant damaged the
      majority of the plant’s building and machinery and equipment. Property insurance
      proceeds will largely cover equipment replacement cost and clean-up costs,
      and
      business interruption insurance proceeds generally cover lost volumes and other
      costs. In June 2006 the company announced its intention to rebuild the
      Hassloch plant with two steel lines and to add an aluminum line in its
      Hermsdorf, Germany, plant to replace the lost volume. All three lines are
      expected to be operational during the second quarter of 2007.

As
      in
      North America, the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other
      packaging materials used by the European beer and carbonated soft drink
      industries. The glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry,
      while the PET container is increasingly utilized in the carbonated soft drink,
      juice and mineral water industries.

The
      European beverage can business is capital intensive, requiring significant
      investments in machinery and equipment. Profitability is sensitive to selling
      prices, foreign exchange rates, transportation costs, production volumes, labor
      and the costs and availability of certain raw materials, such as aluminum and
      steel. The European aluminum and steel industries are highly consolidated with
      three steel suppliers and three aluminum suppliers providing 95 percent of
      European requirements. Raw material supply contracts are generally for a period
      of one year, although Ball Packaging Europe has negotiated some longer term
      agreements. Aluminum is purchased primarily in U.S. dollars while the functional
      currencies of Ball Packaging Europe and its subsidiaries are non-U.S. dollars.
      This inherently results in a foreign exchange rate risk, which the company
      minimizes through the use of derivative contracts. In addition, purchase and
      sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass-through pricing
      arrangements.

R&D
      efforts in Europe are directed toward the development of new sizes and types
      of
      metal containers, as well as new uses for the current containers. Other research
      and development objectives in this segment include improving manufacturing
      efficiencies. The European R&D activities are conducted in a technical
      center located in Bonn, Germany.

Through
      Ball Asia Pacific Limited, we are one of the largest beverage can manufacturers
      in the PRC and believe that our facilities are among the most modern in that
      country. Capacity grew rapidly in the PRC in the late 1990s, resulting in a
      supply/demand imbalance to which we responded by rationalizing capacity. Demand
      growth has resumed and projected annual growth is expected to be in the 5 to
      10 percent range in the near term. Ball is undertaking selected capacity
      increases in its existing facilities in order to participate in the projected
      growth. Our operations include the manufacture of aluminum cans and ends in
      three plants in the PRC located in the north, central and south regions. We
      also
      manufacture and sell high-density plastic containers in two PRC plants. In
      addition, we participate in two joint ventures that manufacture aluminum cans
      and ends in the PRC.

In
      the
      fourth quarter of 2006, we acquired the minority interest ownership in the
      high-density plastic (HDP) container business for $4.6 million in cash and
      signed a long-term supply contract with the former minority owner. This business
      operates two HDP container plants in the PRC.

      more
      information on Ball’s international operations, see Item 2, “Properties,” and
      Exhibit 21, “Subsidiary List.”

Aerospace
      and Technologies

The
      aerospace and technologies segment, which accounted for 10 percent of
      consolidated net sales in 2006, includes national defense solutions, advanced
      technologies and products, civil space systems and operational space businesses.
      The segment develops spacecraft, sensors and instruments, radio frequency
      systems and other advanced technologies for the civil, commercial and national
      security aerospace markets.

The
      majority of the aerospace and technologies business involves work under
      contracts, generally from one to five years in duration, as a prime contractor
      or subcontractor for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),
      the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other U.S. government agencies.
      Contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented
      90 percent of segment sales in 2006. Geopolitical events and executive and
      legislative branch priorities have yielded considerable growth opportunities
      in
      areas matching our core capabilities. However, there is strong competition
      for
      new business.

The
      civil
      space systems, defense solutions and operational space businesses include
      hardware, software and services sold primarily to U.S. customers, with emphasis
      on space science and exploration, environmental and Earth sciences, and defense
      and intelligence applications. Major contractual activities frequently involve
      the design, manufacture and testing of satellites, remote sensors and ground
      station control hardware and software, as well as related services such as
      launch vehicle integration and satellite operations.

Other
      hardware activities include: target identification, warning and attitude control
      systems and components; cryogenic systems for reactant storage, and sensor
      cooling devices using either closed-cycle mechanical refrigerators or open-cycle
      solid and liquid cryogens; star trackers, which are general-purpose stellar
      attitude sensors; and fast-steering mirrors. Additionally, the aerospace and
      technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to
      government agencies, prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad
      range of information warfare, electronic warfare, avionics, intelligence,
      training and space systems needs.

Backlog
      in the aerospace and technologies segment was $886 million and $761 million
      at
      December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and consists of the aggregate contract
      value of firm orders, excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue. The
      2006 backlog includes $528 million expected to be recognized in revenues
      during 2007, with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues
      thereafter. Unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government
      orders which are subject to annual funding were $492 million and
      $500 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Year-to-year
      comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future
      operations.

The
      company’s aerospace and technologies segment has contracts with the U.S.
      government or its contractors which have standard termination provisions. The
      government retains the right to terminate contracts at its convenience. However,
      if contracts are terminated in this manner, Ball is entitled to reimbursement
      for allowable costs and profits on authorized work performed through the date
      of
      termination. U.S. government contracts are also subject to reduction or
      modification in the event of changes in government requirements or budgetary
      constraints.

Patents

In
      the
      opinion of the company, none of its active patents is essential to the
      successful operation of its business as a whole.

Research
      and Development

Note 19,
      "Research and Development," in the consolidated financial statements within
      Item
      8 of this report, contains information on company research and development
      activity. Additional information is also included in Item 2,
“Properties.”

Environment

Aluminum,
      steel and plastic containers are recyclable, and significant amounts of used
      containers are being diverted from the solid waste stream and recycled. Using
      the most recent data available, in 2005 approximately 52 percent of
      aluminum containers, 63 percent of steel containers and 23 percent of
      the PET containers sold in the U.S. were recycled.

Recycling
      rates vary throughout Europe, but generally average 60 percent for aluminum
      and steel containers, which exceeds the European Union’s goal of 50 percent
      recycling for metals. Due in part to the intrinsic value of aluminum and steel,
      metal packaging recycling rates in the U.S. and Europe compare favorably to
      those of other packaging materials.

Compliance
      with federal, state and local laws relating to protection of the environment
      has
      not had a material, adverse effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings
      or
      competitive position of the company. As more fully described under Item 3,
      “Legal Proceedings,” the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and various state
      environmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible
      party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous
      waste sites. However, the company’s information at this time indicates that
      these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity,
      results of operations or financial condition of the company.

Legislation
      which would prohibit, tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of
      containers, and would require diversion of solid wastes such as packaging
      materials from disposal in landfills, has been or may be introduced anywhere
      we
      operate. While container legislation has been adopted in some jurisdictions,
      similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies
      in numerous others. The company anticipates that continuing efforts will be
      made
      to consider and adopt such legislation in many jurisdictions in the future.
      If
      such legislation were widely adopted, it potentially could have a material
      adverse effect on the business of the company, including its liquidity, results
      of operations or financial condition. This legislation could also have a
      material adverse effect on the container manufacturing industry generally,
      in view of the company’s substantial global sales and investment in metal and
      PET container manufacturing. However, the packages we produce are widely used
      and perform well in most jurisdictions that have deposit
      systems.

Employees

At
      the
      end of December 2006, the company employed approximately 15,500 people
      worldwide, including 11,200 employees in the U.S. and 4,300 in other
      countries. There are an additional 1,000 people employed in unconsolidated
      joint ventures in which Ball participates. Approximately one-third of Ball's
      North American packaging plant employees are unionized and most of our European
      plant employees are union workers. Collective bargaining agreements with various
      unions in the U.S. have terms of three to five years and those in Europe have
      terms of one to two years. The agreements expire at regular intervals and are
      customarily renewed in the ordinary course after bargaining between union and
      company representatives. The company believes that its employee relations are
      good and that its training, education and retention practices assist in
      enhancing employee satisfaction levels.

Item
      1A. Risk Factors

Any
      of
      the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business,
      financial condition or results of operations.

There
      can be no assurance that the U.S. Can and Alcan businesses, or any acquisition,
      will be successfully integrated into the acquiring company (see Note 3 to
      the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report for
      details of the acquisitions).

While
      we
      have what we believe to be well designed integration plans, if we cannot
      successfully integrate U.S. Can’s and Alcan’s operations with those of Ball, we
      may experience material negative consequences to our business, financial
      condition or results of operations. The integration of companies that have
      previously been operated separately involves a number of risks, including,
      but
      not limited to:

·

demands
                on management related to the increase in our size after the
                acquisition;

·

the
                diversion of management’s attention from the management of existing
                operations to the integration of the acquired
                operations;

·

difficulties
                in the assimilation and retention of
                employees;

·

difficulties
                in the integration of departments, systems, including accounting
                systems,
                technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining
                uniform standards, controls (including internal accounting controls),
                procedures and policies;

·

expenses
                related to any undisclosed or potential liabilities;
                and

·

retention
                of major customers and suppliers.

Prior
      to
      the acquisitions, Ball, U.S. Can and Alcan operated as separate businesses.
      We
      may not be able to achieve potential synergies or maintain the levels of
      revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each business had achieved or
      might achieve separately. The successful integration of U.S. Can’s and Alcan’s
      operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations, realize
      opportunities for revenue growth presented by strengthened product offerings
      and, to some degree, to eliminate redundant and excess costs.

The
      loss of a key customer could have a significant negative impact on our
      sales.

While
      we
      have diversified our customer base, we do sell a majority of our packaging
      products to relatively few major beverage, packaged food and household product
      companies, which operate in North America, South America, Europe and Asia.

Although
      approximately 70 percent of our customer contracts are long-term, these
      contracts are terminable under certain circumstances, such as our failure to
      meet quality or volume requirements. Because we depend on relatively few major
      customers, our business, financial condition or results of operations could
      be
      adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers, a reduction in the
      purchasing levels of these customers, a strike or work stoppage by a significant
      number of these customers' employees or an adverse change in the terms of the
      supply agreements with these customers.

The
      primary customers for our aerospace segment are U.S. government agencies or
      their prime contractors. These sales represented approximately 9 percent of
      Ball's consolidated 2006 net sales. Our contracts with these customers are
      subject to, among other things, the following risks:

·

unilateral
                termination for convenience by the
                customers;

·

reduction
                or modification in the scope of the contracts due to changes in the
                customer's requirements, governmental actions that preclude us from
                submitting bids or budgetary
                constraints;

·

under
                fixed-price contracts, increased or unexpected costs causing reduced
                profits or losses;

·

under
                cost reimbursement contracts, unallowable costs causing reduced profits
                or
                losses;

·

rigorous
                technical compliance standards which must be met to obtain and retain
                customers;

·

intense
                competitive activity, including from companies that are much larger
                than
                our aerospace segment; and

·

federal
                budget reductions and priorities, or changes in agency budgets, which
                could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong
                contract performance.

We
      face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our
      profitability.

Competition
      within the packaging industry is intense. Increases in productivity, combined
      with surplus capacity in the industry, have maintained competitive pricing
      pressures. The principal methods of competition in the general packaging
      industry are price, service and quality. Some of our competitors may have
      greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Our current or potential
      competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed
      superior to ours.

We
      are subject to competition from alternative products, which could result in
      lower profits and reduced cash flows.

Our
      packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute
      products, particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from PET,
      single serve beer bottles and containers made of glass, cardboard or other
      materials. Competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is
      particularly intense in the United States and the United Kingdom. There can
      be
      no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative
      products, which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow.

We
      have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our
      products decreased.

For
      the
      12 months ended December 31, 2006, 62 percent of our consolidated net
      sales were from the sale of metal beverage cans, and we expect to derive a
      significant portion of our future revenues from the sale of metal beverage
      cans.
      We sell no PET bottles in Europe. Our business would suffer if the use of metal
      beverage cans decreased. Accordingly, broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum
      and steel cans for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future
      success. If demand for glass and PET bottles increases relative to cans, or
      the
      demand for aluminum and steel cans does not develop as expected, our business,
      financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely
      affected.

Our
      business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks
      resulting from increased international operations.

We
      derived 23 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of North and
      South America in the year ended December 31, 2006. This sizeable scope of
      international operations may lead to more volatile financial results and make
      it
      more difficult for us to manage our business. Reasons for this include, but
      are
      not limited to, the following:

·

political
                and economic instability in foreign
                markets;

·

foreign
                governments' restrictive trade
                policies;

·

the
                imposition of duties, taxes or government
                royalties;

·

foreign
                exchange rate risks;

·

difficulties
                in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property
                rights; and

·

the
                geographic, language and cultural differences between personnel in
                different areas of the world.

Any
      of
      these factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial
      condition or results of operations.

We
      are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.

For
      the
      12 months ended December 31, 2006, 77 percent of our consolidated net
      sales were attributable to operations with the U.S. dollar as their functional
      currency, 11 percent with the euro as the functional currency and
      12 percent were attributable to operations having functional currencies
      other than the U.S. dollar or the euro.

Our
      reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Historically, Ball's foreign operations,
      including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses, have been
      denominated in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we expect
      that
      our foreign operations will continue to be so denominated. As a result, the
      U.S.
      dollar value of Ball's foreign operations has varied, and will continue to
      vary,
      with exchange rate fluctuations. Ball has been, and is presently, primarily
      exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro, British pound,
      Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real, Argentine
      peso
      and Serbian dinar.

A
      decrease in the value of any of these currencies, especially the euro and the
      British pound, relative to the U.S. dollar could reduce our profits from foreign
      operations and the value of the net assets of our foreign operations when
      reported in U.S. dollars in our financial statements. This could have a material
      adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations
      as
      reported in U.S. dollars.

In
      addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the
      earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period
      comparisons of our reported results of operations. For purposes of accounting,
      the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, where the local currency
      is the functional currency, are translated using period-end exchange rates,
      and
      the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated using average
      exchange rates during each period. Translation gains and losses are reported
      in
      accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of shareholders'
      equity.

We
      actively manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, particularly
      our
      exposure to fluctuations in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate, in order
      to
      mitigate the effect of foreign cash flow and reduce earnings volatility
      associated with foreign exchange rate changes. We primarily use forward
      contracts and options to manage our foreign currency exposures and, as a result,
      we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part,
      by
      the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities. Our
      inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could
      materially impact our results.

Our
      business, operating results and financial condition are subject to particular
      risks in certain regions of the world.

We
      may
      experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or
      more
      periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
      results or financial condition. Moreover, overcapacity, which often leads to
      lower prices, exists in a number of regions, including North America, South
      America and Asia, and may persist even if demand grows. Our ability to manage
      such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate long-term strategies
      in
      the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and
      profitability.

If
      we fail to retain key management and personnel, we may be unable to implement
      our key objectives.

We
      believe that our future success depends in part on our experienced management
      team. Losing the services of key members of our management team could make
      it
      difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives.

Decreases
      in our ability to apply new technology and know-how may affect our
      competitiveness.

Our
      success depends in part on our ability to improve production processes and
      services. We must also introduce new products and services to meet changing
      customer needs. If we are unable to implement better production processes or
      to
      develop new products, we may not be able to remain competitive with other
      manufacturers. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of
      operations could be adversely affected.

Bad
      weather and climate changes may result in lower
      sales.

We
      manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods. Unseasonably
      cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers.
      In addition, poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop
      yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food
      containers, creating potentially adverse effects on our business. Natural or
      other catastrophes, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires and floods, could
      significantly damage or destroy one or more of our facilities, as well as those
      of our suppliers and customers, which could adversely affect our business,
      financial condition or results of operations.

We
      are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw
      materials.

We
      purchase aluminum, steel, plastic resin and other raw materials and packaging
      supplies from several sources. While all such materials are available from
      independent suppliers, raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price
      attributable to a number of factors, including general economic conditions,
      commodity price fluctuations (particularly aluminum on the London Metal
      Exchange), the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the
      availability of complementary and substitute materials. Although we enter into
      commodities purchase agreements from time to time and use derivative instruments
      to hedge our risk, we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials
      will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities or at reasonable prices.
      Increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our
      business, financial condition or results of operations. Because our North
      American contracts often pass raw material costs directly on to the customer,
      increasing raw materials costs may not impact our near-term profitability but
      could decrease our sales volume over time. In Europe, our contracts do not
      typically allow us to pass on increased raw material costs and we regularly
      use
      derivative agreements to manage this risk. Our hedging procedures may be
      insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if materials costs
      increase.

Prolonged
      work stoppages at plants with union employees could jeopardize our financial
      position.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, approximately a third of our employees in North America
      and
      most of our employees in Europe were covered by one or more collective
      bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements have staggered
      expirations during the next three years. Although we consider our employee
      relations to be generally good, a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any
      facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our
      business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we cannot
      assure you that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements
      new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new
      agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us.

Our
      business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance
      costs.

Our
      operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating
      to environmental hazards, such as emissions to air, discharges to water, the
      handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous
      substances. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated us, along
      with numerous other companies, as a potentially responsible party for the
      cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Based on available information, we
      do
      not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have
      a
      material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations,
      capital expenditures or competitive position.

If
      we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill, our net earnings
      and
      net worth could be materially adversely affected.

We
      have
      $1,773.7 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as
      of December 31, 2006. We are required to periodically determine if our goodwill
      has become impaired, in which case we would write down the impaired portion
      of
      our goodwill. If we were required to write down all or a significant part of
      our
      goodwill, our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely
      affected.

If
      the investments in Ball's pension plans do not perform as expected, we may
      have
      to contribute additional amounts to the plans, which would otherwise be
      available to cover operating expenses.

Ball
      maintains noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans covering substantially
      all of its U.S. employees, which we fund based on certain actuarial assumptions.
      The plans' assets consist primarily of common stocks and fixed income
      securities. If the investments in the plans do not perform at expected levels,
      we will have to contribute additional funds to ensure that the plans will be
      able to pay out benefits as scheduled. Such an increase in funding could result
      in a decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings, and the recognition
      of such an increase could result in a reduction to our shareholders'
      equity.

Our
      significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us
      from
      fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond
      indentures.

We
      have a
      significant amount of debt. On December 31, 2006, we had total debt of
      $2,451.7 million. Our ratio of earnings to fixed charges as of that date
      was 3.6 times (see Exhibit 12 attached to this Annual Report). Our
      relatively high level of debt could have important consequences, including
      the
      following:

·

use
                of a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest
                on our
                notes, the new credit facilities and our other debt, which will reduce
                the
                availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital
                expenditures, research and development expenditures and other business
                activities;

·

increase
                our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry
                conditions;

·

limit
                our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business
                and the industry in which we
                operate;

·

restrict
                us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business
                opportunities;

·

place
                us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that
                have
                less debt;

·

limit
                our ability to make capital expenditures in order to maintain our
                manufacturing plants in good working order and repair;
                and

·

limit,
                along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt,
                among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose
                of
                assets or pay cash dividends.

In
      addition, a substantial portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates.
      If
      market interest rates increase, variable-rate debt will create higher debt
      service requirements, which would adversely affect our cash flow. While we
      sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure, any such agreements
      may
      not offer complete protection from this risk.

We
      will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt. Our ability
      to
      generate cash depends on many factors beyond our
      control.

Our
      ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, including the notes,
      and
      to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts,
      will
      depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general
      economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors
      that
      may be beyond our control.

Based
      on
      our current level of operations, we believe our cash flow from operations,
      available cash and available borrowings under our new credit facilities will
      be
      adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for the next several years, barring
      any unforeseen circumstances which are beyond our control.

Page
            11 of

We
      cannot
      be certain that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations
      or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facilities
      or
      otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt, including the
      notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or
      a
      portion of our debt, including the notes, on or before maturity. We cannot
      be
      sure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt, including our credit
      facilities and our senior notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at
      all.

Legal
      Proceedings

North
      America

As
      previously reported, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) considers
      the company a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) with respect to the Lowry
      Landfill site located east of Denver, Colorado. On June 12, 1992, the
      company was served with a lawsuit filed by the City and County of Denver
      (Denver) and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc., seeking contributions from
      the
      company and approximately 38 other companies. The company filed its answer
      denying the allegations of the complaint. On July 8, 1992, the company was
      served with a third-party complaint filed by S.W. Shattuck Chemical Company,
      Inc., seeking contribution from the company and other companies for the costs
      associated with cleaning up the Lowry Landfill. The company denied the
      allegations of the complaints.

In
      July
      1992 the company entered into a settlement and indemnification agreement with
      Chemical Waste Management, Inc., and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc.
      (collectively Waste Management) and Denver pursuant to which Waste Management
      and Denver dismissed their lawsuit against the company, and Waste Management
      agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the company from claims and
      lawsuits brought by governmental agencies and other parties relating to actions
      seeking contributions or remedial costs from the company for the cleanup of
      the
      site. Several other companies, which are defendants in the above-referenced
      lawsuits, had already entered into the settlement and indemnification agreement
      with Waste Management and Denver. Waste Management, Inc., has agreed to
      guarantee the obligations for Chemical Waste Management, Inc., and Waste
      Management of Colorado, Inc. Waste Management and Denver may seek additional
      payments from the company if the response costs related to the site exceed
      $319 million. In 2003 Waste Management, Inc., indicated that the cost of
      the site might exceed $319 million in 2030, approximately three years
      before the projected completion of the project. The company might also be
      responsible for payments (based on 1992 dollars) for any additional wastes
      which
      may have been disposed of by the company at the site but which are identified
      after the execution of the settlement agreement. While remediating the site,
      contaminants were encountered which could add an additional cleanup cost of
      approximately $10 million. This additional cleanup cost could, in turn, add
      approximately $1 million to total site costs for the PRP
      group.

At
      this
      time, there are no Lowry Landfill actions in which the company is actively
      involved. Based on the information available to the company at this time, the
      company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect
      upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the
      company.

The
      company previously reported that, on August 1, 1997, the USEPA sent notice
      of potential liability to 19 PRPs concerning past activities at one or more
      of the four Rocky Flats parcels (including land owned by Precision Chemicals
      now
      owned by Great Western Inorganics) at the Rocky Flats Industrial Park site
      (RFIP) located in Jefferson County, Colorado. The RFIP site also includes the
      American Ecological Recycling and Research Company (AERRCO) site and a site
      owned by Thoro Products Company. Based upon sampling at the site in 1996, the
      USEPA determined that additional site work would be required to determine the
      extent of contamination and the possible cleanup of the site. In 1996 the USEPA
      requested that the PRPs perform certain site work. On December 19, 1997,
      the USEPA issued an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to conduct engineering
      estimates and cost analyses. The company has funded approximately
      $70,000 toward these costs. The PRPs have negotiated an agreement and the
      company contributed $5,000 as an initial group contribution. The company
      has agreed to pay 12 percent of the costs of cleanup at the AERRCO site and
      a percentage of the cleanup costs on the Thoro site. On January 8, 2003,
      and October 9, 2003, the company made additional payments of $97,200 each
      (total $194,400) toward the cost of cleanup. The company paid $35,355 in
      2004 toward the cleanup. An air sparge and soil vapor extraction system was
      installed at a total cost of $1.1 million and was placed in operation in
      May 2005. Based on the information available to the company at this time, the
      company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect
      upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the
      company.

As
      previously reported, in October 2001 representatives of Vauxmont Intermountain
      Communities (Vauxmont) notified six of the PRPs at the AERRCO site, including
      the company (AERRCO PRPs), that hazardous materials might have contaminated
      property owned by Vauxmont. The AERRCO site is contained within the RFIP site.
      Vauxmont also alleges that it lost $7 million on a contract with a home
      developer for the purchase of a portion of the land. Vauxmont representatives
      requested that the AERRCO PRPs study any contamination to the Vauxmont real
      estate. The AERRCO PRPs agreed to undertake such a study and sought the USEPA’s
      final approval. The sampling results were made available to all parties. No
      further claims have been made against the company by Vauxmont to date. Based
      on
      the information available to the company at the present time, the company does
      not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the
      liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the
      company.

As
      previously reported, during July 1992, the company received information that
      it
      had been named a PRP with respect to the Solvents Recovery of New England Site
      (SRSNE) located in Southington, Connecticut. According to the information
      received, it is alleged that the company contributed approximately
      0.08816 percent of the waste contributed to the site on a volumetric basis.
      The PRP group has been involved in negotiations with the USEPA regarding the
      remediation of the site. The company has paid approximately $17,500 toward
      site investigation and remediation efforts. The PRP group spent $15 million
      through the end of 2001. Approximately $1.5 million more was spent to
      complete a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study and pay for remediation
      work through 2003. As of December 2001, projected remediation cost estimates
      for
      a bioremediation and enhanced oxidation system ranged from $20 million to
      $30 million. The PRP group offered a $5.5 million settlement to
      resolve the USEPA claim of $16 million for past costs at the SRSNE site.
      PRP/USEPA negotiations to resolve the past cost claims from the USEPA have
      not
      been resolved and are not being actively pursued by the PRP group. A natural
      resources damage claim of approximately $3 million is anticipated. USEPA
      gave final approval for a $29 million remediation plan for the site on
      October 11, 2005. The cost of the site remedy is now expected to be between
      $35 million and $44 million. The company will be responsible for
      approximately 0.00109 percent of the future site costs. Based on the
      information available to the company at the present time, the company does
      not
      believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity,
      results of operations or financial condition of the company.

On
      December 30, 2002, the company received a 104(e) letter from the USEPA
      pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability
      Act (CERCLA) requesting answers to certain questions regarding the waste
      disposal practices of Heekin Can Company and the relationship between the
      company and Heekin Can Company. Region 5 of the USEPA is involved in the cleanup
      of the Jackson Brothers Paint Company site, which consists of four, and possibly
      five, sites in and around Laurel, Indiana. The Jackson Brothers Paint Company
      apparently disposed of drums of waste in those sites during the 1960s and 1970s.
      The USEPA has alleged that some of the waste that has been uncovered was sent
      to
      the sites from the Cincinnati plant operated by Heekin Can Company. The Indiana
      Department of Environmental Management referred this matter to the USEPA for
      removal of the drums and cleanup. At the present time there are an undetermined
      number of drums at one or more of the sites that have been initially identified
      by the USEPA as originating from Heekin Can Company. The USEPA has sent 104(e)
      letters to seven PRPs including Heekin Can Company. On January 30, 2003,
      the company responded to the request for information pursuant to
      Section 104(e) of CERCLA. The USEPA has initially estimated cleanup costs
      to be between $4 million and $5 million. Based on the information
      available to the company at the present time, the company does not believe
      that
      this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results
      of
      operations or financial condition of the company.

As
      previously reported, on October 6, 2005, Ball Metal Beverage Container
      Corp. (BMBCC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, was served with an
      amended complaint filed by Crown Packaging Technology, Inc. et. al.
      (Crown), in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western
      Division at Dayton, Ohio. The complaint alleges that the manufacture, sale
      and
      use of certain ends by BMBCC and its customers infringes certain claims of
      Crown’s U.S. patents. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, fees,
      and declaratory and injunctive relief. BMBCC has formally denied the allegations
      of the complaint. A trial is currently set for May 7, 2007. Based on the
      information available to the company at the present time, the company does
      not
      believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity,
      results of operations or financial condition of the company.

As
      previously reported, on November 21, 2005, Ball Plastic Container Corp.
      (BPCC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, was served with a complaint
      filed by Constar International Inc. (Constar) in the U.S. District Court for
      the
      Western District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that the manufacture and
      sale of plastic bottles having oxygen barrier properties infringed certain
      claims of a Constar U.S. patent. Constar also sued Honeywell International
      Inc.,
      the supplier of the oxygen barrier material to BPCC. The complaint sought
      monetary damages, fees and declaratory and injunctive relief. BPCC formally
      denied the allegations of the complaint. On July 26, 2006, this case was
      settled by the parties. This matter is now resolved without any material adverse
      effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or the financial condition
      of
      the company.

Europe

Ball
      Packaging Europe GmbH (BPE), together with certain other plaintiffs, contested
      the enactment of the mandatory deposit for non-returnable containers based
      on
      the German Packaging Regulation (Verpackungsverordnung) in Federal and State
      Administrative Court. All other proceedings have been terminated except for
      the
      determination of minimal court fees that are still outstanding in some cases,
      together with minimal ancillary legal fees.

In
      January 2003 the German government passed legislation that imposed a
      mandatory deposit of 25 eurocents on all one-way packages containing
      beverages except milk, wine, fruit juices and certain alcoholic beverages.
      The
      relevant industries, including BPE and its competitors, have successfully set
      up
      a Germany-wide return system for one-way beverage containers which has been
      operational since May 1, 2006, the date required under the deposit
      legislation. Based upon the information available to the company at the present
      time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse
      effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of
      the
      company.

Management’s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations

Management’s
      discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
      financial statements and accompanying notes. Ball Corporation and its
      subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “Ball” or “the company” or “we” or
“our” in the following discussion and analysis.

BUSINESS
      OVERVIEW

Ball
      Corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal and plastic
      packaging to the beverage, food and household products industries. Our packaging
      products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured
      in plants around the world. We also supply aerospace and other technologies
      and services to governmental and commercial customers.

We
      sell
      our packaging products primarily to major beverage and food companies and
      producers of household products with which we have developed long-term customer
      relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large
      number of long-term supply contracts. While we have diversified our customer
      base, we do sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major
      companies in North America, Europe, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and
      Argentina, as do our equity joint ventures in Brazil, the U.S. and the PRC.
      We
      also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers. Because of our
      customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial condition and
      results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of a major
      customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer
      or
      supplier, although our long-term relationships and contracts mitigate these
      risks.

In
      the
      rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs,
      developing new products, volume expansion and increasing pricing. In 2008 we
      expect to complete a project to upgrade and streamline our North American
      beverage can end manufacturing capabilities, a project that is expected to
      result in productivity gains and cost reductions beginning in 2007. While the
      U.S. and Canadian beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively
      mature, the European, PRC and Brazilian beverage can markets are growing and
      are
      expected to continue to grow. We are capitalizing on this growth by continuing
      to reconfigure some of our European can manufacturing lines and by having
      constructed a new beverage can manufacturing plant in Belgrade, Serbia, in
      2005.
      To better position the company in the European market, the capacity from the
      fire-damaged Hassloch, Germany, plant will be replaced with a mix of steel
      beverage can manufacturing capacity in the Hassloch plant and aluminum beverage
      can manufacturing capacity in the company’s Hermsdorf, Germany,
      plant.

As
      part
      of our packaging strategy, we are focused on developing and marketing new and
      existing products that meet the needs of our customers. These innovations
      include new shapes, sizes, opening features and other functional benefits of
      both metal and plastic packaging. This packaging development activity helps
      us
      maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage, food and household
      products customers.

Ball’s
      consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We
      attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial
      instruments, as discussed in “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
      Market Risk” within Item 7A of this report.

The
      primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and
      technologies segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors.
      It
      is possible that

federal
      budget reductions and priorities, or changes in agency budgets, could limit
      future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong contract
      performance

.

We
      recognize sales under long-term contracts in the aerospace and technologies
      segment using the cost-to-cost, percentage of completion method of accounting.
      Our present contract mix consists of approximately two-thirds cost-type
      contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and/or earned
      profit component, and approximately one-third fixed price contracts. We
      include time and material contracts in the fixed price category because such
      contracts typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly
      rates.

Page
            21 of

Throughout
      the period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary,
      revise our estimates of total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress
      toward completion. Because of contract payment schedules, limitations on funding
      and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this segment
      include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.

Management
      uses various measures to evaluate company performance. The primary financial
      metric we use is economic valued added (operating earnings, as defined by the
      company, less a charge for net operating assets employed). Our goal is to
      increase economic valued added on an annual basis. Other financial metrics
      we
      use are earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest,
      taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), diluted earnings per share,
      operating cash flow and free cash flow (generally defined by the company as
      cash
      flow from operating activities less capital expenditures). These financial
      measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between
      periods. Nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include production
      spoilage rates, quality control figures, safety statistics and production and
      shipment volumes. Additional measures used to evaluate performance in the
      aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization, award
      and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog (including awarded,
      contracted and funded backlog).

We
      recognize that attracting and retaining quality employees is essential to the
      success of Ball and, because of this, we strive to pay employees competitively
      and encourage their ownership of the company’s common stock as part of a
      diversified portfolio. For most management employees, a meaningful portion
      of
      compensation is at risk as an incentive, dependent upon economic value added
      operating performance. For more senior positions, more compensation is at risk.
      Through our employee stock purchase plan and 401(k) plan, which matches employee
      contributions with Ball common stock, employees, regardless of organizational
      level, have opportunities to own Ball shares.

RECENT
      DEVELOPMENTS

On
      March 27, 2006, Ball acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of
      U.S. Can Corporation (U.S. Can) for consideration of 444,756 common shares
      of Ball Corporation (valued at $44.28 per share for a total of
      $19.7 million). In connection with the acquisition, Ball refinanced
      $598.2 million of U.S. Can debt, including $26.8 million of bond
      redemption premiums and fees, and over the next several years expects to realize
      approximately $42 million for acquired net operating tax loss
      carryforwards. As a result of this acquisition, Ball became the largest
      manufacturer of aerosol cans in North America and now manufactures aerosol
      cans,
      paint cans, plastic containers and custom and specialty cans in 10 plants
      in the U.S. and aerosol cans in two plants in Argentina. In October 2006
      the company announced it would close an acquired plant in Alliance, Ohio. The
      acquired operations have annual sales of approximately $600 million. The
      acquired business forms part of Ball’s metal food and household products
      packaging, Americas, segment and its results have been included since the date
      of acquisition. Effective January 1, 2007, responsibility for the U.S. Can
      plastics business was transferred to our plastic packaging, Americas,
      segment.

On
      March 28, 2006, Ball acquired North American plastic bottle container
      assets from Alcan Packaging (Alcan) for $184.7 million cash. This
      acquisition strengthens the company’s plastic container business and complements
      its food container business. The acquired assets included two plastic container
      manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada, as well as certain
      manufacturing equipment and other assets from other Alcan facilities. The
      acquired business primarily manufactures and sells barrier polypropylene plastic
      bottles used in food packaging and, to a lesser extent, barrier PET plastic
      bottles used for beverages and food. The acquired operations have annual sales
      of approximately $150 million. The operations form part of Ball’s plastic
      packaging, Americas, segment and their results have been included since the
      date
      of acquisition.

The
      company refinanced U.S. Can’s debt at the time of the acquisition with
      significantly lower interest rates through the issuance by Ball Corporation
      of
      $450 million of new senior notes and a $500 million increase in bank
      debt under the senior credit facilities put in place in the fourth quarter
      of
      2005. The proceeds of these financings were also used to acquire the Alcan
      operations and to reduce seasonal working capital debt.

On
      April 1, 2006, a fire in the metal beverage can plant in Hassloch, Germany,
      damaged the majority of the building and machinery and equipment. In
      November 2006 the company reached final agreement with the insurance
      carrier on property insurance and business interruption recoveries. Additional
      details are available in the “Consolidated Sales and Earnings” section for the
“Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe/Asia” segment.

            22 of

In
      June 2006 the company’s U.S. defined benefit plans for salaried employees
      were amended to provide more flexibility for future pension benefits by allowing
      portability and changing the benefit to a career average pay scheme that grows
      by a prescribed amount annually. The annual accounting expense under the amended
      plans will be lower and more predictable. The

amendments,
      which were effective January 1, 2007, reduced 2006 pension expense by
      approximately $7 million. We intend to reduce our current return on asset
      assumption for the U.S. pension plans to 8.25 percent for 2007, based upon
      current market conditions and anticipated long-term rate of return on plan
      assets, while increasing the discount rate assumption to 6 percent. Based
      on these assumptions and the 2006 salaried plan design changes, U.S. pension
      expense for 2007 is anticipated to increase $4 million compared to 2006,
      most of which will be included in cost of sales. Pension expense in Europe
      and
      Canada combined is expected to be slightly higher than the 2006 expense. A
      reduction of the plan asset return assumption by one quarter of a percentage
      point would result in additional expense of approximately $2.2 million
      while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate would
      result in approximately $1.9 million of additional expense. Additional
      information regarding the company’s pension plans is provided in Note 14
      accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this
      report.

CONSOLIDATED
      SALES AND EARNINGS

The
      company has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product
      lines and geographic areas: (1) metal beverage packaging, Americas,
      (2) metal beverage packaging, Europe/Asia, (3) metal food and
      household products packaging, Americas, (4) plastic packaging, Americas,
      and (5) aerospace and technologies. We also have investments in companies
      in the U.S., the PRC and Brazil, which are accounted for using the equity method
      of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales
      or earnings. We expect a strong first quarter in 2007 as elevated raw material
      inventories are reduced to more normal levels.

During
      the fourth quarter of 2006, Ball’s management changed its method of inventory
      accounting for certain invnetories from the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method
      to
      the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method in the metal beverage, Americas, and
      the
      metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segments. All periods
      presented have been retrospectively adjusted on a FIFO basis. In the third
      quarter of 2006, the company changed its expense allocation method by allocating
      to each of the packaging segments stock-based compensation expense previously
      included in corporate undistributed expenses. The change did not have a
      significant impact on any segment for the current or prior years. Prior periods
      have been conformed to the current presentation of the segments and the change
      in expense allocation.

Metal
      Beverage Packaging, Americas

The
      metal
      beverage packaging, Americas, segment consists of operations located in the
      U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, which manufacture products used primarily in
      beverage packaging. This segment accounted for 39 percent of consolidated
      net sales in 2006 (42 percent in 2005). Sales were 9 percent higher in
      2006 than in 2005 due to more than 4 percent higher beverage can shipments
      coupled with higher aluminum prices passed through to our customers. The
      increased sales over 2005 were also driven by favorable weather in many parts
      of
      the U.S. and Canada, as well as the promotion of 12-ounce can packages by beer
      and soft drink companies. Sales in 2005 were slightly higher than in 2004 as
      lower 2005 sales volumes were offset by the pass through of higher aluminum
      prices. Metal beverage container volumes in 2005 were 2.5 percent below the
      previous year’s levels as a result of poor weather in the first quarter,
      temporary volume reductions and general softness in the beer and carbonated
      soft
      drink markets. Based on publicly available information, we estimate that our
      shipments of metal beverage containers were approximately 32 percent of
      total U.S. and Canadian shipments in 2006.

We
      continue to focus efforts on the growing custom beverage can business, which
      includes cans of different shapes, diameters and fill volumes, and cans with
      added functional attributes for new products and product line extensions. During
      the first quarter of 2006, we completed the conversion of a line in our
      Monticello, Indiana, plant from 12-ounce can manufacturing to a line capable
      of
      producing other sizes.

Earnings
      in the segment were $269.4 million in 2006 compared to $234.8 million
      in 2005 and $275.7 million in 2004. The third quarter of 2005 included a
      pretax charge of $19.3 million ($11.7 million after tax) related to a
      project to significantly upgrade and streamline our North American beverage
      can
      end manufacturing capabilities. The charge included the write off of obsolete
      equipment spare parts and tooling, as well as employee termination costs. Over
      time, this capital project is expected to result in productivity improvements
      and reduced manufacturing

Page
            23 of

costs.
      We
      have installed and are operating three of eight production modules in this
      multi-year project and the fourth and fifth modules are in the installation
      phase. The project is expected to be completed in 2008. In connection with
      this
      project, the can end manufacturing operations at the Reidsville, North Carolina,
      plant were shut down during the fourth quarter of 2006.

Despite
      higher sales in 2006, segment earnings growth was constrained by product mix
      and
      continued year-over-year cost growth, particularly higher energy, other direct
      material and freight costs, which were $21 million more than in 2005. While
      contract price escalations have commenced for many of our customers, cost growth
      has continued to outpace price increases. Energy, freight and other direct
      material costs were $32 million higher in 2005 than in 2004, partially
      offset by efficiency gains, cost controls and lower selling, general and
      administrative costs in 2005. While pricing pressures continue on our raw
      materials, other direct materials, and freight and utility costs, we continue
      to
      work with both customers and suppliers to maintain our volumes, as well as
      preserve our margins.

Metal
      Beverage Packaging, Europe/Asia

The
      metal
      beverage packaging, Europe/Asia, segment includes the production and sale of
      metal beverage container products manufactured and sold in Europe and Asia
      as
      well as plastic containers manufactured and sold in Asia. This segment accounted
      for 23 percent of consolidated net sales in 2006 (24 percent in 2005).
      Ball Packaging Europe, which represents an estimated 29 percent of the
      total European metal beverage container manufacturing capacity, has
      manufacturing plants located in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the
      Netherlands, Poland and Serbia.

Due
      to
      strong demand, segment can shipments were more than 9 percent higher in
      2006 than in 2005. Higher segment sales volumes were aided by favorable European
      weather and Germany hosting the World Cup soccer championship during June and
      July 2006, as well as by continued growth in the China market. Segment
      sales, which grew 12 percent in 2006, also benefited from the strength of
      the euro. Segment sales were approximately 9 percent higher in 2005
      than in 2004 primarily as a result of an increase in sales volumes.

The
      slow
      return of the can to the German market, as a result of the mandatory deposit
      legislation previously reported on, is being more than offset by stronger demand
      elsewhere in Europe, including southern and eastern Europe. We expect PRC demand
      for aluminum beverage cans to grow in the coming years, as both multinational
      and Chinese beverage fillers expand their markets.

The
      construction of a new beverage can plant in Belgrade, Serbia, was completed
      near
      the end of the second quarter of 2005 to serve the growing demand for beverage
      cans in southern and eastern Europe. The plant became fully operational during
      the third quarter of 2005. The Serbian plant was constructed to accommodate
      a
      second can production line and a can end manufacturing module for future
      growth.

Earnings
      in the segment were $268.7 million in 2006, $180.5 million in 2005 and
      $195.1 million in 2004. Segment earnings in 2006 included a
      $75.5 million property insurance gain related to a fire at the company’s
      Hassloch, Germany, metal beverage can plant (further details are provided in
      the
“Recent Developments” section). The third quarter of 2006 also included a gain
      of $5.5 million related to the change in an estimated liability. The fourth
      quarter of 2005 included a $9.3 million gain primarily resulting from the
      final settlement of all tax obligations related to liquidated China operations
      for amounts less than originally estimated. First quarter 2005 segment earnings
      included a $3.4 million expense for the write off of the remaining carrying
      value of an equity investment in the PRC. Earnings in 2004 included income
      of
      $13.7 million related to the realization of proceeds on assets in the PRC
      being in excess of amounts previously estimated, and costs of liquidation being
      less than anticipated in a prior year business consolidation charge.

      earnings in 2006 were higher than in 2005 due to the property insurance gain,
      higher volumes, price recovery initiatives and effective manufacturing and
      selling, general and administrative cost controls; partially offset by higher
      raw material, freight and energy costs, and price/cost compression in the PRC.
      Higher material, energy and transportation costs, as well as second and third
      quarter start up costs related to a line conversion in the Netherlands and
      the
      new Serbia plant, had a negative effect on 2005 segment earnings compared to
      2004. Partially offsetting these higher costs were lower selling, general and
      administrative costs.

On
      April 1, 2006, a fire in the metal beverage can plant in Hassloch, Germany,
      damaged the majority of the building, machinery and equipment. The property
      insurance proceeds recorded for the year ended December 31, 2006, which are
      based on replacement cost, were €86.3 million ($109.3 million), of
      which €26 million ($32.4 million) was received in April 2006,
€22.7 million ($28.9 million) was received in October 2006 and
      the remainder of €37.6 million ($49.6 million), which was recorded in
      other long-term assets, was received in January 2007. A
€26.7 million ($33.8 million) fixed asset write down was recorded
      to reflect the estimated impairment of the assets damaged as a result of the
      fire. As a result, a gain of €59.6 million ($75.5 million pretax) was
      recorded in the 2006 consolidated statement of earnings to reflect the
      difference between the net book value of the impaired assets and the property
      insurance proceeds. An additional €15 million ($19 million),
€13 million ($16.5 million) and €12 million ($15.5 million)
      were recorded in cost of sales in the second, third and fourth quarters,
      respectively, for insurance recoveries related to business interruption costs,
      as well as €11.3 million ($14.3 million) to offset clean-up costs.

An
      additional €27 million of business interruption recoveries has been agreed
      upon with the insurance carrier and will be recognized in 2007.

In
      June 2006 the company announced its intention to rebuild the Hassloch plant
      with two steel lines and to add an aluminum line in its Hermsdorf, Germany,
      plant. All three lines are expected to be operational during the second quarter
      of 2007.

In
      the
      fourth quarter of 2006, we acquired the minority interest in our two PRC
      high-density plastic joint ventures for $4.6 million in cash. During the
      fourth quarter of 2004, Sanshui Jianlibao FTB Packaging Limited (Sanshui JFP),
      a
      35 percent owned PRC joint venture, experienced a greater than customary
      seasonal production slowdown caused by cash flow difficulties. In response,
      we
      recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts in respect of Sanshui JFP’s
      receivable from the joint venture partner for $15.2 million, which was
      included in the 2004 consolidated statement of earnings as equity in results
      of
      affiliates. Information learned late in the first quarter of 2005 led the
      company to record expense of $3.4 million to write off the remaining
      carrying value of this investment.

Earnings
      of $9.3 million and $13.7 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, were
      recognized as PRC restructuring activities that commenced in 2001 were
      completed, resulting in realization on assets in excess of amounts previously
      estimated, as well as costs incurred being less than estimated, including
      settlement of tax matters. All costs and transactions related to the PRC
      restructuring have been concluded.

      details regarding business consolidation activities are available in Note 4
      accompanying the consolidated financial statements included within Item 8
      of this Annual Report.

Metal
      Food and Household Products Packaging, Americas

The
      metal
      food and household products packaging, Americas, segment consists of operations
      located in the U.S., Canada and Argentina. With the acquisition of U.S. Can
      (discussed in the “Recent Developments” section), the segment added to its metal
      food can manufacturing the production of aerosol cans, paint cans, certain
      plastic containers and custom and specialty cans. Segment sales in 2006
      comprised 18 percent of consolidated net sales (14 percent in 2005)
      and were 44 percent higher than 2005 sales. The primary reason for the
      increase was the acquisition of U.S. Can. The favorable impact on 2006 sales
      of
      the pass through of higher raw material costs was offset by lower third quarter
      food can volumes. Sales in 2005 were 6 percent higher than in 2004,
      reflecting higher prices from the pass through of higher raw material costs.
      Sales volumes were flat compared to 2004 levels including, in the first quarter
      of 2005, the inclusion of a full quarter’s results from our Oakdale, California,
      facility, which was acquired in March 2004. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we
      were able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases and
      surcharges levied by steel producers. Based on publicly available trade
      information, we estimate our 2006 shipments of more than 6 billion steel
      food containers and 1.7 billion aerosol containers to be
      approximately 20 percent and 53 percent of total U.S. and
      Canadian metal food container and steel aerosol container shipments,
      respectively.

Segment
      earnings were $6 million in 2006 compared to $19.1 million in 2005 and
      $46.4 million in 2004. The fourth quarter of 2006 included a pretax charge
      of $33.8 million, primarily for the closure of a metal food can
      manufacturing plant in Burlington, Ontario, as part of the realignment of the
      segment following the U.S. Can acquisition (discussed in more detail below).
      The
      first six months of 2006 included a net pretax charge of $1.7 million
      primarily related to the shut down of a metal food can manufacturing line in
      the
      Whitby, Ontario, plant.

Page
            25 of

The
      fourth quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge of $4.6 million
      ($3.1 million after tax) for pension, severance and other employee benefit
      costs related to a reduction in force in the Burlington plant. The second
      quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge of $8.8 million ($5.9 million
      after tax) for the closure of a three-piece food can manufacturing plant in
      Quebec. The Quebec plant was closed and ceased operations in the third quarter
      of 2005 and an agreement was reached to sell the land and building, which
      resulted in the second quarter charge being offset by a $2.2 million gain
      ($1.5 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2006 to adjust the plant
      to net realizable value.

Higher
      sales volumes related to the U.S. Can acquisition helped improve segment
      earnings in the last nine months of 2006, despite the negative impact of lower
      food can volumes attributable to the loss of a customer in late 2005 and a
      poor
      salmon harvest in 2006. Additionally, segment earnings in 2006 were reduced
      by
      purchase accounting adjustments of $6.1 million, which increased cost of
      sales due to inventory valuations associated with the acquired U.S. Can finished
      goods inventory. Contributing to lower segment earnings in 2005 compared to
      were higher freight costs from fuel surcharges and higher other direct material
      and utility costs. Energy, freight and other direct material costs were
      $16 million higher in 2005 than in 2004, partially offset by efficiency
      gains, cost controls and lower selling, general and administrative costs in
      2005. While pricing pressures continue on all of our raw materials, other direct
      materials and freight and utility costs, we continue to work with both customers
      and suppliers to maintain our volumes, as well as to preserve our
      margins.

In
      October 2006 the company announced plans to close two manufacturing
      facilities in North America by the end of 2006 as part of the realignment of
      the
      metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment following the
      acquisition of U.S. Can earlier in the year. The company closed a leased
      facility in Alliance, Ohio, which was one of 10 manufacturing locations
      acquired from U.S. Can, and a plant in Burlington, Ontario, which was part
      of
      the metal food can operations prior to the U.S. Can acquisition. A pretax charge
      of $33.8 million ($27.5 million after tax) was recorded in the fourth
      quarter, primarily related to the Burlington closure for employee termination
      and pension costs, plant decommissioning costs and fixed asset impairment.
      The
      closure of the Ohio plant has been treated as an opening balance sheet item.
      The
      estimated costs of the closures will be cash flow neutral after tax benefits
      and
      anticipated proceeds from the sale of fixed assets.

The
      company continues to evaluate the segment’s manufacturing structure and expects
      to identify other opportunities to improve efficiencies.

Additional
      details regarding business consolidation activities are available in Note 4
      accompanying the consolidated financial statements included within Item 8
      of this Annual Report.

Plastic

Packaging,
      Americas

The
      plastic packaging, Americas, segment consists of operations located in the
      U.S.
      and Canada which manufacture polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene
      plastic container products used mainly in beverage and food packaging. Segment
      sales in 2006 comprised 10 percent of consolidated sales (8 percent in
      2005) and increased 32 percent compared to 2005 due largely to the plant
      and other asset acquisitions from Alcan and higher PET bottle volumes. We
      continue to focus PET development efforts in the custom hot-fill, beer, wine,
      flavored alcoholic beverage and specialty container markets, and we are adding
      specialty container production capacity to accommodate new demand. In the food
      and specialty area, development efforts are focused on custom markets as
      well.

The
      22 percent sales increase in 2005 compared to 2004 was largely due to the
      pass through to our customers of higher resin prices, as well as
      7.5 percent higher sales volumes in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of
      higher demand for barrier and heat-set containers that provide longer shelf-life
      for products, combined with strong demand for plastic water bottles. Although
      only a small percentage of our total volume, sales of juice, sports drink and
      beer containers increased in 2006. These sales are expected to grow in the
      future as more focus is placed on such specialty markets and the development
      of
      our Heat-Tek(TM) business. We estimate our 2006 shipments of more than
      5.7 billion PET plastic containers to be approximately 9 percent of
      total U.S. and Canadian PET container shipments. In addition, the plastic
      packaging, Americas, segment produced more than 640 million food and
      specialty containers during 2006.

Page
            26 of

Segment
      earnings were $24.7 million in 2006 compared to $16.7 million in 2005
      and $9.6 million in 2004. Segment earnings in 2006 were higher than in 2005
      largely due to the incremental sales from the Alcan acquisition, but were
      partially offset by energy cost increases of approximately $6 million, the
      timing of resin cost increases and costs incurred for a litigation claim that
      was favorably resolved in July 2006. Earnings in the second quarter of 2006
      also included purchase accounting adjustments of $1.2 million, which
      increased cost of sales due to the valuation of inventories associated with
      the
      acquired Alcan finished goods inventory. In 2007 the plastic packaging,
      Americas, segment will include the sales and earnings of a plastic pail business
      which was recorded in the 2006 operating results of the metal food and household
      products packaging, Americas, segment.

The
      improvement in earnings in 2005 over 2004 was the result of higher sales and
      production volumes and growth in specialty products. Partially offsetting these
      improvements in 2005 were higher utility costs. Segment earnings in 2004 were
      reduced by $1.3 million, primarily related to costs associated with the
      relocation of the plastics offices and research and development facility from
      Atlanta, Georgia, to Colorado. Earnings in 2004 were also negatively impacted
      by
      continued pricing pressures on plastic containers for carbonated soft drink
      and
      water customers.

Aerospace
      and Technologies

Aerospace
      and technologies segment sales represented 10 percent of 2006 consolidated
      net sales (12 percent in 2005) and were 3 percent lower than in 2005.
      Sales in 2005 were 6 percent higher than in 2004. The lower 2006 sales were
      largely due to contracts being completed during the period, as well as the
      impact of government funding reductions and program delays. Higher sales in
      compared to 2004 resulted from a combination of newly awarded contracts and
      additions to previously awarded contracts. The aerospace and technologies
      business won a number of large, strategic contracts and delivered a considerable
      amount of sophisticated space and defense instrumentation throughout the
      three-year period.

Segment
      earnings were $50 million in 2006, $54.7 million in 2005 and
      $48.7 million in 2004. The first quarter of 2005 included expense of
      $3.8 million for the write down to net realizable value of an equity
      investment in an aerospace company. This investment was sold in
      October 2005 for approximately its carrying value. Earnings in 2006 were
      negatively affected by the lower sales due to program delays and unfavorable
      contract mix. The improvement in 2005 earnings compared to 2004 was primarily
      the result of higher sales and improved program performance.

Some
      of
      the segment’s high-profile contracts include: WorldView 1 and
      WorldView 2, advanced commercial remote sensing satellites; the James Webb
      Space Telescope, a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope; the Space-Based
      Space Surveillance System, which will detect and track space objects such as
      satellites and orbital debris; NPOESS, the next-generation satellite weather
      monitoring system; and a number of antennas for the Joint Strike
      Fighter.

Sales
      to
      the U.S. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as
      a
      subcontractor, represented 90 percent of segment sales in 2006,
      87 percent in 2005 and 82 percent in 2004

.

Contracted
      backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at December 31, 2006 and
      2005, was $886 million and $761 million, respectively. Year-to-year
      comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future
      operations.

Additional
        Segment Information

For
      additional information regarding the company’s segments, see the summary of
      business segment information in Note 2 accompanying the consolidated financial
      statements within Item 8 of this report. The charges recorded for business
      consolidation activities were based on estimates by Ball management, actuaries
      and other independent parties and were developed from information available
      at
      the time. If actual outcomes vary from the estimates, the differences will
      be
      reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings
      and identified as business consolidation gains and losses. Additional details
      about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided
      in
      Note 4 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within
      Item 8 of this report.

Selling,
      General and Administrative Expenses

Selling,
      general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $287.2 million,
      $233.8 million and $268.8 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 was
      primarily the result of $20 million of incremental SG&A (after realized
      synergies) from the acquired U.S. Can operations, a $5.8 million
      out-of-period adjustment (discussed below), higher expense of $6.3 million
      associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),
      $2 million for higher rates associated with the company’s receivables sales
      agreement, $5 million of increased legal fees related to patent litigation,
      $6.7 million for an initial mark-to-market adjustment to one of the
      company’s deferred compensation stock plans due to a plan amendment and normal
      compensation and benefit increases. Expenses in 2005 were lower than 2004 in
      all
      areas of the company due largely to lower employee compensation and benefit
      costs, including the company’s deposit share program and economic-value-added
      based incentive compensation plans. These lower costs were partially offset
      by
      higher pension costs, higher accounts receivable securitization fees and the
      write down of the PRC and aerospace equity investments in the first quarter
      of
      2005.

Subsequent
      to the issuance of its financial statements for the year ended December 31,
      2005, the company determined that certain foreign currency exchange losses
      had
      been inadvertently deferred for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003. Since the amounts
      were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to any previously issued
      financial statements or to our full year results of operations for 2006, a
      cumulative $5.8 million out-of-period adjustment was included in SG&A
      expenses in the first quarter of 2006.

On
      October 26, 2005, Ball’s board of directors approved the accelerated
      vesting of the out-of-the-money, unvested nonqualified stock options granted
      in
      April 2005. The acceleration affected approximately 665,000 options
      granted to approximately 290 employees at an exercise price of $39.74. The
      accelerated vesting of these nonqualified options allowed the company to
      eliminate approximately $5 million of pretax expense (approximately
      $3 million after tax) combined for 2006 to 2009.

Interest
      and Taxes

Consolidated
      interest expense was $134.4 million in 2006; $116.4 million, including
      debt refinancing costs of $19.3 million, in 2005 and $103.7 million in
      2004. The higher expense in 2006 was primarily due to the additional borrowings
      used to finance the acquisitions of U.S. Can and the Alcan assets. The lower
      expense in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to lower average borrowings and higher
      capitalized interest. The debt refinancing costs in 2005 of $19.3 million
      were costs associated with the refinancing of the company’s senior credit
      facilities and the redemption in the last half of 2005 of the company’s
      7.75% senior notes, which were due in August 2006.

Ball’s
      consolidated effective income tax rate for 2006 was 29.4 percent compared
      to 29.2 percent in 2005 and 32.2 percent in 2004. While the
      effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 are similar, the 2006 rate was impacted
      by
      a one-time tax benefit of $8.1 million associated with a foreign exchange loss
      as a result of the change in the functional currency of a European subsidiary
      in
      the local statutory accounts. The one-time benefit was somewhat offset by a
      higher foreign tax rate differential due to taxation of the German property
      insurance gain at the marginal rate of 39% and a valuation allowance on a
      Canadian net operating loss resulting from the 2006 business consolidation
      costs. The 2005 rate was impacted by the tax benefit recorded on the
      repatriation of foreign earnings (see further discussion below) plus the tax
      benefit on business consolidation costs applied at the higher marginal rate.

The
      decrease in the 2005 effective tax rate compared to 2004 is primarily due to
      the
      net tax benefit recorded on the repatriation of foreign earnings under the
      American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act), the tax benefit on business
      consolidation costs applied at the marginal tax rate, increased research and
      development tax credits and the manufacturing deduction effective in 2005 under
      the Jobs Act. (Further details of the amounts repatriated under the Jobs Act
      are
      available in Note 13 accompanying the consolidated financial statements
      within Item 8 of this report.) These benefits were somewhat offset by the
      fact that no tax benefit was provided in respect of the equity investment write
      downs in the first quarter of 2005. The $3.8 million write down of the
      aerospace investment is not tax deductible while the realization of tax
      deductibility of the $3.4 million PRC write down, which will be a capital
      loss, is not reasonably assured as the company does not have, nor does it
      anticipate, any capital gains to offset the capital losses.

In
      connection with the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) examination of Ball’s
      consolidated income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2004, the IRS
      has
      proposed to disallow Ball’s deductions of interest expense incurred on loans
      under a company-owned life insurance plan that has been in place for more than
      20 years. Ball believes that its interest deductions will be sustained as
      filed and, therefore, no provision for loss has been recorded. The total
      potential liability for the audit years 1999 through 2004, unaudited year 2005
      and an estimate of the impact on 2006 is approximately $31 million,
      excluding related interest. The IRS has withdrawn its proposed adjustments
      for
      any penalties. See Note 13 accompanying the consolidated financial statements
      within Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Results
      of Equity Affiliates

Equity
      in
      the earnings of affiliates in 2006 is primarily attributable to our
      50 percent ownership in packaging investments in the U.S. and Brazil.
      Earnings in 2004 included the results of a minority-owned aerospace business,
      which was sold in October 2005, and a $15.2 million loss representing
      Ball’s share of a provision for doubtful accounts relating to its
      35 percent interest in Sanshui JFP (discussed above in “Metal
      Beverage Packaging, Europe/Asia”). After consideration of the PRC loss,
      earnings were $14.7 million in 2006 compared to $15.5 million in 2005
      and $15.8 million in 2004.

CRITICAL
      AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING
      PRONOUNCEMENTS

For
      information regarding the company’s critical and significant accounting
      policies, as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the
      consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this
      report.

FINANCIAL
      CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash
      Flows and Capital Expenditures

Cash
      flows from operating activities were $401.4 million in 2006 compared to
      $558.8 million in 2005 and $535.9 million in 2004.

Management
      internally uses a free cash flow measure: (1) to evaluate the company’s
      operating results, (2) for planning purposes, (3) to evaluate
      strategic investments and (4) to evaluate the company’s ability to incur and
      service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. generally accepted
      accounting principles, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash
      flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines
      free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to
      property, plant and equipment (capital spending). Free cash flow is typically
      derived directly from the company’s cash flow statements; however, it may be
      adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods. An example of
      such
      an item included in 2006 is the property insurance proceeds for the replacement
      of the fire-damaged assets in our Hassloch, Germany, plant, which is included
      in
      capital spending amounts.

Based
      on
      this, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows:

Cash
      flows from operating activities in 2006 were negatively affected by higher
      cash
      pension funding and higher working capital levels compared to the prior year.
      The higher working capital was a combination of higher than planned raw material
      inventory levels, higher income tax payments and higher accounts receivable
      balances, the latter resulting primarily from the repayment of a portion of
      the
      accounts receivable securitization program and late payments from customers
      in
      Europe. Management expects the increase in working capital to be temporary
      and
      that working capital levels will return to normal levels by the end of the
      first
      half of 2007.

Cash
      flow
      in 2005 compared to 2004 was negatively impacted by higher cash taxes. This
      resulted in a decrease in deferred income taxes payable of
      $51.6 million in 2005 compared to an estimated increase in deferred
      taxes of $47 million in 2004. The primary causes of the increase in current
      income taxes and decrease in deferred income taxes were the reduction in 2005
      of
      tax-deductible pension costs versus 2004, the impact in 2005 of the repatriation
      of foreign earnings and a reduction of tax versus book depreciation expense
      as
      tax depreciation was accelerated in prior years, primarily due to bonus tax
      depreciation permitted in the tax laws after September 11, 2001. Cash flows
      from operating activities were positively affected in 2005 by lower accounts
      receivable, higher accounts payable and lower pension
      contributions.

Based
      on
      information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating
      activities for 2007 to be approximately $600 million, capital spending (net
      of property insurance recoveries) to be approximately $250 million and free
      cash flow to be in the $350 million range.

Capital
      spending of $218.3 million (net of $61.3 million in insurance
      recoveries) in 2006 was below depreciation and amortization expense of
      $252.6 million. We continue to invest capital in our best performing
      operations, including projects to increase custom can capabilities, improve
      beverage can end making productivity and convert lines from steel to aluminum
      in
      Europe, as well as expenditures in the aerospace and technologies segment.

Debt
      Facilities and Refinancing

Interest-bearing
      debt at December 31, 2006, increased $862 million to
      $2,451.7 million from $1,589.7 million at December 31, 2005. This
      increase includes the issuance by Ball Corporation in March 2006 of
      $450 million of 6.625% senior notes due in 2018 and a
      $500 million increase in bank debt under Ball Corporation’s senior credit
      facilities put in place in the fourth quarter of 2005. The proceeds from these
      financings were used to refinance existing U.S. Can debt at lower interest
      rates, acquire certain net assets of Alcan and reduce seasonal working capital
      debt. Other than acquisition related debt, the 2006 debt increase from 2005
      was
      primarily attributed to changes in foreign exchange rates.

At
      December 31, 2006, $675 million was available under the company’s
      multi-currency revolving credit facilities. The company also had
      $329 million of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at the
      end of the year, of which $140.1 million was outstanding.

On
      October 13, 2005, Ball refinanced its senior secured credit facilities and
      during the third and fourth quarters of 2005, Ball redeemed its 7.75% senior
      notes due August 2006 primarily through the drawdown of funds under the new
      credit facilities. The refinancing and redemption resulted in a pretax debt
      refinancing charge of $19.3 million ($12.3 million after tax) to
      reflect the call premium associated with the senior notes and the write off
      of
      unamortized debt issuance costs.

During
      the first quarter of 2004, Ball repaid €31 million ($38 million) of
      its previous euro denominated Term Loan B and reduced the interest rate by
      50 basis points. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Ball repaid
      $160 million of its previous U.S. dollar denominated Term Loan B and
€25 million of its previous euro denominated Term Loan B. At the time
      of the early repayment, the interest rate on the U.S. portion of the Term
      Loan B was reduced by 50 basis points. Interest expense during the
      first quarter of 2004 included $0.5 million for the write off of the
      unamortized financing costs associated with the repaid loans.

The
      company has a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing,
      revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of Ball’s North
      American packaging operations, up to $225 million. The agreement qualifies
      as off-balance sheet financing under the provisions of Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, as amended by SFAS No. 156.
      Net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled
      $201.3 million and $210 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
      respectively, and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the
      consolidated balance sheets.

The
      company was not in default of any loan agreement at December 31, 2006, and
      has met all payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements, bank credit agreement
      and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions
      relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the
      incurrence of additional indebtedness.

The

      plastic resin and other direct materials. Also included are commitments for
      purchases of natural gas and electricity, aerospace and technologies contracts
      and other less significant items. In cases where variable prices and/or usage
      are involved, management’s best estimates have been used. Depending on the
      circumstances, early termination of the contracts may not result in penalties
      and, therefore, actual payments could vary significantly.

Contributions
      to the company’s defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded
      German plans, are expected to be $69.1 million in 2007. This estimate may
      change based on plan asset performance. Benefit payments related to these plans
      are expected to be $62.6 million, $65.1 million, $68.9 million,
      $73.9 million and $75.1 million for the years ending December 31, 2007
      through 2011, respectively, and $436.7 million combined for 2012 through
      2016. Payments to participants in the unfunded German plans are expected to
      be
      $24.6 million, $25.1 million, $25.5 million, $25.9 million
      and $26.1 million in the years 2007 through 2011, respectively, and a total
      of $136.6 million thereafter.

We
      reduced our share repurchase program in 2006 to $45.7 million, net of
      issuances, compared to $358.1 million net repurchases in 2005 and
      $50 million in 2004. The net repurchases in 2006 did not include a forward
      contract entered into in December 2006 for the repurchase of
      1,200,000 shares. The contract was settled on January 5, 2007, for
      $51.9 million in cash. In 2007 we expect to repurchase approximately
      $175 million, net of issuances, and to reduce debt levels by more than
      $125 million. Annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 40 cents
      per share in 2006 and 2005 and 35 cents per share in 2004. Total dividends
      paid were $41 million in 2006, $42.5 million in 2005 and
      $38.9 million in 2004.

Contingencies

The
      company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course
      of
      business due, in part, to the competitive nature of the industries in which
      we
      participate, our operations in developing markets outside the U.S., changing
      commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our products
      and
      changing capital markets. Where practicable, we attempt to reduce these risks
      and uncertainties through the establishment of risk management policies and
      procedures, including, at times, the use of derivative financial instruments
      as
      explained in Item 7A of this report.

From
      time
      to time, the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its business.
      Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated Ball
      as a
      potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the
      cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Our information at this time does
      not
      indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the
      liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the
      company.

Due
      to
      political and legal uncertainties in Germany, no nationwide system for returning
      beverage containers was in place at the time a mandatory deposit was imposed
      in
      January 2003, and nearly all retailers stopped carrying beverages in
      non-refillable containers. We responded to the resulting lower demand for
      beverage cans with several measures including reducing capacity and converting
      production lines from steel to aluminum to facilitate exports from Germany
      to
      other European countries. Since May 1, 2006, all retailers have been required
      to
      redeem all returned one-way containers as long as they sell such containers.
      Many retailers in Germany have begun the process of implementing a returnable
      system for one-way containers. The retailers and the filling and packaging
      industries have formed a committee to design a nationwide recollection system
      and several retailers have ordered and installed reverse vending machines in
      order to streamline the recollection system. One-way packaging sales by German
      retailers have increased significantly since May 1, 2006 (albeit off a low
      base). We believe it will take some time to recover from the significant
      decrease experienced beginning in 2003. Usage will increase as one-way
      collection systems are more fully developed and consumers become educated
      regarding the systems and the reintroduction of one-way packaging.

The
      preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
      accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
      that
      affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
      contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
      of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future events could affect
      these estimates. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within
      Item 8 of this report for a summary of the company’s critical and
      significant accounting policies.

The
      U.S.
      and European economies have experienced minor general inflation during the
      past
      several years. Management believes that evaluation of Ball’s performance during
      the periods covered by these consolidated financial statements should be based
      upon historical financial statements.

As
      described in Note 13 accompanying the consolidated financial statements
      within Item 8 of this Annual Report, the IRS has proposed to disallow
      Ball’s deductions of interest expense for the tax years 2000 through 2004
      incurred on loans under a company-owned life insurance plan that was established
      in 1986. Ball has disputed the IRS’s claims and the company believes the
      interest deductions will be sustained as filed.

      delays, extensions and technical uncertainties, as well as schedules of
      performance associated with such segment contracts; international business
      and
      market risks such as the devaluation or revaluation of certain currencies and
      the activities of foreign subsidiaries; international business risks (including
      foreign exchange rates and activities of foreign subsidiaries) in Europe and
      particularly in developing countries such as the PRC and Brazil; changes in
      the
      foreign exchange rates of the U.S. dollar against the European euro, British
      pound, Polish zloty, Serbian dinar, Hong Kong dollar, Canadian dollar, Chinese
      renminbi, Brazilian real and Argentine peso, and in the foreign exchange rate
      of
      the European euro against the British pound, Polish zloty and Serbian dinar;
      terrorist activity or war that disrupts the company’s production or supply;
      regulatory action or laws including tax, environmental and workplace safety;
      technological developments and innovations; successful or unsuccessful
      acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures and the integration activities
      associated therewith; changes to unaudited results due to statutory audits
      of
      our financial statements or management’s evaluation of the company’s internal
      controls over financial reporting; and loss contingencies related to income
      and
      other tax matters, including those arising from audits performed by U.S. and
      foreign tax authorities. If the company is unable to achieve its goals, then
      the
      company’s actual performance could vary materially from those goals expressed or
      implied in the forward-looking statements. The company currently does not intend
      to publicly update forward-looking statements except as it deems necessary
      in
      quarterly or annual earnings reports. You are advised, however, to consult
      any
      further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
                Risk

Financial
      Instruments and Risk Management

In
      the
      ordinary course of business, we employ established risk management policies
      and
      procedures to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest
      rates, foreign currencies and prices of the company’s common stock in regard to
      common share repurchases. Although the instruments utilized involve varying
      degrees of credit, market and interest risk, the counterparties to the
      agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the
      agreements.

We
      have
      estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Market risk
      exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative
      instruments, financial instruments and commodity positions. To test the
      sensitivity of our market risk exposure, we have estimated the changes in fair
      value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical
      10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates. The results of the
      sensitivity analysis are summarized below.

Commodity
      Price Risk

We
      manage
      our commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of
      aluminum primarily by entering into container sales contracts which generally
      include aluminum-based pricing terms that consider price fluctuations under
      our
      commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases. Such terms generally include
      a fixed price, floating price or an upper limit to the aluminum component
      pricing. This matched pricing affects substantially all of our metal beverage
      packaging, Americas, net sales. We also, at times, use certain derivative
      instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow and fair value
      hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass-through arrangement
      in
      the sales contract.

Most
      of
      the plastic packaging, Americas, sales contracts negotiated through the end
      of
      2006 include provisions to pass through resin cost changes. As a result, we
      believe we have minimal, if any, exposure related to changes in the cost of
      plastic resin. Most of our metal food and household products packaging,
      Americas, sales contracts negotiated through the end of 2006 either include
      provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we
      incur, or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs. We anticipate that
      we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that
      occur through the end of 2007.

In
      Europe
      and Asia, the company manages aluminum and steel raw material commodity price
      risks through annual and long-term contracts for the purchase of the materials,
      as well as certain sales of containers, that reduce the company’s exposure to
      fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year. These purchase and
      sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass-through pricing
      arrangements. We also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges
      to
      minimize the company’s exposure to significant price changes for those sales
      contracts where there is not a pass-through arrangement.

Considering
      the effects of derivative instruments, the market’s ability to accept price
      increases and the company’s commodity price exposures, a hypothetical
      10 percent adverse change in the company’s steel, aluminum and resin prices
      could result in an estimated $16 million after-tax reduction in net
      earnings over a one-year period. Additionally, if foreign currency exchange
      rates were to change adversely by 10 percent, we estimate there could be a
      $10.2 million after-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year period
      for foreign currency exposures on raw materials. Actual results may vary based
      on actual changes in market prices and rates. Sensitivity to foreign currency
      exposures related to metal increased over prior years due to an increase in
      metal purchases and related payables at our foreign operations, which are
      subject to foreign currency fluctuations.

The
      company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for utilities such as natural
      gas and electricity, as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of
      freight cost. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in our utility prices
      could result in an estimated $8.4 million after-tax reduction of net
      earnings over a one-year period. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in our
      diesel fuel surcharge could result in an estimated $1.9 million after-tax
      reduction of net earnings over the same period. Actual results may vary based
      on
      actual changes in market prices and rates.

Interest
      Rate Risk

Our
      objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact
      of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall
      borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we use a variety of interest
      rate
      swaps and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed-rate debt. Interest
      rate instruments held by the company at December 31, 2006 and 2005, included
      pay-fixed interest rate swaps. Pay-fixed swaps effectively convert variable
      rate
      obligations to fixed rate instruments.

Based
      on
      our interest rate exposure at December 31, 2006, assumed floating rate debt
      levels throughout 2007 and the effects of derivative instruments, a 100 basis
      point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated $9.1 million
      after-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year period. Actual results
      may
      vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these
      changes.

Foreign
      Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Our
      objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect
      foreign cash flows and earnings associated with foreign exchange rate changes
      through the use of cash flow hedges. In addition, we manage foreign earnings
      translation volatility through the use of foreign currency options. Our foreign
      currency translation risk results from the European euro, British pound,
      Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real, Argentine
      peso
      and Serbian dinar. We face currency exposures in our global operations as a
      result of purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars and, to a lesser extent,
      in
      other currencies. Sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect
      cost
      changes and, where there is not a foreign exchange pass-through arrangement,
      the
      company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency
      exposures.

Considering
      the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31,
      2006, and the currency exposures, a hypothetical 10 percent reduction in
      foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar could result in
      an
      estimated $19.2 million after-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year
      period. This amount includes the $10.2 million currency exposure discussed
      above in the “Commodity Price Risk” section. This hypothetical adverse change in
      foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt
      balance by $75.7 million. Actual changes in market prices or rates may
      differ from hypothetical changes.

Common
      Share Repurchases

In
      connection with the company’s ongoing share repurchases, the company
      periodically sells put options which give the purchasers of those options the
      right to sell shares of the company’s common stock to the company on specified
      dates at specified prices upon the exercise of those options. Our objective
      in
      selling put options is to lower the average purchase price of acquired shares.
      There were no put option contracts outstanding at the end of 2006.

Financial
                Statements and Supplementary
                Data

Report
      of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To

the
      Board
      of Directors and Shareholders of Ball Corporation:

We
      have
      completed integrated audits of Ball Corporation’s consolidated financial
      statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December
      31, 2006, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States).

Our
      opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
      f

inancial
      statements

In
      our
      opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index
      appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the
      financial position of Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries

at
      December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash
      flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
      2006,

in
      conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
      of
      America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
      management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
      statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements
      in
      accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
      (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
      to
      obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
      of
      material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining,
      on a
      test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
      made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
      We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
      opinion.

As
      discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
      changed its method of accounting for inventory in 2006.

Internal
      control over financial reporting

Also,
      in
      our opinion, management’s assessment, included in

Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

appearing in Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control
      over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,

based
      on
      criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by
      the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
      is
      fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore,
      in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
      internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
      criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by
      the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
      internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
      effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
      is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of
      the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
      conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
      with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
      States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
      reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
      reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control
      over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control
      over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
      evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
      performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances.
      We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

            36 of

A
      company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
      to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
      (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
      necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
      generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
      of
      the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
      and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
      regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
      or
      disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
      financial statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As
      described in

Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

appearing in Item 9A, management has excluded the operations of U.S. Can
      Corporation (USCan) and operations

of Alcan
      Packaging (Alcan)

from
      its
      assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
      2006,
      because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations
      during 2006. We have also excluded USCan and Alcan from our audit of internal
      control over financial reporting. USCan and Alcan are operated by wholly-owned
      subsidiaries of the Company and had combined assets and combined net sales
      representing 17 percent and 8 percent, respectively, of the related
      consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December
      31, 2006.

      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Ball
      Corporation and Subsidiaries

1.  
      Critical and Significant Accounting Policies

In
      the
      application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
      of
      America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect
      the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingencies
      and
      reported amounts of revenues and expenses. These estimates are based on
      historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable
      under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under
      different assumptions or conditions.

Critical
      Accounting Policies

The
      company considers certain accounting policies to be critical, as their
      application requires management’s best judgment in making estimates about the
      effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Following is a discussion
      of
      the accounting policies we consider critical to our consolidated financial
      statements.

Revenue
      Recognition in the Aerospace and Technologies Segment

Sales
      under long-term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment are
      recognized under the cost-to-cost, percentage-of-completion method. This
      business segment sells using two types of long-term sales contracts - cost-type
      sales contracts, which represent approximately two-thirds of sales, and
      fixed price sales contracts which account for the remainder. A cost-type sales
      contract is an agreement to perform the contract for cost plus an agreed upon
      profit component, whereas fixed price sales contracts are completed for a fixed
      price or involve the sale of engineering labor at fixed rates per hour.
      Cost-type sales contracts can have different types of fee arrangements,
      including fixed fee, cost, milestone and performance incentive fees, award
      fees
      or a combination thereof.

During
      initial periods of sales contract performance, our estimates of base, incentive
      and other fees are established at a conservative estimate of profit over the
      period of contract performance. Throughout the period of contract performance,
      we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of total
      contract revenue, total contract cost and extent of progress toward completion.
      Provision for estimated contract losses, if any, is made in the period that
      such
      losses are determined to be probable. Because of sales contract payment
      schedules, limitations on funding and contract terms, our sales and accounts
      receivable generally include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.
      As a prime U.S. government contractor or subcontractor, the aerospace and
      technologies segment is subject to a high degree of regulation, financial review
      and oversight by the U.S. government.

Acquisitions

The
      company accounts for acquisitions using the purchase method as required by
      Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, “Business
      Combinations.” Under SFAS No. 141, the acquiring company allocates the
      purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
      estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, including intangible assets
      that can be identified and named. The purchase price in excess of the fair
      value
      of the net assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.

Among
      other sources of relevant information, the company uses independent appraisals
      and actuarial or other valuations to assist in determining the estimated fair
      values of the assets and liabilities.

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets

We
      evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually, and we evaluate our other
      intangible assets whenever there is evidence that certain events or changes
      in
      circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be
      recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a fair value approach,
      using discounted cash flows to establish fair values. We recognize an impairment
      charge for any amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its
      fair
      value. When available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples
      to
      corroborate discounted cash flow results. When a business within a reporting
      unit is disposed of, goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition
      using the relative fair value methodology.

      Critical and Significant Accounting Policies

(continued)

We
      amortize the cost of other intangibles over their estimated useful lives unless
      such lives are deemed indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are tested
      for
      impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down
      to
      fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. Intangible
      assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment and written
      down
      to fair value as required.

Defined
      Benefit Pension Plans and Other Employee Benefits

The
      company has defined benefit plans that cover the majority of its employees.
      We
      also have postretirement plans that provide certain medical benefits and life
      insurance for retirees and eligible dependents. The accounting for these plans
      is subject to the guidance provided in SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting
      for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of
      FASB
      Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R);” SFAS No. 87, “Employers’
      Accounting for Pensions,” and SFAS No. 106, “Employers' Accounting for
      Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.” These statements require that
      management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of return
      on
      plan assets, discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses,
      salary scale inflation rates, health care cost trend rates, mortality and other
      assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension
      and
      postretirement plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly
      susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan
      assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions and contracted benefit changes.
      The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic
      and market conditions at the time of valuation. However, actual results may
      differ substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical
      assumptions.

Pension
      plan liabilities are revalued annually based on updated assumptions and
      information about the individuals covered by the plan. For pension plans,
      accumulated gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor, the prior
      service cost and the transition asset are amortized on a straight-line basis
      from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active
      participants. For other postemployment benefits, the 10 percent corridor is
      not used.

In
      addition to defined benefit and postretirement plans, the company maintains
      reserves for employee medical claims, up to our insurance stop-loss limit,
      and
      workers’ compensation claims. These are regularly evaluated and revised, as
      needed, based on a variety of information, including historical experience,
      third party actuarial estimates and current employee statistics.

Taxes
      on Income

Deferred
      tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carry
      forwards, are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
      management, it is more likely than not that any portion of these tax attributes
      will not be realized. In addition, from time to time, management must assess
      the
      need to accrue or disclose a possible loss contingency for proposed adjustments
      from various federal, state and foreign tax authorities that regularly audit
      the
      company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments,
      management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions,
      including many foreign jurisdictions.

Deferred
      income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the
      tax
      bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each
      balance sheet date, based upon enacted income tax laws and tax rates. Income
      tax
      expense or benefit is provided based on earnings reported in the financial
      statements. The provision for income tax expense or benefit differs from the
      amounts of income taxes currently payable because certain items of income and
      expense included in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in
      different time periods by taxing authorities.

Business
      Consolidation Costs

The
      company estimates its liabilities for business consolidation activities by
      accumulating detailed estimates of costs and asset sales proceeds, if any,
      for
      each business consolidation initiative. This includes the estimated costs of
      employee severance, pension and related benefits; impairment of property and
      equipment and other assets, including estimates of realizable value; contract
      termination payments for contracts and leases; contractual obligations and
      any
      other qualifying costs related to the exit plan. These estimated costs are
      grouped by specific projects within the overall exit plan and are then monitored
      on a monthly basis. Such disclosures represent management’s best estimates, but
      require assumptions about the plans that may change over time. Changes in
      estimates for individual locations and other matters are evaluated periodically
      to determine if a change in estimate is required for the overall restructuring
      plan. Subsequent changes to the original estimates are included in current
      period earnings and identified as business consolidation gains or
      losses.

Significant
      Accounting Policies

Principles
      of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The
      consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ball Corporation
      and
      its controlled subsidiaries (collectively, Ball, the company, we or our). Equity
      investments in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control
      and
      are not the primary beneficiary, are accounted for using the equity method
      of
      accounting. Investments in which we do not exercise significant influence over
      the investee are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Intercompany
      transactions are eliminated.

Cash
      Equivalents

Cash
      equivalents have original maturities of three months or less.

Inventories

Inventories
      are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
      cost method of accounting. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2006, the majority
      of
      the U.S. inventories in the metal beverage packaging, Americas, and metal food
      and household products packaging, Americas, segments were accounted for using
      the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting. During the fourth quarter
      of
      2006, management changed its method of accounting for these inventories
      from the LIFO method to the FIFO method. The FIFO method of inventory
      accounting better matches revenues and expenses in accordance with sales
      contract terms. All periods have been retrospectively adjusted on a FIFO basis
      in accordance with SFAS No. 154. Additional details are available in
      Note 7.

Depreciation
      and Amortization

Property,
      plant and equipment are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction
      and
      depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation and
      amortization are provided using the straight-line method in amounts sufficient
      to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives (buildings
      and improvements - 15 to 40 years; machinery and equipment - 5 to
      15 years; other intangible assets - 13 years, weighted
      average).

Deferred
      financing costs are amortized over the life of the related loan facility and
      are
      reported as part of interest expense. When debt is repaid prior to its maturity
      date, the write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs is
      also reported as interest expense.

Environmental
      Reserves

We
      estimate the liability related to environmental matters based on, among other
      factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability
      to
      make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. We record our best estimate
      of
      a loss when the loss is considered probable. As additional information becomes
      available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending matters
      and
      revise our estimates.

Revenue
      Recognition in the Packaging Segments

Sales
      of
      products in the packaging segments are recognized when delivery has occurred
      and
      title has transferred, there is persuasive evidence of an agreement or
      arrangement, the price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably
      assured.

Stock-Based
      Compensation

Ball
      has
      a variety of restricted stock and stock option plans. With the exception of
      the
      company’s deposit share program, which through 2005 was accounted for as a
      variable plan and is discussed in Note 15, the compensation cost associated
      with
      restricted stock grants has been calculated using the fair value at the date
      of
      grant and amortized over the restriction period. In the fourth quarter of 2006,
      Ball amended one of its deferred compensation stock plans to allow limited
      diversification, which required an initial mark-to-market adjustment of
      $6.7 million. Stock-based compensation is reported as part of selling,
      general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
      earnings.

Effective
      January 1, 2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),
“Share-Based Payment,” and elected to use the modified prospective transition
      method and the Black-Scholes valuation model. Tax benefits associated with
      option exercises are reported in financing activities in the consolidated
      statements of cash flows beginning in 2006. Prior to January 1, 2006,
      expense related to stock options was calculated using the intrinsic value method
      under the guidelines of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,
      and has therefore not been included in the consolidated statements of earnings
      in 2005 or 2004. Ball’s earnings as reported included after-tax stock-based
      compensation of $6.6 million and $12.5 million for the years ended
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. If the fair value based method
      had been used, after-tax stock-based compensation would have been
      $8.7 million in 2005 and $9.3 million in 2004, and diluted earnings
      per share would have been lower by $0.02 in 2005 and higher by $0.03 in 2004.
      Further details regarding the expense calculated under the fair value based
      method are provided in Note 15.

Foreign
      Currency Translation

Assets
      and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using period-end exchange
      rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates
      during each period. Translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated
      other comprehensive earnings as a component of shareholders’
      equity.

Derivative
      Financial Instruments

The
      company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging
      exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
      product sales, raw materials purchasing and common share repurchases. The
      company’s derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets
      at fair value. For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge of a recognized
      asset or liability, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period
      of
      change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable
      to the risk being hedged. For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge,
      or a
      derivative designated as a fair value hedge of a firm commitment not yet
      recorded on the balance sheet, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or
      loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
      earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted
      transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss
      associated with all

hedges
      is
      reported in earnings immediately. In the statements of cash flows, hedge
      activities are classified in the same category as the items being
      hedged.

Realized
      gains and losses from hedges are classified in the consolidated statements
      of
      earnings consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged.
      Gains and losses upon the early termination of effective derivative contracts
      are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive earnings and amortized to
      earnings in the same period as the originally hedged items affect
      earnings.

Reclassifications

Certain
      prior year amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to the current
      year presentation.

New
      Accounting Pronouncements

In
      September 2006 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
      SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
      Other Postretirement Plans - an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88,
      106 and 132(R),” which was effective in Ball’s annual report for the year ended
      December 31, 2006. The new standard requires employers to recognize the
      overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as
      an
      asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize
      changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through
      other comprehensive earnings. It also requires disclosure of certain effects
      on
      net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed
      recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and
      transition assets or obligations. The effects of Ball’s adoption of this
      standard are detailed in Note 14, “Employee Benefit
      Obligations.”

Also
      in
      September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
      Measurements,” which establishes a framework for measuring value and expands
      disclosures about fair value measurements. Although it does not require any
      new
      fair value measurements, the statement emphasizes that fair value is a
      market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and should be
      determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in
      pricing the asset or liability. The standard will be effective for Ball as
      of
      January 1, 2008.

Staff
      Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108 was issued in September 2006 by the
      Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) addressing the SEC staff’s view
      regarding the process of consideration of the effects of prior year
      misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of
      materiality. The company’s process is consistent with the SEC’s
      view.

In
      June 2006 the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB
      Statement No. 109,” which prescribes a recognition threshold and
      measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement
      of
      a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 became
      effective for Ball beginning on January 1, 2007. The company is evaluating
      the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.
      While adoption of this standard will require balance sheet reclassifications
      of
      the accruals for uncertain tax positions and a cumulative adjustment for the
      retrospective application of the standard, at the time of this filing the
      company is unable to determine the impact of any reclassifications or to
      determine whether the cumulative adjustment is material.

In
      March 2006 the Emerging Issues Task Force of the FASB reached a consensus
      on Issue No. 06-3 regarding whether taxes collected from customers and
      remitted to governmental authorities are presented in a company’s income
      statement (a gross presentation) or only in its balance sheet (a net
      presentation). The decision, which is effective for Ball’s reporting beginning
      January 1, 2007, requires a company to disclose its policy for recording
      and reporting such taxes (gross or net) and, if on a gross basis, the amounts
      that are included in revenues and costs in the statement of earnings. Ball’s
      current policy is to record taxes collected from customers as liabilities on
      its
      consolidated balance sheet and not in its consolidated statement of
      earnings.

1.  
      Critical and Significant Accounting Policies

(continued)

In
      May 2005 the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error
      Corrections - a Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement
      No. 3.” The new standard changes the requirements for the accounting for
      and reporting of a change in accounting principle and applies to all such
      voluntary changes. The previous accounting required that most changes in
      accounting principle be recognized in net earnings by including a cumulative
      effect of the change in the period of the change. SFAS No. 154, which was
      effective for Ball beginning January 1, 2006, requires retroactive
      application to prior periods’ financial statements. The company applied
      SFAS No. 154 to its change from the LIFO to the FIFO method of
      accounting for certain inventories, which occurred in the fourth quarter of
      .

In
      December 2004 the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),
“Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) is a revision
      of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and
      supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”
      The new standard, which was effective for Ball beginning January 1, 2006,
      establishes accounting standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges
      its equity instruments for goods or services, including stock option and
      restricted stock grants. On March 29, 2005, the SEC issued SAB
      No. 107, which summarizes the views of the SEC staff regarding the
      interaction between SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) and certain SEC rules and
      regulations and provides the SEC staff’s views regarding the valuation of
      share-based payment arrangements for public companies. Upon the adoption of
      the
      standard, Ball elected to use the modified prospective transition method and
      the
      Black-Scholes valuation model. The adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised
      2004) resulted in higher stock-based compensation in 2006 of $6.3 million
      compared to 2005. Additional effects on the company’s consolidated financial
      statements of adopting SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) are discussed in
      Note 15.

In
      November 2004 the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs - an
      amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.” SFAS No. 151 requires abnormal
      amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material
      (spoilage) to be recognized as current-period charges. It also requires that
      the
      allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based
      on
      the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 was
      effective for inventory costs incurred by Ball beginning on January 1,
      2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 had an insignificant effect on
      Ball’s consolidated financial statements.

2.  
      Business Segment Information

Ball’s
      operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines
      in
      five reportable segments:

Metal
      beverage packaging, Americas

2.  
      Business Segment Information

(continued)

During
      the fourth quarter of 2006, Ball’s management changed its method of inventory
      accounting from LIFO to FIFO in the metal beverage, Americas, and the metal
      food
      and household products packaging, Americas, segments. Segment results for all
      periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted on a FIFO basis in
      accordance with SFAS No. 154 (see Notes 1 and 7). In the third quarter
      of 2006, the company changed its expense allocation method by allocating to
      each
      of the packaging segments stock-based compensation expense previously included
      in corporate undistributed expenses. The change did not have a significant
      impact on any segment for the current or prior years. Prior periods have been
      conformed to the current presentation of the segments and the change in expense
      allocation.

The
      accounting policies of the segments are the same as those in the condensed
      consolidated financial statements. We also have investments in companies in
      the
      U.S., PRC and Brazil, which are accounted for under the equity method of
      accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales
      or
      earnings.

      Acquisitions


U.S.
      Can Corporation

On
      March 27, 2006, Ball acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of
      U.S. Can Corporation (U.S. Can) for consideration of 444,756 common shares
      of Ball Corporation (valued at $44.28 per share for a total of
      $19.7 million). In connection with the acquisition, Ball also refinanced
      $598.2 million of U.S. Can debt, including $26.8 million of bond
      redemption premiums and fees, and over the next several years expects to realize
      approximately $42 million for acquired net operating tax loss
      carryforwards. The U.S. Can debt was refinanced at significantly lower interest
      rates through the issuance of a new series of Ball Corporation senior notes
      and
      an increase in Ball Corporation bank debt under the senior credit facilities
      put
      in place in the fourth quarter of 2005 (see Note 12). This acquisition
      added to the company’s portfolio of rigid packaging products and provides a
      meaningful position in a sizeable product line. As a result of this acquisition,
      Ball became the largest manufacturer of aerosol cans in North America and now
      produces aerosol cans, paint cans, plastic containers and custom and specialty
      cans in nine plants in the U.S. and aerosol cans in two plants in
      Argentina. The newly acquired operations formed part of Ball’s metal food and
      household products packaging, Americas, segment during 2006. Responsibility
      for
      the U.S. Can plastic container business was transferred to the company’s plastic
      packaging, Americas, segment effective

3.  
      Acquisitions

(continued)

January 1,
      2007. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly,
      its
      results have been included in the consolidated financial statements since
      March 27, 2006.

Alcan
      Packaging

On
      March 28, 2006, Ball acquired North American plastic bottle container
      assets from Alcan Packaging (Alcan) for $184.7 million cash. The acquired
      assets included two plastic container manufacturing plants in the U.S. and
      one
      in Canada, as well as certain manufacturing equipment and other assets from
      other Alcan facilities. This acquisition strengthens the company’s plastic
      container business and complements its food container business. The acquired
      business primarily manufactures and sells barrier polypropylene plastic bottles
      used in food packaging and, to a lesser extent, barrier PET plastic bottles
      used
      for beverages and food. The acquired operations formed part of Ball’s plastic
      packaging, Americas, segment during 2006. The acquisition has been accounted
      for
      as a purchase and, accordingly, its results have been included in the
      consolidated financial statements since March 28, 2006.

Following
      is a summary of the net assets acquired in the U.S. Can and Alcan transactions
      using preliminary fair values. The valuation by management of certain assets,
      including identification and valuation of acquired fixed assets and intangible
      assets, and of liabilities, including development and assessment of associated
      costs of consolidation and integration plans, is still in process and,
      therefore, the actual fair values may vary from the preliminary estimates.
      Final
      valuations will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2007. The
      company has engaged third party experts to assist management in valuing certain
      assets and liabilities including inventory; property, plant and equipment;
      intangible assets and pension and other post-retirement
      obligations.

The
      customer relationships and acquired technologies of both acquisitions were
      identified as valuable intangible assets by an independent valuation firm and
      assigned an estimated life of 20 years by the company based on the
      valuation firm’s estimates. Because the acquisition of U.S. Can was a stock
      purchase, neither the goodwill nor the intangible assets are tax deductible
      for
      U.S. income tax purposes. However, because the Alcan acquisition was an asset
      purchase, both the goodwill and the intangible assets are deductible for U.S.
      tax purposes.

        high-density plastic container business for $4.6 million in cash. The
        acquisition of the minority interest was not significant to the
        company.

      - Ball Western Can Company (Ball Western Can)

On
      March 17, 2004, Ball acquired ConAgra Grocery Products Company’s (ConAgra)
      interest in Ball Western Can for $30 million. Ball Western Can, located in
      Oakdale, California, was established in 2000 as a 50/50 joint venture between
      Ball and ConAgra and, prior to the acquisition, was accounted for by Ball using
      the equity method of accounting. The acquisition has been accounted for as
      a
      purchase and, accordingly, its results have been consolidated in our financial
      statements from the acquisition date. Contemporaneous with the acquisition,
      Ball
      and ConAgra’s parent company, ConAgra Foods Inc., entered into a long-term
      agreement under which Ball provides metal food containers to ConAgra
      manufacturing locations in California. The acquisition of Ball Western Can
      was
      not significant to the company.

      Business Consolidation Activities

(continued)


Metal
      Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas

In
      October 2006 the company announced plans to close two manufacturing
      facilities in North America as part of the realignment of the metal food and
      household products packaging, Americas, segment following the acquisition
      earlier in the year of U.S. Can. The company closed a leased facility in
      Alliance, Ohio, which was one of 10 manufacturing locations acquired from
      U.S. Can, and a food can plant in Burlington, Ontario. A pretax charge of
      $33.6 million ($27.4 million after tax) was recorded in the fourth
      quarter related to the Burlington closure, comprised of $7.8 million of
      severance costs, $16.8 million of pension costs, $2.9 million of plant
      decommissioning costs and $6.1 million for the write off of obsolete
      equipment and related spare parts and tooling. The closure of the Ohio plant,
      estimated to cost approximately $1 million for employee and other costs, has
      been treated as an opening balance sheet item related to the acquisition. The
      company continues to evaluate the current manufacturing structure and expects
      to
      identify other opportunities to improve efficiencies by further realigning
      production capacities.

The
      fourth quarter also included a net charge of $0.9 million
      ($0.6 million after tax) to shut down a welded food can line at the
      Richmond, British Columbia, plant and record the recovery of business
      consolidation costs previously expensed.

In
      the
      second quarter, earnings of $0.4 million ($0.2 million after tax) were
      recorded to reflect the excess proceeds on the disposition of fixed assets
      previously written down in a 2005 business consolidation charge.

In
      the
      first quarter, a pretax charge of $2.1 million ($1.4 million after
      tax) was recorded to shut down a metal food can production line in the Whitby,
      Ontario, plant. The charge was comprised of $0.6 million of employee
      termination costs, $0.7 million for equipment removal and other
      decommissioning costs and $0.8 million for impairment of plant equipment
      and related spares and tooling. Production from the line has ceased and other
      related activities were completed during 2006. The fourth quarter of 2006
      included $0.7 million of earnings ($0.5 million after tax) to reflect
      the net proceeds on the disposition of the plant’s fixed assets.

Plastic
      Packaging, Americas

An
      opening balance sheet reserve of $1.6 million was recorded related to the
      closure and relocation of the former Alcan research and development facility
      from Neenah, Wisconsin, to Westminster, Colorado, and the shut down of
      production and relocation of equipment from Alcan’s Newark, California, plant to
      other Ball plants.


Metal
      Beverage Packaging, Americas

The
      company announced in July 2005 the commencement of a project to upgrade and
      streamline its North American beverage can end manufacturing capabilities.
      The
      project is expected to be completed in 2008 and will result in productivity
      gains and cost reductions. A pretax charge of $19.3 million
      ($11.7 million after tax) was recorded in the third quarter of 2005 in
      connection with this project. The pretax charge includes $11.7 million for
      employee severance, pension and other employee benefit costs; $1.6 million
      for decommissioning costs and $6 million for the write off of obsolete
      equipment spare parts and tooling. Payments of $1.1 million were made in
      2006 against the reserve.

Metal
      Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas

In
      the
      fourth quarter, a pretax charge of $4.6 million ($3.1 million after
      tax) was recorded for pension, severance and other employee benefit costs
      related to a reduction in force in our Burlington, Ontario, plant. At
      December 31, 2006, the resulting reserve had been reduced by
      $1.5 million of cash payments made.

In
      the
      second quarter, a pretax charge of $8.8 million ($5.9 million after
      tax) was recorded in connection with the closure of a three-piece food can
      manufacturing plant in Baie d’Urfe, Quebec. The Quebec plant was closed and
      ceased operations in the third quarter of 2005, and the sale of the plant
      resulted in the second quarter charge being offset by a $2.2 million gain
      ($1.5 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2005 to adjust the plant
      to net realizable value. At December 31, 2006, the resulting reserve had
      been reduced by $1.6 million of cash payments made. The pretax charge, net
      of the offsetting gain, included $3.2 million for employee severance,
      pension and other employee benefit costs and $3.4 million for
      decommissioning costs and the write-down to net realizable value of fixed assets
      and other costs.

Metal
      Beverage Packaging, Europe/Asia

The
      company recorded $9.3 million of earnings in 2005, primarily related to the
      final settlement of tax obligations, and an adjustment to reclassify an asset
      to
      be put in service previously held for sale, related to a $237.7 million business
      consolidation charge taken in the second quarter of 2001. Tax clearances from
      the applicable authorities were required during the formal liquidation process.
      These matters have been concluded.


In
      $15.2 million of earnings were recorded to reflect the recovery of business
      consolidation costs previously expensed, primarily related to realization of
      assets in the PRC in excess of amounts previously estimated and costs of
      consolidation and liquidation of closed PRC operations related to the 2001
      charge.

5.  
      Property Insurance Gain

On
      April 1, 2006, a fire in the metal beverage can plant in Hassloch, Germany,
      damaged the majority of the building and machinery and equipment. In
      November 2006 the company reached final agreement with the insurance
      carrier on property insurance recoveries. The agreed upon property insurance
      proceeds recorded for the year ended December 31, 2006, which are based on
      replacement cost, were €86.3 million ($109.3 million), of which
€26 million ($32.4 million) was received in April 2006,
€22.7 million ($28.9 million) was received in October 2006 and
      the remainder of €37.6 million ($49.6 million), which was recorded in
      other long-term assets, was received in January 2007. A €26.7 million
      ($33.8 million) fixed asset write down was recorded to reflect the
      estimated impairment of the assets damaged as a result of the fire. As a result,
      gains of €58.4 million ($74.1 million pretax) and €2.2 million
      ($2.8 million pretax) were recorded in the consolidated statement of
      earnings in the second and third quarters, respectively, to reflect the
      difference between the net book value of the impaired assets and the property
      insurance proceeds. Upon reaching final agreement, a pretax reduction to the
      insurance gain of €1 million ($1.4 million) was recorded in the fourth
      quarter. Additional amounts of €15 million ($19 million),
€13 million ($16.5 million) and €12 million ($15.5 million)
      were recorded in cost of sales in the second, third and fourth quarters,
      respectively, for insurance recoveries related to business interruption costs,
      as well as €11.3 million ($14.3 million) to offset clean-up costs. An
      additional €27 million of business interruption recoveries has been agreed
      upon with the insurance carrier and will be recognized in 2007.

In
      June 2006 the company announced its intention to rebuild the Hassloch plant
      with two steel lines and to add an aluminum line in its Hermsdorf, Germany,
      plant. All three lines are expected to be operational during the second quarter
      of 2007.

6.  
      Accounts Receivable

Accounts
      receivable are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $9.8 million at
      December 31, 2006, and $13.4 million at December 31,
      2005.

A
      receivables sales agreement provides for the ongoing, revolving sale of a
      designated pool of trade accounts receivable of Ball’s North American packaging
      operations of up to $225 million. The agreement qualifies as off-balance
      sheet financing under the provisions of SFAS No. 140, as amended by
      SFAS No. 156. Net funds received from the sale of the accounts
      receivable totaled $201.3 million and $210 million at
      December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are reflected as a reduction
      of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. Fees incurred in
      connection with the sale of accounts receivable, which are reported as part
      of
      selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $9.7 million in 2006,
      $7.7 million in 2005 and $3.2 million in 2004.

Net
      accounts receivable under long-term contracts, due primarily from agencies
      of
      the U.S. government and their prime contractors, were $125.3 million and
      $121.7 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and
      included $62.4 million and $70.8 million, respectively, representing
      the recognized sales value of performance that had not been billed and was
      not
      yet billable to customers. The average length of the long-term contracts is
      3.3
      years and the average length remaining on those contracts at December 31,
      2006, was 16 months. Approximately $1.3 million of unbilled
      receivables at December 31, 2006, is expected to be collected after
      one year and is related to customary fees and cost withholdings that will be
      paid upon milestone or contract completions, as well as final overhead rate
      settlements.

Historically
      the cost of the majority of metal beverage packaging, Americas, and metal
      food and household products packaging, Americas, inventories were determined
      using the LIFO method of accounting. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the
      company determined that the FIFO method of inventory accounting better matches
      revenues and expenses in accordance with sales contract terms. Therefore, in
      the
      fourth quarter of 2006, the accounting policy was changed to record all
      inventories using the FIFO method of accounting. For comparative purposes,
      all
      periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted on a FIFO basis in
      accordance with SFAS No. 154, resulting in a $1 million increase
      in retained earnings as of January 1, 2004.

The
      following table summarizes the effect of the accounting change on the company’s
      consolidated financial statements:

If

      cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2006, would have been
      $14.7 million higher than reported in the consolidated statement of
      earnings, the tax provision would have been $5.8 million lower and net
      earnings would have been $8.9 million lower.  On a per share basis,
      basic earnings per share would have been lower by $0.09 and diluted earnings
      per
      share would have been lower by $0.08.

      2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Based on intangible assets and foreign
      currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2006, total annual intangible asset
      amortization expense is expected to be approximately $14 million in each of
      the years 2007 through 2009 and approximately $5 million in both 2010 and
      2011. The increase in intangibles is due primarily to preliminary estimates
      of
      the fair market values of customer relationships acquired in the U.S. Can and
      Alcan acquisitions (as discussed in Note 3).

In
      the
      first quarter of 2005, selling, general and administrative expenses included
      $3.8 million for the write down to net realizable value of an equity
      investment in an aerospace company. The remaining carrying amount of
      $14 million was reclassified to other current assets and was sold in
      October 2005 for $7 million cash and a $7.2 million
      interest-bearing note that was paid during 2006. Also included in the first
      quarter of 2005 was an expense of $3.4 million for the full write off of a
      PRC joint venture equity investment.

11.

      technologies segment. During 2005 and 2003, we entered into leases which qualify
      as operating leases for book purposes and capital leases for tax purposes.
      Under
      these lease arrangements, Ball has the option to purchase the leased equipment
      at the end of the lease term, or if we elect not to do so, to compensate the
      lessors for the difference between the guaranteed minimum residual values
      totaling $16.3 million and the fair market value of the assets, if less.
      Certain of the company’s leases in effect at December 31, 2006, include
      renewal options and/or escalation clauses for adjusting lease expense based
      on
      various factors.

Total
      noncancellable operating leases in effect at December 31, 2006, require rental
      payments of $45 million, $32.8 million, $25.7 million,
      $21.7 million and $17 million for the years 2007 through 2011,
      respectively, and $43.7 million combined for all years thereafter. Lease
      expense for all operating leases was $83.1 million, $74 million and
      $71.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

12.  
      Debt and Interest Costs

(continued)


On
      March 27, 2006, Ball expanded its senior secured credit facilities with the
      addition of a new $500 million Term D Loan facility due in
      installments through October 2011. Also on March 27, 2006, Ball issued
      at a price of 99.799 percent $450 million of new 6.625% senior notes
      (effective yield to maturity of 6.65 percent) due in March 2018. The
      proceeds from these financings were used to refinance existing U.S. Can debt
      with Ball Corporation debt at lower interest rates, acquire certain North
      American plastic container net assets from Alcan and reduce seasonal working
      capital debt.

The
      senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and also include
      (1) a multi-currency, long-term revolving credit facility which provides
      the company with up to the equivalent of $715 million and (2) a
      Canadian long-term revolving credit facility which provides the company with
      up
      to the equivalent of $35 million. Both revolving credit facilities expire
      in October 2011. At December 31, 2006, taking into account outstanding
      letters of credit, $675 million was available under the revolving credit
      facilities.

Maturities
      of all long-term debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2006, are
      $41.2 million, $126.8 million, $154 million, $369.7 million
      and $603.6 million for the years ending December 31, 2007 through 2011,
      respectively, and $1,013.9 million thereafter. Ball provides letters of
      credit in the ordinary course of business to secure liabilities recorded in
      connection with industrial development revenue bonds and certain self-insurance
      arrangements. Letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
      were
      $52.4 million and $34 million, respectively.

The
      notes
      payable and senior credit facilities are guaranteed on a full, unconditional
      and
      joint and several basis by certain of the company’s domestic wholly owned
      subsidiaries. Certain foreign denominated tranches of the senior credit
      facilities are similarly guaranteed by certain of the company’s wholly owned
      foreign subsidiaries. Note 20 contains further details as well as
      condensed, consolidating financial information for the company, segregating
      the
      guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries.

The
      company was not in default of any loan agreement at December 31, 2006, and
      has
      met all debt payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements, bank credit
      agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain
      restrictions relating to dividend payments, share repurchases, investments,
      financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness.


On
      October 13, 2005, Ball refinanced its senior secured credit facilities
      to extend debt maturities at lower interest rate spreads and provide the company
      with additional borrowing capacity for future growth. During the third and
      fourth quarters of 2005, Ball redeemed its 7.75% senior notes due in August
      2006. The refinancing and senior note redemptions resulted in a debt refinancing
      charge of $19.3 million ($12.3 million after tax) for the related call
      premium and unamortized debt issuance costs.


During
      the first quarter of 2004, Ball repaid €31 million ($38 million) of
      its previous euro denominated Term Loan B and reduced the interest rate by
      50 basis points. Interest expense during the first quarter of 2004 included
      $0.5 million for the write off of the unamortized financing costs
      associated with the repaid loans.

      up
      to €39.5 million of income tax. At December 31, 2006, the remaining
      tax exemption available to reduce future Polish tax liability was
€0.7 million. In 2005 Ball Packaging Europe’s Serbian subsidiary was
      granted a tax holiday. Under the terms of the holiday, the earnings of this
      subsidiary will be exempt from income taxation for a period of 10 years
      beginning in the first year the Serbian subsidiary has taxable earnings. As
      of
      December 31, 2006, the 10-year period had not commenced.

Net

The
      change in deferred taxes during 2006 is primarily attributable to tax
      depreciation exceeding book depreciation, the effect of the accounting method
      change from LIFO to FIFO for certain inventories, an increase in net operating
      loss carryforwards and the effects of foreign currency exchange
      rates.

As
      discussed in Note 7, the company changed its method of accounting for
      certain inventories from the LIFO method to the FIFO method. Under the book-tax
      conformity rules of the Internal Revenue Code, in 2007 the company will also
      be
      required to change its method of accounting for inventories for U.S. tax
      purposes from LIFO to FIFO.

The impact of the tax accounting change
      will be included in the company’s income tax return over the next several
      years.

At
      December 31, 2006, Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries had net operating
      loss carryforwards, expiring between 2020 and 2026, of $71.5 million with a
      related tax benefit of $29 million. At December 31, 2006, Ball
      Packaging Europe and its subsidiaries had net operating loss carryforwards,
      with
      no expiration date, of $50.8 million with a related tax benefit of
      $13.1 million. Also at December 31, 2006, Ball Packaging Products
      Canada Corp. had a net operating loss carryforward, with no expiration date,
      of
      $14.5 million with a related tax benefit of $4.8 million. Due to the
      uncertainty of ultimate realization, these European and Canadian benefits have
      been offset by valuation allowances of $4.8 million each. Any realization
      of the European valuation allowance will be recognized as a reduction in
      goodwill. At December 31, 2006, the company has foreign tax credit
      carryforwards of $5.8 million; however, due to the uncertainty of
      realization of the entire credit, a valuation allowance of $3.8 million has
      been applied to reduce the carrying value to $2 million.

In
      connection with the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) examination of Ball’s
      consolidated income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2004, the IRS
      has
      proposed to disallow Ball’s deductions of interest expense incurred on loans
      under a company-owned life insurance plan that has been in place for more than
      20 years. Ball believes that its interest deductions will be sustained as
      filed and, therefore, no provision for loss has been recorded. The total
      potential liability for the audit years 1999 through 2004, unaudited year 2005
      and an estimate of the impact on 2006 is approximately $31 million,
      excluding related interest. The IRS has withdrawn its proposed adjustments
      for
      any penalties.

13.  
      Taxes on Income

(continued)

On
      October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act) was
      signed into law. The Jobs Act provided certain domestic companies a temporary
      opportunity to repatriate previously undistributed earnings of controlled
      foreign subsidiaries at a reduced federal tax rate, approximating
      5.25 percent. The reduced rate was achieved via an 85 percent
      dividends received deduction on earnings repatriated during a one-year period
      on
      or before December 31, 2005.

In
      July
      2005 the company’s chief executive officer approved a foreign dividend and
      capital distribution plan that included the repatriation of undistributed
      earnings of certain of its foreign subsidiaries during the third and fourth
      quarters of 2005. The applicable domestic reinvestment plans were approved
      by
      the chief executive officer, in advance of distributions, and subsequently
      approved by the board of directors as required under the Jobs Act. Under the
      plan, the distribution was $488.4 million, of which approximately $320.3 million
      was taxable and subject to the provisions of the Jobs Act. In the third quarter
      of 2005, the company recorded a current tax payable of $16 million that was
      more
      than offset by the release of $19.2 million of accrued taxes on prior year
      unremitted foreign earnings, resulting in a net decrease in tax expense of

      million for that period.

Notwithstanding
      the 2005 distribution pursuant to the Jobs Act, management’s intention is to
      indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings. Subsequent to the aforementioned Jobs
      Act distribution, substantially all of the previously undistributed earnings
      of
      Ball’s controlled foreign corporations have been distributed; therefore, no
      deferred tax provision would be required at December 31, 2006 or 2005.

The
      company’s pension plans cover substantially all U.S., Canadian and European
      employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. The defined benefit plans
      for salaried employees, as well as those for hourly employees in Germany and
      the
      United Kingdom, provide pension benefits based on employee compensation and
      years of service. Plans for North American hourly employees provide benefits
      based on fixed rates for each year of service. The German plans are not funded
      but the company maintains book reserves, and annual additions to the reserves
      are generally tax deductible. With the exception of the German plans, our policy
      is to fund the plans on a current basis to the extent deductible under existing
      tax laws and regulations and in amounts sufficient to satisfy statutory funding
      requirements. We also have defined benefit pension obligations in France and
      Austria, the assets and liabilities of which are insignificant.

In
      June 2006 the company’s U.S. defined benefit plans for salaried employees
      were amended to provide more flexibility for future pension benefits by allowing
      portability and changing the benefit to a career average pay scheme that grows
      by a prescribed amount annually. The annual accounting expense under the amended
      plans will be lower and more predictable. The

amendments,
      which were effective January 1, 2007, reduced 2006 pension expense by
      approximately $7 million.

      Employment Benefit Obligations

(continued)

Effective
      with its year-end reporting, Ball adopted SFAS No. 158, “Employers’
      Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Plans,
      an
      Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),” which
      requires the recognition of the funded status of each defined benefit pension
      plan and other postretirement benefit plans on the consolidated balance sheet.
      Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is
      recognized as a liability. The initial impact of the standard, due to
      unrecognized prior service costs or credits and net actuarial gains or losses,
      as well as subsequent changes in the funded status, is recognized as a component
      of accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in shareholders’ equity.
      Additional minimum pension liabilities (AML) and related intangible assets
      are
      also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard. SFAS No. 158 does
      not permit retrospective application to prior periods. The following table
      summarizes the effect of required changes in the AML on Balls defined benefit
      pension plans as of December 31, 2006, prior to the adoption of
      SFAS No. 158, as well as the impact of the initial adoption of the
      standard:

Current
      financial accounting standards require that the discount rates used to calculate
      the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit
      obligations reflect the time value of money as of the measurement date of
      the benefit obligation and reflect the rates of return currently available
      on
      high quality fixed income securities whose cash flows (via coupons and
      maturities) match the timing and amount of future benefit payments of the plan.
      In addition, changes in the discount rate assumption should reflect changes
      in
      the general level of interest rates.

In
      selecting the U.S. discount rate for December 31, 2006, several benchmarks
      were considered to provide guidance. These benchmarks included Moody’s
      long-term corporate bond yield for Aa bonds and the Citigroup Pension
      Liability Index. In addition, the expected cash flows from the plans were
      modeled relative to the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and matched to cash
      flows from a portfolio of bonds rated Aa or better. In Canada the markets
      for locally denominated high-quality, longer term corporate bonds are relatively
      thin. As a result, the approach taken in Canada was to use yield curve spot
      rates to discount the respective benefit cash flows and to compute the
      underlying constant bond yield equivalent.

The
      Canadian discount rate at December 31, 2006, was selected based on a review
      of the expected benefit payments for each of the Canadian defined benefit plans
      over the next 60 years and then discounting the resulting cash flows to the
      measurement date using the AA corporate bond spot rates to determine the
      equivalent level discount rate. In the United Kingdom and Germany, the company
      and its actuarial consultants considered the applicable iBoxx 15+ year AA
      corporate bond yields for the respective markets and determined a rate
      consistent with those expectations.

In all
      countries, the discount rates selected for December 31, 2006, were based on
      the range of values obtained from cash flow specific methods, together with
      the changes in the general level of interest rates reflected by the
      benchmarks.

The
      assumption related to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
      reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide
      for the benefits over the life of the plans. The assumption was based upon
      Ball’s pension plan asset allocations, investment strategies and the views of
      investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Some reliance was
      placed on historical asset returns of our plans. An asset-return generation
      model was used to project future asset returns using simulation and asset class
      correlation. The analysis included expected future risk premiums,
      forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds
      and the price earnings ratios of major stock market indexes, expected inflation
      and real risk-free interest rate assumptions and the fund’s expected asset
      allocation.

The
      expected long-term rates of return on assets were calculated by applying the
      expected rate of return to a market related value of plan assets at the
      beginning of the year, adjusted for the weighted average expected contributions
      and benefit payments. For the North American plans, the market related value
      of
      plan assets used to calculate expected return was $811 million for 2006,
      $662.4 million for 2005 and $604.4 million for 2004.

Included
      in other comprehensive earnings, net of related tax effect, were a decrease
      in
      the minimum liability of $8 million in 2006 and increases of
      $43.6 million and $33.2 million in 2005 and 2004,
      respectively.

For
      pension plans, accumulated gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent
      corridor and the prior service cost are amortized over the average remaining
      service period of active participants.

Defined
      Benefit Pension Plan Assets

Investment
      policies and strategies for the plan assets in the U.S., Canada and the United
      Kingdom are established by pension investment committees and include the
      following common themes: (1) to provide for long-term growth of principal income
      without undue exposure to risk; (2) to minimize contributions to the plans;
      (3)
      to minimize and stabilize pension expense; and (4) to achieve a rate of return
      which is above the market average for each asset class over the long term.
      The
      pension investment committees are required to regularly, but no less frequently
      than once annually, review asset mix and asset performance, as well as the
      performance of the investment managers. Based on their reviews, which are
      generally conducted quarterly, investment policies and strategies are revised
      as
      appropriate.

Target
      asset allocations in the U.S. and Canada are set using a minimum and maximum
      range for each asset category as a percent of the total funds market value.
      Assets contributed to the United Kingdom plans are invested using established
      percentages. Following are the target asset allocations established as of

Contributions
      to the company’s defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded

      are expected to be $62.6 million, $65.1 million, $68.9 million,
      $73.9 million and $75.1 million for the years ending December 31, 2007
      through 2011, respectively, and a total of $436.7 million for the years
      2012 through 2016. Payments to participants in the unfunded German plans are
      expected to be $24.6 million, $25.1 million, $25.5 million,
      $25.9 million and $26.1 million in the years 2007 through 2011,
      respectively, and a total of $136.6 million thereafter.

Other
      Postemployment Benefits

The
      company sponsors defined benefit and defined contribution postretirement health
      care and life insurance plans for substantially all U.S. and Canadian employees.
      Employees may also qualify for long-term disability, medical and life insurance
      continuation and other postemployment benefits upon termination of active
      employment prior to retirement. All of the Ball-sponsored postretirement health
      care and life insurance plans are unfunded and, with the exception of life
      insurance benefits, are self-insured.

In
      Canada, the company provides supplemental medical and other benefits in
      conjunction with Canadian provincial health care plans. Most U.S. salaried
      employees who retired prior to 1993 are covered by noncontributory defined
      benefit medical plans with capped lifetime benefits. Ball provides a fixed
      subsidy toward each retiree’s future purchase of medical insurance for U.S.
      salaried and substantially all nonunion hourly employees retiring after January
      1, 1993. Life insurance benefits are noncontributory. Ball has no commitments
      to
      increase benefits provided by any of the postemployment benefit
      plans.

For
        Ball’s U.S. and Canadian postretirement benefit plans, the adoption of
        SFAS No. 158 resulted in a $16.3 million increase in employee
        benefit obligations, a $6.2 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities

and
        a
        $10.1 million reduction in shareholders’ equity (reported within
        accumulated other comprehensive loss).

The
      estimated net loss and prior service cost for the other postretirement plans
      that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net
      periodic benefit cost during 2007 are $0.2 million and $1.7 million,
      respectively.

The
      assumptions used for the determination of benefit obligations and net periodic
      benefit cost were the same as used for the U.S. and Canadian defined benefit
      pension plans. For other postretirement benefits, accumulated gains and losses,
      the prior service cost and the transition asset are amortized over the average
      remaining service period of active participants.

For
      the
      U.S. health care plans at December 31, 2006, a 9 percent health care
      cost trend rate was used for pre-65 and post-65 benefits, and trend rates were
      assumed to decrease to 5 percent in 2011 and remain at that level
      thereafter. For the Canadian plans, a 9.5 percent health care cost trend
      rate was used, which was assumed to decrease to 5 percent by 2016 and
      remain at that level in subsequent years.

Health
      care cost trend rates can have an effect on the amounts reported for the health
      care plan. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend
      rates
      would increase or decrease the total of service and interest cost by
      $0.6 million to $0.7 million and the postretirement benefit obligation
      by approximately $7.6 million to $9 million.

Other
      Benefit Plans

Through
      December 31, 2006, the company matched employee contributions to the 401(k)
      plan with shares of Ball common stock, up to 50 percent of up to
      6 percent of a participant’s annual salary. The expense associated with the
      company match amounted to $16.1 million, $14.3 million and
      $13 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Effective
      January 1, 2007, the company matches U.S. salaried employee contributions
      with shares of Ball common stock, up to 100 percent of the first
      3 percent of a participant’s salary plus 50 percent of the next
      2 percent.

In
      addition, substantially all employees within the company’s aerospace and
      technologies segment who participate in Ball’s 401(k) plan receive a
      performance-based matching cash contribution of up to 4 percent of base
      salary. The company recognized $6.3 million and $4.8 million of
      additional compensation expense related to this program for the years 2005
      and
      2004, respectively. There was no matching contribution for the year ended
      December 31, 2006.

In
      the company’s 401(k) plan matching contributions could not exceed $6,600 per
      employee and the limit on employee contributions was $15,000 per
      employee.

15.  
      Shareholders’ Equity

At
      December 31, 2006, the company had 550 million shares of common stock and
      15 million shares of preferred stock authorized, both without par value.
      Preferred stock includes 120,000 authorized but unissued shares designated
      as
      Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

Under
      the
      companys shareholder Rights Agreement dated July 26, 2006, one preferred
      stock purchase right (Right) is attached to each outstanding share of Ball
      Corporation common stock. Subject to adjustment, each Right entitles the
      registered holder to purchase from the company one one-thousandth of a share
      of
      Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $185
      per
      Right. If a person or group acquires 10 percent or more of the company’s
      outstanding common stock (or upon occurrence of certain other events), the
      Rights (other than those held by the acquiring person) become exercisable and
      generally entitle the holder to purchase shares of Ball Corporation common
      stock
      at a 50 percent discount. The Rights, which expire in 2016, are redeemable
      by
      the company at a redemption price of $0.001 per Right and trade with the common
      stock. Exercise of such Rights would cause substantial dilution to a person
      or
      group attempting to acquire control of the company without the approval of
      Ball’s board of directors. The Rights would not interfere with any merger or
      other business combinations approved by the board of directors.

The
      company reduced its share repurchase program in 2006 to $45.7 million, net
      of issuances, compared to $358.1 million net repurchases in 2005 and
      $50 million in 2004.

The
      net
      repurchases in 2006 did not include a forward contract entered into in
      December 2006 for the repurchase of 1,200,000 shares. The contract was
      settled on January 5, 2007, for $51.9 million in cash.

In
      connection with the employee stock purchase plan, the company contributes
      20 percent of up to $500 of each participating employee’s monthly payroll
      deduction toward the purchase of Ball Corporation common stock. Company
      contributions for this plan were $3.2 million in 2006, $3.2 million in
      2005 and $2.7 million in 2004.

      $2.9 million for 2006 and related tax benefits of $27.3 million and
      $20.8 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The change in the effective

Stock-Based
      Compensation Programs

Effective
      January 1, 2006, Ball adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share
      Based Payment,” which is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB
      Opinion No. 25. The new standard establishes accounting standards for
      transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods
      or
      services, including stock option and restricted stock grants. The major
      differences for Ball are that (1) expense is now recorded in the
      consolidated statements of earnings for the fair value of new stock option
      grants and nonvested portions of grants made prior to January 1, 2006, and
      (2) the company’s deposit share program (discussed below) is no longer a
      variable plan that is marked to current market value each month through
      earnings. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Ball has
      chosen to use the modified prospective transition method and the Black-Scholes
      valuation model.

The
      company has shareholder approved stock option plans under which options to
      purchase shares of Ball common stock have been granted to officers and key
      employees at the market value of the stock at the date of grant. Payment must
      be
      made at the time of exercise in cash or with shares of stock owned by the option
      holder, which are valued at fair market value on the date exercised. In general,
      options issued through December 31, 2006, are exercisable in four equal
      installments commencing one year from the date of grant and terminate 10 years
      from the date of grant.

The

      which have the same terms as the stock options. The weighted average remaining
      contractual term for all options outstanding at December 31, 2006, was
      6.1 years and the aggregate intrinsic value (difference in exercise price
      and closing price at that date) was $82.1 million. The weighted average
      remaining contractual term for options vested and exercisable at
      December 31, 2006, was 5.2 years and the aggregate intrinsic value was
      $77.5 million. The company received $12.4 million from options
      exercised during 2006. The intrinsic value associated with these exercises
      was
      $20.9 million and the associated tax benefit of $7.5 million was
      reported as other financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash
      flows. The total fair value of options vested during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was
      $4.8 million, $15.5 million and $8.8 million,
      respectively.

      Shareholders’ Equity

(continued)

These
      options cannot be traded in any equity market. However, based on the
      Black-Scholes option pricing model, adapted for use in valuing compensatory
      stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), options granted
      in
      2006, 2005 and 2004 have estimated weighted average fair values at the date
      of
      grant of $10.46 per share, $11.65 per share and $10.24 per share,
      respectively. The actual value an employee may realize will depend on the excess
      of the stock price over the exercise price on the date the option is exercised.
      Consequently, there is no assurance that the value realized by an employee
      will
      be at or near the value estimated. The fair values were estimated using the
      following weighted average assumptions:

For
      the
      year ended December 31, 2006, the company recognized in selling, general
      and administrative expenses pretax expense of $12.9 million
      ($7.8 million after tax) for share-based compensation arrangements. These
      amounts represented $0.08 per basic share and $0.07 per diluted share for the
      year. At December 31, 2006, there was $25.3 million of total
      unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested share-based compensation
      arrangements. This cost is expected to be recognized in earnings over a weighted
      average period of 2.7 years.

Through
      December 31, 2005, Ball accounted for its stock-based employee compensation
      programs using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25,
      “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” If we had elected to recognize
      compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123, pro forma net earnings
      and earnings per share would have been:

      Shareholders’ Equity

(continued)

On
        October 26, 2005, Ball’s board of directors approved the acceleration of
        the out-of-the-money, unvested nonqualified stock options granted in
        April 2005. The acceleration affected approximately 665,000 options
        granted to approximately 290 employees at an exercise price of $39.74. The
        accelerated vesting of these nonqualified options allowed the company to
        eliminate approximately $5 million of pretax expense (approximately
        $3 million after tax) combined for the years 2006 through
        2009.

In
        addition to stock options, the company issues to certain employees restricted
        shares and restricted stock units which vest over various periods but generally
        in equal installments over five years. Compensation cost is recorded based
        upon
        the fair value of the shares at the grant date. The adoption of
        SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) did not change the accounting for
        compensation cost for the company’s normal restricted share
        program.

To
      encourage certain senior management employees and outside directors to invest
      in
      Ball stock, Ball adopted a deposit share program in March 2001
      (subsequently amended and restated in April 2004) that matches purchased
      shares with restricted shares. In general, restrictions on the matching shares
      lapse at the end of four years from date of grant, or earlier if established
      share ownership guidelines are met, assuming the relevant qualifying purchased
      shares are not sold or transferred prior to that time. Through December 31,
      2005, under the principles of APB Opinion No. 25, this plan was
      accounted for as a variable plan where compensation expense was recorded based
      upon the current market price of the company’s common stock until restrictions
      lapsed. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) on
      January 1, 2006, grants under the plan are accounted for as equity awards
      and compensation expense is now recorded based upon the fair value of the shares
      at the grant date. The company recorded $6.7 million, $7.3 million and
      $17.5 million of expense in connection with this program in 2006, 2005 and
      2004, respectively.

      total
      of 896,200 options at an exercise price of $43.69 and 709,250 options
      at an exercise price of $39.74 were excluded for the years ended
      December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. There were no anti-dilutive

      Financial Instruments and Risk Management

Policies
      and Procedures

In
      the
      ordinary course of business, we employ established risk management policies
      and
      procedures to reduce our exposure to commodity price changes, changes in
      interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currencies and fluctuations in prices
      of
      the company’s common stock in regard to common share repurchases. Although the
      instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit, market and interest
      risk, the counterparties are expected to perform fully under the terms of the
      agreements.

Commodity
      Price Risk

We
      manage
      our North American commodity price risk in connection with market price
      fluctuations of aluminum primarily by entering into container sales contracts
      which include aluminum-based pricing terms that generally reflect price
      fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases.
      The
      terms include a fixed price, floating price or an upper limit to the aluminum
      component pricing. This matched pricing affects substantially all of our metal
      beverage packaging, Americas, net sales. We also, at times, use certain
      derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow and
      fair value hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass-through
      arrangement in the sales contract.

Plastic
      packaging, Americas, sales contracts include provisions to pass through resin
      cost changes. As a result, we believe we have minimal, if any, exposure related
      to changes in the cost of plastic resin. Most metal food and household products
      packaging, Americas, sales contracts either include provisions permitting us
      to
      pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur, or they incorporate
      annually negotiated steel costs. In 2006 and 2005, we were able to pass through
      to our customers the majority of steel cost increases.

In
      Europe
      and Asia, the company manages the aluminum and steel raw commodity price risks
      through annual and long-term contracts for the purchase of the materials, as
      well as for certain sales of containers, that reduce the company’s exposure to
      fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year. These purchase and
      sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass-through pricing
      arrangements. We also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges
      to
      manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures for those
      sales
      contracts where there is not a pass-through arrangement to minimize the
      company’s exposure to significant price changes.

The
      company had aluminum forward contracts hedging its aluminum exposure with
      notional amounts of $260.3 million and $406.1 million at
      December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash flow and fair value hedges
      related to forecasted transactions and firm commitments expire within the next
      four years.

Included
      in shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2006, within accumulated other
      comprehensive loss, is a net after-tax loss of $3.5 million associated with
      these contracts, of which a net loss of $7 million is expected to be
      recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during 2007. All of the
      loss on these derivative contracts will be offset by higher revenue from sales
      contracts. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006, included
      $29.7 million in prepaid expenses and $34.8 million in liabilities
      related to unrealized gains/losses on unsettled derivative contracts. The
      consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005, included
      $36.6 million in prepaid expenses and $72.9 million in liabilities for
      these gains/losses.

Interest
      Rate Risk

Our
      objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the
      impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our
      overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we use a variety of
      interest rate swaps, collars and options to manage our mix of floating and
      fixed-rate debt. Interest rate instruments held by the company at
      December 31, 2006, included pay-fixed interest rate swaps. Pay-fixed swaps
      effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments. Swap
      agreements expire at various times up to five years.

      Financial Instruments and Risk Management

(continued)

At
      December 31, 2006, the company had outstanding interest rate swap
      agreements in Europe with notional amounts of €135 million paying fixed
      rates. Approximately $4 million of net gain associated with these contracts
      is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2006,
      of which $0.8 million is expected to be recognized in the consolidated
      statement of earnings during 2007. Approximately $1.1 million of net gain
      related to the termination or deselection of hedges is included in accumulated
      other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2006. The amount recognized in
      2006 earnings related to terminated hedges was insignificant.

The
      fair
      value of all non-derivative financial instruments approximates their carrying
      amounts with the exception of long-term debt. Rates currently available to
      the
      company for loans with similar terms and maturities are used to estimate the
      fair value of long-term debt based on discounted cash flows. The fair value
      of
      derivatives generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay or
      receive upon termination of the contracts at December 31, 2006, taking into
      account any unrealized gains and losses on open contracts.

Foreign
      Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Our
      objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect
      foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency
      exchange rate changes through the use of cash flow hedges. In addition, we
      manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of foreign
      currency options. Our foreign currency translation risk results from the
      European euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Serbian dinar,
      Brazilian real, Argentine peso and Chinese renminbi. We face currency exposures
      in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars
      and, to a lesser extent, in other currencies. Sales contracts are negotiated
      with customers to reflect cost changes and, where there is not a foreign
      exchange pass-through arrangement, the company uses forward and option contracts
      to manage foreign currency exposures. Such contracts outstanding at December
      31,
      2006, expire within four years and there are no amounts included in accumulated
      other comprehensive loss related to these contracts.

      Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)

(continued)

Subsequent
        to the issuance of its financial statements for the year ended December 31,
        2005, the company determined that certain foreign currency exchange losses
        had
        been inadvertently deferred for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003. As a result,
        selling, general and administrative expenses were understated by
        $2.5 million, $2.3 million and $1 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
        respectively. Management has assessed the impact of these adjustments and
        does
        not believe these amounts are material, individually or in the aggregate,
        to any
        previously issued financial statements or to our full year results of operations
        for 2006. A cumulative $5.8 million pretax out-of-period adjustment was
        included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter
        of
        2006.

Other
        than the items discussed above, fluctuations in sales and earnings for the
        quarters in 2006 and 2005 reflected the number of days in each fiscal quarter,
        as well as the normal seasonality of our businesses.

The
        following table summarizes the effect on the company’s consolidated financial
        statements of the fourth quarter 2006 change in accounting for certain

          sales, amounted to $22.5 million, $24.6 million and $25.5 million
          for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
          respectively.

20.  
        Subsidiary Guarantees of Debt

As
        discussed in Note 12, the company’s notes payable and senior credit
        facilities are guaranteed on a full, unconditional and joint and several
        basis
        by certain of the company’s domestic wholly owned subsidiaries. Certain foreign
        denominated tranches of the senior credit facilities are similarly guaranteed
        by
        certain of the company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. The senior credit
        facilities are secured by: (1) a pledge of 100 percent of the stock owned
        by the company in its material direct and indirect majority-owned domestic
        subsidiaries and (2) a pledge of the company’s stock, owned directly or
        indirectly, of certain foreign subsidiaries, which equals 65 percent of the
        stock of each such foreign subsidiary.

The
        following is condensed, consolidating financial information for the company,
        segregating the guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries, as
        of
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, and for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
        and 2004. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified in order to conform
        to the current year presentation. Prior year amounts have also been
        retrospectively adjusted to reflect the company’s fourth quarter 2006 change in
        accounting for certain inventories from LIFO to FIFO (as discussed in
        Note 7). Additionally, certain intercompany amounts in the 2005 balance
        sheet have been revised, which were not considered by management to be material
        to the overall financial statement presentation. Separate financial statements
        for the guarantor subsidiaries and the non-guarantor subsidiaries are not
        presented because management has determined that such financial statements
        would
        not be material to investors.

21.  
      Contingencies

The
      company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course
      of
      business due, in part, to the competitive nature of the industries in which
      we
      participate, our operations in developing markets, changing commodity prices
      for
      the materials used in the manufacture of our products and changing capital
      markets. Where practicable, we attempt to reduce these risks and uncertainties
      through the establishment of risk management policies and procedures, including,
      at times, the use of certain derivative financial instruments.

From
      time
      to time, the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its business.
      Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated Ball
      as a
      potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the
      cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Our information at this time does
      not
      indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the
      liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the
      company.

Due
      to
      political and legal uncertainties in Germany, no nationwide system for returning
      beverage containers was in place at the time a mandatory deposit was imposed
      in
      January 2003, and nearly all retailers stopped carrying beverages in
      non-refillable containers. We responded to the resulting lower demand for
      beverage cans with several measures including reducing capacity and converting
      production lines from steel to aluminum to facilitate exports from Germany
      to
      other European countries. Since May 1, 2006, all retailers have been required
      to
      redeem all returned one-way containers as long as they sell such containers.
      Many retailers in Germany have begun the process of implementing a returnable
      system for one-way containers. The retailers and the filling and packaging
      industries have formed a committee to design a nationwide recollection system
      and several retailers have ordered and installed reverse vending machines in
      order to streamline the recollection system. One-way packaging sales by German
      retailers have increased significantly since May 1, 2006 (albeit off a low
      base). We believe it will take some time to recover from the significant
      decrease experienced beginning in 2003. Usage will increase as one-way
      collection systems are more fully developed and consumers become educated
      regarding the systems and the reintroduction of one-way packaging.

As
      described in Note 13, the IRS has proposed to disallow Ball’s deductions of
      interest expense for the tax years 2000 through 2004 incurred on loans under
      a
      company-owned life insurance plan that was established in 1986. Ball has
      disputed the IRS’s claims and the company believes the interest deductions will
      be sustained as filed.

22.  
      Indemnifications and Guarantees

During
      the normal course of business, the company or the appropriate consolidated
      direct or indirect subsidiaries have made certain indemnities, commitments
      and
      guarantees under which the specified entity may be required to make payments
      in
      relation to certain transactions. These indemnities, commitments and guarantees
      include indemnities to the customers of the subsidiaries in connection with
      the
      sales of their packaging and aerospace products and services; guarantees to
      suppliers of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the company guaranteeing the
      performance of the respective entity under a purchase agreement; indemnities
      for
      liabilities associated with the infringement of third party patents, trademarks
      or copyrights under various types of agreements; indemnities to various lessors
      in connection with facility, equipment, furniture and other personal property
      leases for certain claims arising from such leases; indemnities pursuant to
      agreements relating to certain joint ventures; indemnities in connection with
      the sale of businesses or substantially all of the assets and specified
      liabilities of businesses; and indemnities to directors, officers and employees
      of the company to the extent permitted under the laws of the State of Indiana
      and the United States of America. The duration of these indemnities, commitments
      and guarantees varies, and in certain cases, is indefinite. In addition, the
      majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for
      any
      limitation on the maximum potential future payments the company could be
      obligated to make. As such, the company is unable to reasonably estimate its
      potential exposure under these items. The company has not recorded any liability
      for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees in the accompanying
      consolidated balance sheets. The company does, however, accrue for payments
      under promissory notes and other evidences of incurred indebtedness and for
      losses for any known contingent liability, including those that may arise from
      indemnifications, commitments and guarantees, when future payment is both
      reasonably determinable and probable. Finally, the company carries specific
      and
      general liability insurance policies and has obtained indemnities, commitments
      and guarantees from third party purchasers, sellers and other contracting
      parties, which the company believes would, in many circumstances, provide
      recourse to any claims arising from these indemnifications, commitments and
      guarantees.

The
      company’s senior notes and senior credit facilities are guaranteed on a full,
      unconditional and joint and several basis by certain of the company’s wholly
      owned domestic subsidiaries. Certain foreign denominated tranches of the senior
      credit facilities are similarly guaranteed by certain of the company’s wholly
      owned foreign subsidiaries. These guarantees are required in support of the
      notes and credit facilities referred to above, are co-terminous with the terms
      of the respective note indentures and credit agreement and would require
      performance upon certain events of default referred to in the respective
      guarantees. The maximum potential amounts which could be required to be paid
      under the guarantees are essentially equal to the then outstanding principal
      and
      interest under the respective notes and credit agreement, or under the
      applicable tranche. The company is not in default under the above notes or
      credit facilities.

Ball
      Capital Corp. II is a separate, wholly owned corporate entity created for the
      purchase of receivables from certain of the company’s wholly owned subsidiaries.
      Ball Capital Corp. II’s assets will be available first and foremost to satisfy
      the claims of its creditors. The company has provided an undertaking to Ball
      Capital Corp. II in support of the sale of receivables to a commercial lender
      or
      lenders which would require performance upon certain events of default referred
      to in the undertaking. The maximum potential amount which could be paid is
      equal
      to the outstanding amounts due under the accounts receivable financing (see
      Note 6). The company, the appropriate subsidiaries and Ball Capital Corp.
      II are not in default under the above credit arrangement.

From
      time
      to time, the company is subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of
      business. In the opinion of management, no such matter, individually or in
      the
      aggregate, exists which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the
      company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
      flows.

Controls
      and Procedures

Evaluation
      of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We
      have
      established disclosure controls and procedures to seek to ensure that material
      information relating to the company, including its consolidated subsidiaries,
      is
      made known to the officers who certify the company’s financial reports and to
      other members of senior management and the board of directors. Based on their
      evaluation as of December 31, 2006, the chief executive officer and chief
      financial officer of the company have concluded that the company’s disclosure
      controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
      the
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective.

Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our
      management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
      control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
      Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our
      management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
      we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
      financial reporting based on the framework in “Internal Control - Integrated
      Framework”

issued
      by
      the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based
      on
      our evaluation under the framework in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework,”
      our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
      was
      effective as of December 31, 2006.

As
      permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission guidance, management has
      excluded the operations related to the U.S. Can and Alcan businesses (acquired
      in March 2006) from its assessment of internal control over financial
      reporting as of December 31, 2006. The U.S. Can and Alcan operations
      combined represented approximately 8 percent of Ball’s 2006 consolidated
      net sales and 17 percent of Ball’s consolidated total assets at
      December 31, 2006. The controls for these acquired operations are required
      to be evaluated and tested by the end of 2007.

Our
      management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
      financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, has been audited by
      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
      as
      stated in their report which is included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and
      Supplementary Data.”

Changes
      in Internal Control

There
      were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the
      year
      ended December 31, 2006, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
      likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
      The
      company acquired certain operations of U.S. Can Corporation (U.S. Can) on March
      27, 2006, and certain assets of Alcan Packaging (Alcan) on March 28, 2006.
      (Additional details are available in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
      statements within Item 8 of this report.) The company has begun integrating
      the acquired U.S. Can and Alcan operations within its system of internal
      controls over financial reporting. Pursuant to rules promulgated under
      Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the controls for these
      acquired operations are required to be evaluated and tested by the end of
      2007.
