PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

The principal business of Universal Health Services, Inc.
(together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) is owning and operating through its subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers. At December 31, 2002, the Company
operated 34 acute care hospitals and 38 behavioral health centers located in Arkansas, California, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada,
New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington and France. The Company, as part of its ambulatory treatment centers division, owns outright, or in partnership with physicians, and operates or
manages 24 surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 12 states and Puerto Rico.

Services provided by the Company’s hospitals include general surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services
and behavioral health services. The Company provides capital resources as well as a variety of management services to its facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician
recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.

The Company selectively seeks opportunities to expand its base of operations by acquiring, constructing or leasing additional hospital facilities. Such expansion may provide the Company with access to
new markets and new health care delivery capabilities. The Company also seeks to increase the operating revenues and profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services, improvement of existing services, physician recruitment and
the application of financial and operational controls. Pressures to contain health care costs and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or
outpatient care wherever possible. The Company is responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services. In addition, in response to cost containment pressures, the Company intends to implement programs designed to improve
financial performance and efficiency while continuing to provide quality care, including more efficient use of professional and paraprofessional staff, monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage, improving patient management and
reporting procedures and implementing more efficient billing and collection procedures. The Company also continues to examine its facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities which it believes do not have the potential to contribute to
the Company’s growth or operating strategy.

The Company is involved in continual development activities. Applications to state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals are currently on file in states which require certificates of need. Although the
Company expects that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to the Company’s operations, no assurances can be made for ultimate success by the Company in these efforts.

Recent and Proposed Acquisitions and Development Activities

During and subsequent to 2002, the Company
proceeded with its development of new facilities and consummated a number of acquisitions.

In January, 2003, the Company acquired the assets and operations of: (i) a 108-bed behavioral health system in Anchorage, Alaska, and; (ii) two hospitals located in France that were purchased by an
operating company which is 80% owned by the Company.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company acquired the assets and operations of: (i) a 150-bed acute care facility located in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, and; (ii) a 117-bed acute care facility located in Lancaster, California. Included in
other assets at December 31, 2001 were $70 million of deposits related to the acquisition of these two facilities. Also during 2002, the Company acquired a majority ownership interest in the assets and operations of a surgery center located in San
Turce, Puerto Rico.



Bed Utilization and
Occupancy Rates

The following table shows
the historical bed utilization and occupancy rates for the hospitals operated by the Company for the years indicated. Accordingly, information related to hospitals acquired during the five year period has been included from the respective dates of
acquisition, and information related to hospitals divested during the five year period has been included up to the respective dates of divestiture.

Note:  Included

in the Acute Care Hospitals beginning in 2001 is the data for the nine hospitals located in France owned by an operating company in which the Company purchased an
80% ownership interest during 2001.

(1)

“Average Available Beds” is the number of beds which are actually in service at any given time for immediate patient use with the necessary equipment and
staff available for patient care. A hospital may have appropriate licenses for more beds than are in service for a number of reasons, including lack of demand, incomplete construction, and anticipation of future needs.

(2)

“Patient Days” is the aggregate sum for all patients of the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient.

(3)

“Occupancy Rate” is calculated by dividing average patient days (total patient days divided by the total number of days in the period) by the number of
average beds, either available or licensed.

The number of patient days of a hospital is affected by a number of factors, including the number of physicians using the hospital, changes in the number of beds, the composition and size of the population of the community in which
the hospital is located, general and local economic conditions, variations in local medical and surgical practices and the degree of outpatient use of the hospital services. Current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been
significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors. A continuation of such industry trends could have a material adverse impact upon the Company’s future operating performance. The Company has experienced growth
in outpatient utilization over the past several years. The Company is unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on the Company’s future revenues because it is dependent upon developments in medical technologies and physician
practice patterns, both of which are outside of the Company’s control. The Company is also unable to predict the extent to which other industry trends will continue or accelerate.



Sources of Revenue

The Company receives payment for services
rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients. All of the Company’s acute care hospitals
and most of the Company’s behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities. The requirements for certification are subject to change, and, in order to remain
qualified for such programs, it may be necessary for the Company to make changes from time to time in its facilities, equipment, personnel and services. The costs for recertification are not material as many of the requirements for recertification
are integrated with the Company’s internal quality control processes. If a facility loses certification, it will be unable to receive payment for patients under the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Although the Company intends to continue in such
programs, there is no assurance that it will continue to qualify for participation.

The sources of the Company’s hospital revenues are charges related to the services provided by the hospitals and their staffs, such as radiology, operating rooms, pharmacy, physiotherapy and
laboratory procedures, and basic charges for the hospital room and related services such as general nursing care, meals, maintenance and housekeeping. Hospital revenues depend upon the occupancy for inpatient routine services, the extent to which
ancillary services and therapy programs are ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services. Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine
services vary depending on the type of bed occupied (

e.g.,

medical/surgical, intensive care or psychiatric) and the geographic location of the hospital.

McAllen Medical Center located in McAllen, Texas and Edinburg Regional Medical Center located in Edinburg, Texas operate within the same
market. On a combined basis, these two facilities contributed 11% in both 2002 and 2001, and 12% in 2000 of the Company’s consolidated net revenues and 17% in both 2002 and 2001, and 21% in 2000 of the Company’s consolidated earnings
before depreciation, amortization, interest, income taxes and nonrecurring charges (after deducting an allocation of corporate overhead)(“EBITDA”). The Company has a majority ownership interest in three acute care hospitals in the Las
Vegas, Nevada market. These three hospitals, Valley Hospital Medical Center, Summerlin Hospital Medical Center and Desert Springs Hospital, on a combined basis, contributed 15% in 2002, 16% in 2001 and 18% in 2000 of the Company’s consolidated
net revenues and 12% in 2002, 13% in 2001 and 14% in 2000 of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA.

The following table shows approximate percentages of net patient revenue derived by the Company’s hospitals owned as of December 31,
2002 since their respective dates of acquisition by the Company from third party sources, including the additional Medicaid reimbursements received at five of the Company’s acute care facilities located in Texas and one in South Carolina
totaling $33.0 million in 2002, $32.6 million in 2001, $28.9 million in 2000, $37.0 million in 1999, and $36.5 million in 1998, and from all other sources during the five years ended December 31, 2001.



Regulation and Other
Factors

A significant portion of the
Company’s revenue is derived from federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid (excluding managed Medicare and Medicaid programs), which accounted for 42%, 42% and 44% of the Company’s net patient revenues during
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Under the statutory framework of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, many of the Company’s operations are subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion which may affect payments made under
either or both of such programs. In addition, reimbursement is generally subject to audit and review by third party payors. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustment that might result therefrom.

The federal government makes payments to participating
hospitals under the Medicare program based on various formulas. The Company’s general acute care hospitals are subject to a prospective payment system (“PPS”). For inpatient services, PPS pays hospitals a predetermined amount per
diagnostic related group (“DRG”), for which payment amounts are adjusted to account for geographic wage differences. Beginning August 1, 2000 under an outpatient prospective payment system (“OPPS”) mandated by Congress in the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (“BBA-97”), both general acute and behavioral health hospitals are paid for outpatient services included in the OPPS according to ambulatory procedure codes (“APC”), which group together services that
are comparable both clinically and with respect to the use of resources. The payment for each item or service is determined by the APC to which it is assigned. The APC payment rates are calculated on a national basis and adjusted to account for
certain geographic wage differences. The Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (“BBRA of 1999”) included “transitional corridor payments” through fiscal year 2003, which provide some financial relief
for any hospital that generally incurs a reduction to its Medicare outpatient reimbursement under the new OPPS.

Behavioral health facilities, which are generally excluded from the inpatient services PPS are reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis by
the Medicare program, but are generally subject to a per discharge ceiling, calculated based on an annual allowable rate of increase over the hospital’s base year amount under the Medicare law and regulations. Capital-related costs are exempt
from this limitation. In the BBA-97, Congress significantly revised the Medicare payment provisions for PPS-excluded hospitals, including certain behavioral health services facilities. Effective for Medicare cost reporting periods beginning on or
after October 1, 1997, different caps are applied to certain behavioral health services hospitals’ target amounts depending upon whether a hospital was excluded from PPS before or after that date, with higher caps for hospitals excluded before
that date. Congress also revised the rate-of-increase percentages for PPS-excluded hospitals and eliminated the new provider PPS-exemption for behavioral health hospitals. In addition, the Health Care Financing Administration, now known as the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), has implemented requirements applicable to behavioral health services hospitals that share a facility or campus with another hospital. The BBRA of 1999 requires that CMS develop a per
diem PPS for inpatient services furnished by certain behavioral health hospitals under the Medicare program, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002. This PPS must include an adequate patient classification system
that reflects the differences in patient resource use and costs among these hospitals and must maintain budget neutrality. However implementation of this PPS for inpatient services furnished by certain behavioral health hospitals has been delayed
until the first quarter of 2004. Although Management of the Company believes the implementation of inpatient PPS may have a favorable effect on the Company’s future results of operations, Management can not predict the ultimate effect of
behavioral health inpatient PPS on the Company’s future operating results until the provisions are finalized.

In addition to the trends described above that continue to have an impact on the Company’s operating results, there are a number of
other more general factors affecting the Company’s business. BBA-97 called for the government to trim the growth of federal spending on Medicare by $115 billion and on Medicaid by $13 billion over the ensuing 5 years. This enacted legislation
also called for reductions in the future rate of increases to payments made to hospitals and reduced the amount of payments for outpatient services, bad debt expense and capital costs. Some of these reductions were temporarily reversed with the
passage of the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (“BIPA”) which, among other things, increased Medicare and Medicaid payments to healthcare providers by $35 billion over the ensuing 5 years with
approximately $12 billion of this amount targeted for hospitals and $11 billion for managed care payors. However, many of the payment reductions reversed by Congress in BIPA are expiring. In addition, without further Congressional action, in fiscal
year 2003 hospitals will receive less than a full market basket inflation



adjustment for services paid under the inpatient PPS (inpatient PPS update of the market basket minus 0.55 percentage points is estimated to
equal 2.95% in fiscal year 2003), although CMS estimates that for the same time period, Medicare payment rates under OPPS will increase, for each service, by an average of 3.7 percent. In February, 2003, the federal fiscal year 2003 omnibus spending
federal legislation was signed into law. This legislation includes approximately $800 million in increased spending for hospitals. More specifically, $300 million of this amount is targeted for rural and certain urban hospitals effective for the
period of April, 2003 through September, 2003. Certain of the Company’s hospitals are eligible for and are expected to receive the increased Medicare reimbursement resulting from this legislation, however, the impact is not expected to have a
material effect on the Company’s future results of operations.

Certain Medicare inpatient hospital cases with extraordinarily high costs in relation to other cases within a given DRG may receive an additional payment from Medicare (“Outlier Payments”). In general, to qualify
for the additional Outlier Payments, the gross charges associated with an individual patient’s case must exceed the applicable standard DRG payment plus a threshold established annually by CMS. In the federal 2003 fiscal year, the unadjusted
Outlier Payment threshold increased to $33,560 from $21,025. Outlier Payments are currently subject to multiple factors including but not limited to: (i) the hospital’s estimated operating costs based on its historical ratio of costs to gross
charges; (ii) the patient’s case acuity; (iii) the CMS established threshold; and; (iv) the hospital’s geographic location. However, in February, 2003, CMS issued a proposed rule that would change the outlier formula in an effort to
promote more accurate spending for outlier payments to hospitals. Management of the Company ultimately believes the increase in the Outlier Payments threshold and potential change in the Outlier Payment methodology will result in a decrease in the
overall Outlier Payments expected to be received by the Company during the 2003 federal fiscal year. This decrease is expected to substantially offset the increase in Medicare payments resulting from the market basket inflation adjustment as
mentioned above. The Company’s total Outlier Payments in 2002 were less than 1% of its consolidated net revenues and Management expects that Outlier Payments in 2003 will amount to less than 0.5% of the Company’s consolidated net revenues.

Within certain limits, a hospital can manage its
costs, and to the extent this is done effectively, a hospital may benefit from the DRG system. However, many hospital operating costs are incurred in order to satisfy licensing laws, standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations (“JCAHO”) and quality of care concerns. In addition, hospital costs are affected by the level of patient acuity, occupancy rates and local physician practice patterns, including length of stay and number and type of tests and
procedures ordered. A hospital’s ability to control or influence these factors which affect costs is, in many cases, limited.

In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, the Company receives a large portion of its revenues either directly
from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid with a large concentration of the Company’s Medicaid revenues received from Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. The Company can provide no assurance that reductions to
Medicaid revenues in any state in which it operates, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future results of operations. Furthermore, the Company can provide no assurances that
future reductions to federal and/or state budgets that contain certain further reductions or decreases in the rate of increase of Medicare and Medicaid spending, will not adversely affect the Company’s future operations.

In 1991, the Texas legislature authorized the LoneSTAR Health
Initiative, a pilot program in two areas of the state, to establish for Medicaid beneficiaries a healthcare delivery system based on managed care principles. The program is now known as the STAR program, which is short for State of Texas Access
Reform. Since 1995, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, with the help of other Texas agencies such as the Texas Department of Health, has rolled out STAR Medicaid managed care pilot programs in several geographic areas of the state.
Under the STAR program, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission either contracts with health maintenance organizations in each area to arrange for covered services to Medicaid beneficiaries, or contracts directly with healthcare providers and
oversees the furnishing of care in the role of a case manager. Two carve-out pilot programs are the STAR+PLUS program, which provides long-term care to elderly and



disabled Medicaid beneficiaries in the Harris County service area, and the NorthSTAR program, which furnishes behavioral health services to
Medicaid beneficiaries in the Dallas County service area. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission is currently seeking a waiver to extend a limited Medicaid benefits package to low income persons with serious mental illness. The waiver is
limited to individuals residing in Harris County or the NorthSTAR service areas. Effective in the fall of 1999, however, the Texas legislature imposed a moratorium on the implementation of additional pilot programs until the 2001 legislative
session. While Texas Senate Bill 1, effective September 1, 2001, directed the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to implement Medicaid cost containment measures including a statewide rollout of the primary care case management program in
non-STAR areas, expansion of this program has been delayed in response to concerns from hospitals and physicians. Although no legislation has passed yet, such actions could have a material unfavorable impact on the reimbursement the Texas hospitals
receive during the period of September, 2003 to September, 2005.

Upon meeting certain conditions, and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas’ and South Carolina’s low income patients, five of the Company’s facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South
Carolina became eligible and received additional reimbursement from each state’s disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) fund. In order to receive DSH funds, the facility must qualify to receive such payments. To qualify for DSH funds
in Texas, the facility must have either a disproportionate total number of inpatient days for Medicaid patients, a disproportionate percentage of all inpatient days that are for Medicaid patients, or a disproportionate percentage of all inpatient
days that are for low-income patients. Included in the Company’s financial results was an aggregate of $33.0 million in 2002, $32.6 million in 2001 and $28.9 million in 2000, related to DSH programs. The Office of Inspector General recently
published a report indicating that Texas Medicaid may have overpaid Texas hospitals for DSH payments. Although it is not yet clear how this issue will be resolved, it may have an adverse effect on the Company’s hospitals located in Texas that
have significant Medicaid populations. Both states have renewed their programs for the 2003 fiscal years, however, failure to renew these programs beyond their scheduled termination date (June 30, 2003 for South Carolina and August 31, 2003 for
Texas), failure to qualify for DSH funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, (including reductions related to the potential Texas Medicaid overpayments mentioned above) could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
future results of operations.

The healthcare
industry is subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations which include, among other things, participation requirements of federal and state health care programs, various licensure and accreditation requirements, reimbursement rules for
patient services, False Claims Act provisions, patient privacy rules and Medicare and Medicaid anti-fraud and abuse provisions. Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in federal and
state healthcare programs, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from government for previously billed patient services. While management of the Company believes its policies, procedures and practices comply with
applicable laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that the Company will not be subjected to governmental inquiries or actions or that governmental authorities may not find the Company to be in violation of a law or regulation as a result of
an inquiry or action.

Pressures to control
health care costs and a shift away from traditional Medicare to Medicare managed care plans have resulted in an increase in the number of patients whose health care coverage is provided under managed care plans. Approximately 39% in 2002, 37% in
2001 and 35% in 2000, of the Company’s net patient revenues were generated from managed care companies, which includes health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs. In general,
the Company expects the percentage of its business from managed care programs to continue to grow. The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of the Company’s facilities
vary among the markets in which the Company operates. Typically, the Company receives lower payments per patient from managed care payors than it does from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past two years, the Company secured price
increases from many of its commercial payors including managed care companies.

The federal physician self-referral and payment prohibitions (codified in 42 U.S.C. Section 1395nn, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act) generally forbid, absent qualifying for one of the
exceptions, a physician



from making referrals for the furnishing of any “designated health services,” for which payment may be made under the Medicare or
Medicaid programs, to any entity with which the physician (or an immediate family member) has a “financial relationship.” The legislation was effective January 1, 1992 for clinical laboratory services (“Stark I”) and January 1,
1995 for ten other designated health services (“Stark II”). A “financial relationship” under Stark I and II includes any direct or indirect “compensation arrangement” with an entity for payment of any remuneration, and
any direct or indirect “ownership or investment interest” in the entity. The legislation contains certain exceptions including, for example, where the referring physician has an ownership interest in a hospital as a whole or where the
physician is an employee of an entity to which he or she refers. The Stark I and II self-referral and payment prohibitions include specific reporting requirements providing that each entity providing covered items or services must provide certain
information concerning its ownership, investment, and compensation arrangements. In August 1995, CMS published a final rule regarding physician self-referrals for clinical lab services (Stark I). On January 4, 2001, CMS published a portion of the
final rules regarding physician self referrals for the ten other designated health services (Stark II). The remaining portions of the final rule for Stark II are still forthcoming. Penalties for violating Stark I and Stark II include denial of
payment for any services rendered by an entity in violation of the prohibitions, civil money penalties of up to $15,000 for each offense, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

The federal anti-kickback statute (codified in 42 U.S.C.
Section 1320a-7b(b)) prohibits individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration to other individuals and entities (directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind):

1.

in return for referring an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made under a
federal or state health care program; or

2.

in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, service or item for which payment
may be made under a federal or state health care program.

Starting in 1991, the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) issued regulations which provide for “safe harbors” from the federal anti-kickback statute; if an arrangement
or transaction meets each of the standards established for a particular safe harbor, the arrangement will not be subject to challenge by the Inspector General. If an arrangement does not meet the safe harbor criteria, it will be subject to scrutiny
under its particular facts and circumstances to determine whether it violates the federal anti-kickback statute. Safe harbors include protection for certain limited investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, personal service/management
contracts, sales of a physician practice, referral services, warranties, employees, discounts and group purchasing arrangements, among others. The criminal sanctions for a conviction under the anti-kickback statute include imprisonment, fines, or
both. Civil sanctions include exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs.

Many states have also enacted similar illegal remuneration statutes that apply to healthcare services reimbursed by private insurance, not just those reimbursed by a federal or state health care
program. In many instances, the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes.

The Company does not anticipate that the Stark provisions, the anti-kickback statute or similar state law
provisions will have material adverse effects on our operations. However, in consideration of the current health care regulatory atmosphere, the Company cannot provide any assurance that federal or state authorities would not attempt to challenge
one or more of the Company’s business dealings in consideration of one of these federal or state provisions, or that if challenged that the authorities might not prevail.

As further discussed under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 — Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996” (“HIPAA”), we are subject to the



provisions of the HIPAA and have begun the process of implementing the necessary changes required pursuant to HIPAA (see Privacy and Security
Requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996).

Several states, including Florida and Nevada, have passed legislation which limits physician ownership in medical facilities providing imaging services, rehabilitation services, laboratory testing,
physical therapy and other services. This legislation is not expected to significantly affect our operations. Many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and fee-splitting with physicians. We do not make
any such payments or have any such arrangements.

All hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local statutes and regulations and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care, equipment and cleanliness. Our
hospitals must comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal, state and local health agencies, as well as the requirements of municipal building codes, health codes and local fire departments. In granting and
renewing licenses, a department of health considers, among other things, the physical buildings and equipment, the qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff, the quality of care and continuing compliance with the laws and
regulations relating to the operation of the facilities. State licensing of facilities is a prerequisite to certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics,
operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment. All our eligible hospitals have been accredited by JCAHO. JCAHO reviews each hospital’s accreditation once every three years. The review period for each
state’s licensing body varies, but generally ranges from once a year to once every three years.

The Social Security Act and regulations thereunder contain numerous provisions which affect the scope of Medicare coverage and the basis
for reimbursement of Medicare providers. Among other things, this law provides that in states which have executed an agreement with the Secretary of HHS, Medicare reimbursement may be denied with respect to depreciation, interest on borrowed funds
and other expenses in connection with capital expenditures which have not received prior approval by a designated state health planning agency. Additionally, many of the states in which our hospitals are located have enacted legislation requiring
certificates of need (“CON”) as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services. Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in the inability to
complete an acquisition or change of ownership, the imposition of civil or, in some cases, criminal sanctions, the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility’s license. We have not experienced and do
not expect to experience any material adverse effects from those requirements.

Health planning statutes and regulatory mechanisms are in place in many states in which we operate. These provisions govern the distribution of healthcare services, the number of new and replacement
hospital beds, administer required state CON laws, contain healthcare costs, and meet the priorities established therein. Significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states, including increases in the capital spending thresholds and
exemptions of various services from review requirements. We are unable to predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.

Federal regulations provide that admissions and utilization of facilities by Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to
insure efficient utilization of facilities and services. The law and regulations require Peer Review Organizations (“PROs”) to review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care
provided, the validity of DRG classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay. PROs may deny payment for services provided, assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to HHS that a provider that is in
substantial non-compliance with the standards of the PRO be excluded from participating in the Medicare program. We have contracted with PROs in each state where we do business as to the scope of such functions.

Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be
disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. In 1988, Congress passed the Medical Waste Tracking Act



(42 U.S.C. (S) 6992). Infectious waste generators, including hospitals, now face substantial penalties for improper arrangements regarding
disposal of medical waste, including civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day of noncompliance, criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day, imprisonment, and remedial costs. The comprehensive legislation establishes programs for medical waste
treatment and disposal in designated states. The legislation also provides for sweeping inspection authority in the Environmental Protection Agency, including monitoring and testing. We believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material
compliance with all state and federal laws.

Privacy and
Security Requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) was enacted in August, 1996 to assure health insurance portability, reduce healthcare fraud and abuse, guarantee security and
privacy of health information and enforce standards for health information. Provisions not yet finalized are required to be implemented two years after the effective date of the regulation. Organizations are subject to significant fines and
penalties if found not to be compliant with the provisions outlined in the regulations. Regulations related to HIPAA are expected to impact the Company and others in the healthcare industry by:

(i)

Establishing standardized code sets for financial and clinical electronic data interchange (“EDI”) transactions to enable more efficient flow of
information. Currently there is no common standard for the transfer of information between the constituents in healthcare and therefore providers have had to conform to each standard utilized by every party with which they interact. One of the goals
of HIPAA is to create one common national standard for EDI and once the HIPAA regulation takes effect, payors will be required to accept the national standard employed by providers. The final regulations establishing electronic data transmission
standards that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically were published in August 2000 and compliance with these regulations is required by October 2003, if a request for a one-year
extension for compliance was properly submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services. The Company was granted the one-year extension.

(ii)

Mandating the adoption of privacy standards to protect the confidentiality and privacy of health information. Prior to HIPAA there were no federally recognized
healthcare standards governing the privacy of health information that includes all the necessary components to protect the data integrity and confidentiality of a patient’s electronically maintained or transmitted personal health record. The
final modifications to the privacy regulations were published in August, 2002. Most covered entities must comply with the privacy regulations by April, 2003.

(iii)

Creating unique identifiers for the four constituents in healthcare: payors, providers, patients and employers. HIPAA mandates the need for the unique identifiers
for healthcare providers in an effort to ease the administrative challenge of maintaining and transmitting clinical data across disparate episodes of patient care.

(iv)

Requiring covered entities to establish procedures and mechanisms to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health
information. The rule requires covered entities to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect electronic protected health information that they receive, store, or transmit. Most covered entities will have until April,
2005 to comply with these security standards. The Company believes that it will be able to comply; however, the cost of compliance cannot yet be ascertained.

The Company is in the process of implementing the necessary changes required pursuant to HIPAA. The Company
expects that the implementation cost of the HIPAA related modifications will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.



Medical Staff and Employees

The Company’s hospitals are staffed by
licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals. With a few exceptions, physicians are not employees of the Company’s hospitals and members of the medical staffs of the Company’s hospitals also serve
on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by the Company and may terminate their affiliation with the Company’s hospitals at any time. Each of the Company’s hospitals is managed on a day-to-day basis by a managing director employed by
the Company. In addition, a Board of Governors, including members of the hospital’s medical staff, governs the medical, professional and ethical practices at each hospital. The Company’s facilities had approximately 32,000 employees on
December 31, 2002, of whom approximately 21,250 were employed full-time.

Approximately, 1,900 of the Company’s employees at six of its hospitals are unionized. At Valley Hospital, unionized employees belong to the Culinary Workers and Bartenders Union, the International Union of Operating
Engineers and the Service Employees International Union. In 2002, approximately 125 technicians at Valley Hospital decertified from the Service Employees International Union. Registered nurses at Auburn Regional Medical Center located in Washington,
are represented by the United Staff Nurses Union, the technical employees are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers, and the service employees are represented by the Service Employees International Union. At The George Washington
University Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the Service Employees International Union. Nurses and technicians at Desert Springs Hospital are represented by the Service Employees International Union. Registered Nurses, Licensed
Practical Nurses, certain technicians and therapists, pharmacy assistants, and some clerical employees at HRI Hospital in Boston are represented by the Service Employees International Union. Unionized employees at Hospital San Francisco in Puerto
Rico are represented by the Labor Union of Nurses and Health Employees. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are satisfactory.

Competition

In all geographical areas in which the Company operates, there are other hospitals which provide services comparable to those offered by
the Company’s hospitals, some of which are owned by governmental agencies and supported by tax revenues, and others of which are owned by nonprofit corporations and may be supported to a large extent by endowments and charitable contributions.
Such support is not available to the Company’s hospitals. Certain of the Company’s competitors have greater financial resources, are better equipped and offer a broader range of services than the Company. Outpatient treatment and
diagnostic facilities, outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical centers also impact the healthcare marketplace. In recent years, competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the United States
due to, among other things, regulatory and technological changes, increasing use of managed care payment systems, cost containment pressures, a shift toward outpatient treatment and an increasing supply of physicians. The Company’s strategies
are designed, and management believes that its facilities are positioned, to be competitive under these changing circumstances.

General and Professional Liability

Due to unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional and general liability insurance markets, the Company’s
subsidiaries have assumed a greater portion of the hospital professional and general liability risk as the cost of commercial professional and general liability insurance coverage has risen significantly. As a result, effective January 1, 2002, most
of the Company’s subsidiaries were self-insured for malpractice exposure up to $25 million per occurrence. The Company, on behalf of its subsidiaries, purchased an umbrella excess policy through a commercial insurance carrier for coverage in
excess of $25 million per occurrence with a $75 million aggregate limitation. Total insurance expense including professional and general liability, property, auto and workers’ compensation, was approximately $25 million higher in 2002 as
compared to 2001. Given these insurance market conditions, there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in claims asserted against the Company, will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s future results of operations.



For the period
from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2001, most of the Company’s subsidiaries were covered under professional and general liability insurance policies with PHICO, a Pennsylvania-based commercial insurance company. Certain subsidiaries,
including hospitals located in Washington, D.C, Puerto Rico and south Texas were covered under policies with various coverage limits up to $5 million per occurrence through December 31, 2001. The majority of the remaining subsidiaries were covered
under policies, which provided for a self-insured retention limit up to $1 million per occurrence, with an annual aggregate retention amount of approximately $4 million in 1998, $5 million in 1999, $7 million in 2000 and $11 million in 2001. These
subsidiaries maintain excess coverage up to $100 million with other major insurance carriers.

Early in the first quarter of 2002, PHICO was placed in liquidation by the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a $40 million
pre-tax charge to earnings to accrue for its estimated liability that resulted from this event. Management estimated this liability based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents,
estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of unasserted claims based on historical experience, and estimated recoveries from state guaranty funds.

When PHICO entered liquidation proceedings, each state’s
department of insurance was required to declare PHICO as insolvent or impaired. That designation effectively triggers coverage under the applicable state’s insurance guarantee association, which operates as replacement coverage, subject to the
terms, conditions and limits set forth in that particular state. Therefore, the Company is entitled to receive reimbursement from those state’s guarantee funds for which it meets the eligibility requirements. In addition, the Company may be
entitled to receive reimbursement from PHICO’s estate for a portion of the claims ultimately paid by the Company. Management expects that the remaining cash payments related to these claims will be made over the next seven years as the cases
are settled or adjudicated.

Included in other
assets as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, were estimates of approximately $37 million and $54 million, respectively, representing expected recoveries from various state guaranty funds. The reduction in estimated recoveries as of December 31, 2002 as
compared to December 31, 2001 is due to Management’s reassessment of its ultimate liability for general and professional liability claims relating to the period from 1998 through 2001, its estimate of related recoveries under state guaranty
funds, and payments received during 2002 from such state guaranty funds. While Management continues to monitor the factors used in making these estimates, the Company’s ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims and its
actual recoveries from state guaranty funds, could change materially from current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates. Therefore, there can be no assurance that changes in these estimates, if any, will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.

As of December 31, 2002, the total accrual for the Company’s professional and general liability claims, including all PHICO related
claims was $168.2 million ($131.2 million net of expected recoveries from state guaranty funds), of which $12.0 million is included in other current liabilities. As of December 31, 2001, the total reserve for the Company’s professional and
general liability claims was $158.1 million ($104.1 million net of expected recoveries from state guaranty funds), of which $26.0 million is included in other current liabilities.

Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust

At December 31, 2002, the Company held approximately 6.6% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health
Realty Income Trust (the “Trust”). The Company serves as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement. Pursuant to the terms of this advisory agreement, the Company conducts the Trust’s day to day affairs,
provides administrative services and presents investment opportunities. In addition, certain officers and directors of the Company are also officers and/or directors of the Trust. Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant
influence over the Trust, therefore the Company accounts for its investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting. The Company’s pre-tax share of income from



the Trust was $1.4 million during 2002, $1.3 million during 2001 and $1.2 million during 2000, and is included in net revenues in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income. The carrying value of this investment was $9.1 million and $9.0 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The
market value of this investment was $20.3 million at December 31, 2002 and $18.0 million at December 31, 2001.

As of December 31, 2002, the Company leased six hospital facilities from the Trust with terms expiring in 2004 through 2008. These leases
contain up to six 5-year renewal options. During 2002, the Company exercised the five-year renewal option on an acute care hospital leased from the Trust which was scheduled to expire in 2003. The renewal rate on this facility is based upon the five
year Treasury rate on March 29, 2003 plus a spread. Future minimum lease payments to the Trust are included in Note 7. Total rent expense under these operating leases was $17.2 million in 2002, $16.5 million in 2001 and $17.1 million in 2000. The
terms of the lease provide that in the event the Company discontinues operations at the leased facility for more than one year, the Company is obligated to offer a substitute property. If the Trust does not accept the substitute property offered,
the Company is obligated to purchase the leased facility back from the Trust at a price equal to the greater of its then fair market value or the original purchase price paid by the Trust. As of December 31, 2002, the aggregate fair market value of
the Company’s facilities leased from the Trust is not known, however, the aggregate original purchase price paid by the Trust for these properties was $112.5 million. The Company received an advisory fee from the Trust of $1.4 million in 2002
and $1.3 million in both 2001 and 2000 for investment and administrative services provided under a contractual agreement which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

During 2000, the Company sold the real property of a medical
office building to a limited liability company that is majority owned by the Trust for cash proceeds of approximately $10.5 million. Tenants in the multi-tenant building include subsidiaries of the Company as well as unrelated parties.

ITEM 3.

Legal
Proceedings

The Company is
subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by the Company’s hospitals, and is party to various other litigation. However, Management believes the ultimate resolution
of these pending proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company was contacted by the Philadelphia District Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission in February, 2003 requesting the voluntary provision of documents and related information and the
voluntary testimony of certain individuals arising out of the termination of Kirk E. Gorman as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. The SEC has advised the Company that the inquiry should not be construed as an indication by the SEC or its staff
that any violations of the law have occurred nor should it be considered a reflection upon any person, entity or security. The Company is fully cooperating with this inquiry.

Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Operations and Financial Condition

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors

The matters discussed in this report as well as the news releases issued from time to time by the Company include certain statements containing the words “believes”, “anticipates”, “intends”,
“expects” and words of similar import, which constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company or industry results to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among other things, the following: that the majority of the Company’s revenues are produced by a small number of its total facilities; possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of
reimbursement for the Company’s charges by government programs, including Medicare or Medicaid or other third party payors; industry capacity; demographic changes; existing laws and government regulations and changes in or failure to comply
with laws and governmental regulations; the ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms; liability and other claims asserted against the Company; competition; the loss of significant customers; technological and
pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for healthcare; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including nurses and physicians; the ability of the Company to successfully integrate its
acquisitions; the Company’s ability to finance growth on favorable terms; and, other factors referenced in the Company’s 2002 Form 10-K. Additionally, the Company’s financial statements reflect large amounts due from various
commercial payors and there can be no assurance that failure of the payors to remit amounts due to the Company will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future results of operations. Also, the Company has experienced a
significant increase in professional and general liability and property insurance expense caused by unfavorable pricing and availability trends of commercial insurance. As a result, the Company has assumed a greater portion of its liability risk and
there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in claims asserted against the Company which are self-insured, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future results of operations.
Given these uncertainties, prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Management disclaims any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any
of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.

Results of Operations

Net revenues increased 15% to $3.26 billion in 2002 as compared to 2001 and 27% to $2.84 billion in 2001 as compared to 2000. The $420 million increase in net revenues during 2002 as compared to 2001
primarily resulted from: (i) a $255 million or 9% increase in net revenues generated at acute care hospitals (located in the U.S., Puerto Rico and France) and behavioral health care facilities owned during both years, and; (ii) $159 million of
revenues generated at acute care and behavioral health care facilities acquired in the U.S. and France purchased at various times subsequent to January 1, 2001 (excludes revenues generated at these facilities one year after acquisition).

The $600 million increase in net revenues during
2001 as compared to 2000 resulted from: (i) a $276 million or 13% increase in net revenues generated at acute care and behavioral health care facilities owned during both years, and; (ii) $324 million of net revenues generated at acute care and
behavioral health care



facilities acquired in the U.S. and France since January 1, 2000 (excludes revenues generated at these facilities one year after
acquisition).

Net revenues from the
Company’s acute care facilities (including the nine hospitals located in France) and ambulatory treatment centers accounted for 82%, 81% and 84% of consolidated net revenues during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net revenues from the
Company’s behavioral health services facilities accounted for 17%, 19% and 16% of consolidated net revenues during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Operating income (defined as net revenues less salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses, supplies expense and provision for
doubtful accounts) increased 17% to $516 million in 2002 from $442 million in 2001. In 2001, operating income increased 23% to $442 million from $359 million in 2000. Overall operating margins (defined as operating income divided by net revenues)
were 15.8% in 2002, 15.6% in 2001 and 16.0% in 2000. The factors causing the fluctuations in the Company’s overall operating margins during the last three years are discussed below.

Below is a reconciliation of consolidated operating income to consolidated income before income taxes and the
extraordinary charge, recorded in 2001:

Net
income was $175.4 million in 2002 as compared to $99.7 million in 2001. The increase of approximately $76 million during 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily attributable to: (i) an increase of approximately $33 million, after-tax, in operating
income from acute care and behavioral health care facilities owned during both periods located in the U.S., Puerto Rico and France, due to the factors described below in Acute Care Services and Behavioral Health Services; (ii) an increase of
approximately $10 million, after-tax, in operating income from acute care and behavioral health care facilities acquired in the U.S., Puerto Rico and France during 2001 and 2002 (excludes operating income, after-tax, generated at these facilities
one year after acquisition); (iii) the 2001 period including $15.6 million of after-tax goodwill amortization expense which ceased upon the January 1, 2002 adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
(this decrease was substantially offset by an increase during 2002, in depreciation expense attributable to capital additions and acquisitions, including depreciation expense on the newly constructed 371-bed George Washington University Hospital
which opened during the third quarter of 2002), and; (iv) the 2001 period including approximately $31 million of after-tax charges relating to provision for insurance settlements, losses on foreign exchange contracts, derivative transactions and
debt extinguishment.

Acute Care Services

On a same facility basis, net revenues at the Company’s
acute care hospitals located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico increased 10% in 2002 as compared to 2001 and 14% in 2001 as compared to 2000. On a same facility basis, admissions and patient days increased 6.9% and 5.5%, respectively, in 2002 as
compared to 2001 as the average length of stay remained unchanged at 4.7 days. Admissions and patient days at the Company’s acute care hospitals located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico increased 4.8% and 5.7%, respectively, in 2001 as compared to
2000 as the average length of stay was 4.8 days in 2001 as compared to 4.7 days in 2000.

In addition to the increase in inpatient volumes, the Company’s same facility net revenues were favorably impacted by an increase in prices charged to private payors including health maintenance
organizations and preferred provider organizations as well as an increase in Medicare reimbursements which commenced on



April 1, 2001. On a same facility basis, at the Company’s acute care hospitals located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, net revenue per
adjusted admission (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased 3.6% and net revenue per adjusted patient day (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased 4.6% in 2002 as compared to 2001. Also on a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted
admission increased 8.4% and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 7.4% in 2001 as compared to 2000. Included in the same facility acute care financial results and patient statistical data are the operating results generated at the 60-bed
McAllen Heart Hospital which was acquired by the Company in March of 2001. Upon acquisition, the facility began operating under the same license as an integrated department of McAllen Medical Center and therefore the financial and statistical
results are not separable.

Despite the increase
in patient volume at the Company’s acute care hospitals, inpatient utilization continues to be negatively affected by payor-required, pre-admission authorization and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery
services for less acutely ill patients. The increase in net revenue was negatively affected by lower payments from the government under the Medicare program as a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (“BBA-97”) and discounts to
insurance and managed care companies (see General Trends). During 2002, 2001 and 2000, 43%, 43% and 44%, respectively, of the net patient revenues at the Company’s acute care facilities were derived from Medicare and Medicaid (excludes revenues
generated from managed Medicare and Medicaid programs). During 2002, 2001 and 2000, 37%, 36% and 35%, respectively, of the net patient revenues at the Company’s acute care facilities were derived from managed care companies which includes
health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Company anticipates that the percentage of its revenue from managed care business will continue to increase in the future. The Company
generally receives lower payments per patient from managed care payors than it does from traditional indemnity insurers.

At the Company’s acute care facilities located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, operating expenses (salaries, wages and benefits, other
operating expenses, supplies expense and provision for doubtful accounts) as a percentage of net revenues were 82.8% in 2002, 82.2% in 2001 and 81.4% in 2000. Operating margins (defined as net revenues less operating expenses divided by net
revenues) at these facilities were 17.2% in 2002, 17.8% in 2001 and 18.6% in 2000. On a same facility basis during 2002 as compared to 2001, operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues at the Company’s acute care hospitals located in the
U.S. and Puerto Rico were 82.5% in 2002 and 82.3% in 2001 as operating margins at these facilities were 17.5% in 2002 and 17.7% in 2001. On a same facility basis during 2001 as compared to 2000, operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues at
these facilities were 82.6% in 2001 and 81.6% in 2000 as operating margins at these facilities were 17.4% in 2001 and 18.4% in 2000.

Favorably impacting the operating margins at the Company’s acute care hospitals located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico during 2002 as
compared to 2001 was a reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts which, as a percentage of net revenues, decreased to 8.3% in 2002 as compared to 9.7% in 2001. This improvement was primarily attributable to more aggressive efforts to properly
categorize charges related to charity care, improved billing and collection procedures and an increase in collection of amounts previously reserved. Unfavorably impacting the operating margins at these facilities during 2002 as compared to 2001 was
an increase in other operating expenses which increased to 23.8% of net revenues in 2002 as compared to 22.5% in 2001 and an increase in salaries, wages and benefits which increased to 36.2% of net revenues in 2002 as compared to 35.5% in 2001. The
increase in other operating expenses was due primarily to a significant increase in professional and general liability insurance expense caused by unfavorable pricing and availability trends of commercial insurance (see General Trends). The increase
in salaries, wages and benefits was due primarily to rising labor rates particularly in the area of skilled nursing. The Company expects the expense factors mentioned above to continue to pressure future operating margins.

Despite the strong revenue growth experienced at the
Company’s acute care facilities during 2001 as compared to 2000, operating margins at these facilities were lower in 2001 as compared to the prior year due primarily to increases in salaries, wages and benefits, pharmaceutical expense and
insurance expense. Salaries,



wages and benefits increased primarily as a result of rising labor rates, particularly in the area of skilled nursing and the increase in
pharmaceutical expense was caused primarily by increased utilization of high-cost drugs. The Company experienced an increase in insurance expense on the self-insured retention limits at certain of its subsidiaries caused primarily by unfavorable
industry-wide pricing trends for hospital professional and general liability coverage.

Behavioral Health Services

On a same facility basis, net revenues at the Company’s behavioral health care facilities increased 4% in 2002 as compared to 2001
and 7% in 2001 as compared to 2000. Admissions and patient days at these facilities increased 6.4% and 5.2%, respectively, in 2002 as compared to 2001 as the average length of stay decreased to 11.9 days in 2002 as compared to 12.1 days in 2001.
Admissions and patient days at the Company’s behavioral health care facilities owned in both 2001 and 2000 increased 6.7% and 4.4%, respectively, in 2001 as compared to 2000 as the average length of stay decreased to 11.9 days in 2001 as
compared to 12.2 days in 2000.

On a same
facility basis, at the Company’s behavioral health care facilities, net revenue per adjusted admission (adjusted for outpatient activity) decreased 0.4% and net revenue per adjusted patient day (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased 1.1%
in 2002 as compared to 2001. Also on a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission increased 1.7% and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 4.2% in 2001 as compared to 2000.

Behavioral health facilities, which are excluded from the
inpatient services prospective payment system (“PPS”) applicable to acute care hospitals, are reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis by the Medicare program, but are generally subject to a per discharge ceiling, calculated based on an
annual allowable rate of increase over the hospital’s base year amount under the Medicare law and regulations. Capital-related costs are exempt from this limitation. In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (“BBA-97”), Congress
significantly revised the Medicare payment provisions for PPS-excluded hospitals, including behavioral health services facilities. Effective for Medicare cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, different caps are applied to
behavioral health services hospitals’ target amounts depending upon whether a hospital was excluded from PPS before or after that date, with higher caps for hospitals excluded before that date. Congress also revised the rate-of-increase
percentages for PPS-excluded hospitals and eliminated the new provider PPS-exemption for behavioral health hospitals. In addition, the Health Care Financing Administration, now known as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(“CMS”), has implemented requirements applicable to behavioral health services hospitals that share a facility or campus with another hospital. The Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Balance Budget Refinement Act of 1999 requires that CMS
develop a per diem PPS for inpatient services furnished by behavioral health hospitals under the Medicare program, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002. This PPS must include an adequate patient classification
system that reflects the differences in patient resource use and costs among these hospitals and must maintain budget neutrality. However implementation of this PPS for inpatient services furnished by behavioral health hospitals has been delayed
until the first quarter of 2004. Although Management of the Company believes the implementation of inpatient PPS may have a favorable effect on the Company’s future results of operations, Management can not predict the ultimate effect of
inpatient PPS on the Company’s future operating results until the provisions are finalized. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, 35%, 38% and 45%, respectively, of the net patient revenues at the Company’s behavioral health care facilities were
derived from Medicare and Medicaid (excludes revenues generated from managed Medicare and Medicaid programs). During 2002, 2001 and 2000, 48%, 39% and 35%, respectively, of the net patient revenues at the Company’s behavioral health care
facilities were derived from managed care companies which includes health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs.

At the Company’s behavioral health care facilities, operating expenses (salaries, wages and benefits,
other operating expenses, supplies expense and provision for doubtful accounts) as a percentage of net revenues were 79.8% in 2002, 81.0% in 2001 and 81.8% in 2000. The Company’s behavioral health care division generated



operating margins (defined as net revenues less operating expenses divided by net revenues) of 20.2% in 2002, 19.0% in 2001 and 18.2% in
2000. On a same facility basis during 2002 as compared to 2001, operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues at the Company’s behavioral health care facilities were 79.7% in 2002 and 81.0% in 2001 as operating margins at these facilities
were 20.3% in 2002 and 19.0% in 2001. On a same facility basis during 2001 as compared to 2000, operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues at these facilities were 80.3% in 2001 and 81.8% in 2000 as operating margins at these facilities were
19.7% in 2001 and 18.2% in 2000. In an effort to maintain and potentially further improve the operating margins at its behavioral health care facilities, management of the Company continues to implement cost controls and price increases and has also
increased its focus on receivables management.

Other
Operating Results

Combined net revenues
from the Company’s other operating entities including outpatient surgery centers, radiation centers and an 80% ownership interest in an operating company that owns nine hospitals in France increased to $161 million during 2002 as compared to
$113 million in 2001 and $61 million in 2000. The increase in combined net revenues in 2002 and 2001 as compared to 2000 was primarily attributable to the Company’s purchase, in March of 2001, of an 80% ownership interest in an operating
company that owns nine hospitals located in France. Combined operating margins from the Company’s other operating entities were 21.3% in 2002, 20.2% in 2001 and 15.1% in 2000.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded the following charges: (i) a $40.0 million pre-tax
charge to reserve for malpractice expenses that may result from the Company’s third party malpractice insurance company (PHICO) that was placed in liquidation in February, 2002 (see General Trends); (ii) a $7.4 million pre-tax loss on
derivative transactions resulting from the early termination of interest rate swaps, and; (iii) a $1.0 million after-tax ($1.6 million pre-tax) extraordinary expense resulting from the early redemption of the Company’s $135 million 8.75%
notes issued in 1995.

During the fourth quarter
of 2000, the Company recognized a pre-tax charge of $7.7 million to reflect the amount of an unfavorable jury verdict and reserve for future legal costs relating to an unprofitable facility that was closed during the first quarter of 2001. During
2001, an appellate court issued an opinion affirming the jury verdict and during the first quarter of 2002, the Company filed a petition for review by the Texas Supreme Court, which has accepted the case for review. During the fourth quarter of
2002, as a result of the sale of the real estate of this closed facility, the Company recorded a pre-tax $2.2 million recovery of facility closure costs. During 2002 and 2001, pending the outcome of the state supreme court review, the Company
recorded interest expense related to this unfavorable jury verdict of $700,000 in each year.

The Company recorded minority interest expense in the earnings of consolidated entities amounting to $19.7 million in 2002, $17.5 million in 2001 and $13.7 million in 2000. The minority interest
expense includes the minority ownerships’ share of the net income of four acute care facilities located in the U.S., three of which are located in Las Vegas, Nevada and one located in Washington, D.C., and nine acute care facilities located in
France (acquired during 2001).

Depreciation and
amortization expense was $124.8 million in 2002, $127.5 million in 2001 and $112.8 million in 2000. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” and accordingly,
ceased amortizing goodwill as of that date. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company recorded $24.7 million and $19.5 million of pre-tax goodwill amortization expense, respectively. Substantially offsetting the decrease during
2002 as compared to 2001 caused by the adoption of SFAS No. 142 was an increase in depreciation expense during 2002 attributable to capital additions and acquisitions, including depreciation expense on the newly constructed 371-bed George Washington
University Hospital which opened during the third quarter of 2002.

The effective tax rate was 36.7% in 2002, 36.2% in 2001 and 36.1% in 2000.



General Trends

A significant portion of the Company’s
revenue is derived from federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid (excluding managed Medicare and Medicaid programs), which accounted for 42%, 42% and 44% of the Company’s net patient revenues during 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively. Under the statutory framework of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, many of the Company’s operations are subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion which may affect payments made under either or both
of such programs. In addition, reimbursement is generally subject to audit and review by third party payors. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustment that might result therefrom.

The federal government makes payments to participating
hospitals under the Medicare program based on various formulas. The Company’s general acute care hospitals are subject to a prospective payment system (“PPS”). For inpatient services, PPS pays hospitals a predetermined amount per
diagnostic related group (“DRG”), for which payment amounts are adjusted to account for geographic wage differences. Beginning August 1, 2000 under an outpatient prospective payment system (“OPPS”) mandated by Congress in the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (“BBA-97”), both general acute and behavioral health hospitals are paid for outpatient services included in the OPPS according to ambulatory procedure codes (“APC”), which group together services that
are comparable both clinically and with respect to the use of resources. The payment for each item or service is determined by the APC to which it is assigned. The APC payment rates are calculated on a national basis and adjusted to account for
certain geographic wage differences. The Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (“BBRA of 1999”) included “transitional corridor payments” through fiscal year 2003, which provide some financial relief
for any hospital that generally incurs a reduction to its Medicare outpatient reimbursement under the new OPPS.

Behavioral health facilities, which are generally excluded from the inpatient services PPS are reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis by
the Medicare program, but are generally subject to a per discharge ceiling, calculated based on an annual allowable rate of increase over the hospital’s base year amount under the Medicare law and regulations. Capital-related costs are exempt
from this limitation. In the BBA-97, Congress significantly revised the Medicare payment provisions for PPS-excluded hospitals, including certain behavioral health services facilities. Effective for Medicare cost reporting periods beginning on or
after October 1, 1997, different caps are applied to certain behavioral health services hospitals’ target amounts depending upon whether a hospital was excluded from PPS before or after that date, with higher caps for hospitals excluded before
that date. Congress also revised the rate-of-increase percentages for PPS-excluded hospitals and eliminated the new provider PPS-exemption for behavioral health hospitals. In addition, the Health Care Financing Administration, now known as the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), has implemented requirements applicable to behavioral health services hospitals that share a facility or campus with another hospital. The BBRA of 1999 requires that CMS develop a per
diem PPS for inpatient services furnished by certain behavioral health hospitals under the Medicare program, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002. This PPS must include an adequate patient classification system
that reflects the differences in patient resource use and costs among these hospitals and must maintain budget neutrality. However implementation of this PPS for inpatient services furnished by certain behavioral health hospitals has been delayed
until the first quarter of 2004. Although Management of the Company believes the implementation of inpatient PPS may have a favorable effect on the Company’s future results of operations, Management can not predict the ultimate effect of
behavioral health inpatient PPS on the Company’s future operating results until the provisions are finalized.

In addition to the trends described above that continue to have an impact on the Company’s operating results, there are a number of
other more general factors affecting the Company’s business. BBA-97 called for the government to trim the growth of federal spending on Medicare by $115 billion and on Medicaid by $13 billion over the ensuing 5 years. This enacted
legislation also called for reductions in the future rate of increases to payments made to hospitals and reduced the amount of payments for outpatient services, bad debt expense and capital costs. Some of these reductions were temporarily reversed
with the passage of the Medicare,



Medicaid and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (“BIPA”) which, among other things, increased Medicare and
Medicaid payments to healthcare providers by $35 billion over the ensuing 5 years with approximately $12 billion of this amount targeted for hospitals and $11 billion for managed care payors. However, many of the payment reductions reversed by
Congress in BIPA are expiring. In addition, without further Congressional action, in fiscal year 2003 hospitals will receive less than a full market basket inflation adjustment for services paid under the inpatient PPS (inpatient PPS update of the
market basket minus 0.55 percentage points is estimated to equal 2.95% in fiscal year 2003), although CMS estimates that for the same time period, Medicare payment rates under OPPS will increase, for each service, by an average of
3.7 percent. In February, 2003, the federal fiscal year 2003 omnibus spending federal legislation was signed into law. This legislation includes approximately $800 million in increased spending for hospitals. More specifically, $300 million of
this amount is targeted for rural and certain urban hospitals effective for the period of April, 2003 through September, 2003. Certain of the Company’s hospitals are eligible for and are expected to receive the increased Medicare reimbursement
resulting from this legislation, however, the impact is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s future results of operations.

Certain Medicare inpatient hospital cases with extraordinarily high costs in relation to other cases within a given DRG may receive an
additional payment from Medicare (“Outlier Payments”). In general, to qualify for the additional Outlier Payments, the gross charges associated with an individual patient’s case must exceed the applicable standard DRG payment plus a
threshold established annually by CMS. In the federal 2003 fiscal year, the unadjusted Outlier Payment threshold increased to $33,560 from $21,025. Outlier Payments are currently subject to multiple factors including but not limited to: (i) the
hospital’s estimated operating costs based on its historical ratio of costs to gross charges; (ii) the patient’s case acuity; (iii) the CMS established threshold; and; (iv) the hospital’s geographic location. However, in February,
2003, CMS issued a proposed rule that would change the outlier formula in an effort to promote more accurate spending for outlier payments to hospitals. Management of the Company ultimately believes the increase in the Outlier Payments threshold and
potential change in the Outlier Payment methodology will result in a decrease in the overall Outlier Payments expected to be received by the Company during the 2003 federal fiscal year. This decrease is expected to substantially offset the increase
in Medicare payments resulting from the market basket inflation adjustment as mentioned above. The Company’s total Outlier Payments in 2002 were less than 1% of its consolidated net revenues and Management expects that Outlier Payments in 2003
will amount to less than 0.5% of the Company’s consolidated net revenues.

Within certain limits, a hospital can manage its costs, and to the extent this is done effectively, a hospital may benefit from the DRG system. However, many hospital operating costs are incurred in
order to satisfy licensing laws, standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (“JCAHO”) and quality of care concerns. In addition, hospital costs are affected by the level of patient acuity, occupancy
rates and local physician practice patterns, including length of stay and number and type of tests and procedures ordered. A hospital’s ability to control or influence these factors which affect costs is, in many cases, limited.

In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare
program, the Company receives a large portion of its revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid with a large concentration of the Company’s Medicaid revenues received from Texas,
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. The Company can provide no assurance that reductions to Medicaid revenues in any state in which it operates, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
future results of operations. Furthermore, the Company can provide no assurances that future reductions to federal and/or state budgets that contain certain further reductions or decreases in the rate of increase of Medicare and Medicaid spending,
will not adversely affect the Company’s future operations.

In 1991, the Texas legislature authorized the LoneSTAR Health Initiative, a pilot program in two areas of the state, to establish for Medicaid beneficiaries a healthcare delivery system based on managed care principles. The program
is now known as the STAR program, which is short for State of Texas Access Reform. Since 1995, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, with the help of other Texas agencies such as the Texas



Department of Health, has rolled out STAR Medicaid managed care pilot programs in several geographic areas of the state. Under the STAR
program, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission either contracts with health maintenance organizations in each area to arrange for covered services to Medicaid beneficiaries, or contracts directly with healthcare providers and oversees the
furnishing of care in the role of a case manager. Two carve-out pilot programs are the STAR+PLUS program, which provides long-term care to elderly and disabled Medicaid beneficiaries in the Harris County service area, and the NorthSTAR program,
which furnishes behavioral health services to Medicaid beneficiaries in the Dallas County service area. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission is currently seeking a waiver to extend a limited Medicaid benefits package to low income persons
with serious mental illness. The waiver is limited to individuals residing in Harris County or the NorthSTAR service areas. Effective in the fall of 1999, however, the Texas legislature imposed a moratorium on the implementation of additional pilot
programs until the 2001 legislative session. While Texas Senate Bill 1, effective September 1, 2001, directed the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to implement Medicaid cost containment measures including a statewide rollout of the primary
care case management program in non-STAR areas, expansion of this program has been delayed in response to concerns from hospitals and physicians. Although no legislation has passed yet, such actions could have a material unfavorable impact on the
reimbursement the Texas hospitals receive during the period of September, 2003 to September, 2005.

Upon meeting certain conditions, and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas’ and South Carolina’s low income patients,
five of the Company’s facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina became eligible and received additional reimbursement from each state’s disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) fund. In order to
receive DSH funds, the facility must qualify to receive such payments. To qualify for DSH funds in Texas, the facility must have either a disproportionate total number of inpatient days for Medicaid patients, a disproportionate percentage of all
inpatient days that are for Medicaid patients, or a disproportionate percentage of all inpatient days that are for low-income patients. Included in the Company’s financial results was an aggregate of $33.0 million in 2002, $32.6 million in 2001
and $28.9 million in 2000, related to DSH programs. The Office of Inspector General recently published a report indicating that Texas Medicaid may have overpaid Texas hospitals for DSH payments. Although it is not yet clear how this issue will be
resolved, it may have an adverse effect on the Company’s hospitals located in Texas that have significant Medicaid populations. Both states have renewed their programs for the 2003 fiscal years, however, failure to renew these programs beyond
their scheduled termination date (June 30, 2003 for South Carolina and August 31, 2003 for Texas), failure to qualify for DSH funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements (including reductions related to the potential Texas Medicaid
overpayments mentioned above), could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future results of operations.

The healthcare industry is subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations which include, among other things, participation
requirements of federal and state health care programs, various licensure and accreditation requirements, reimbursement rules for patient services, False Claims Act provisions, patient privacy rules and Medicare and Medicaid anti-fraud and abuse
provisions. Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in federal and state healthcare programs, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from government for
previously billed patient services. While management of the Company believes its policies, procedures and practices comply with applicable laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that the Company will not be subjected to governmental
inquiries or actions or that governmental authorities may not find the Company to be in violation of a law or regulation as a result of an inquiry or action.

The Company voluntarily maintains a corporate compliance program. The program is designed to monitor and raise awareness of various
regulatory issues among employees, to stress the importance of complying with all federal and state laws and regulations and to promote the Company’s standards of conduct. As part of the program, the Company provides ethics and compliance
training to its employees. The Company also provides additional compliance training in specialized areas to the employees responsible for these areas. The program encourages all employees to report any potential or perceived violations directly to
the applicable compliance officer or to the Company through the use of a toll-free telephone hotline or a compliance post office box.



Pressures to
control health care costs and a shift away from traditional Medicare to Medicare managed care plans have resulted in an increase in the number of patients whose health care coverage is provided under managed care plans. Approximately 39% in 2002,
37% in 2001 and 35% in 2000, of the Company’s net patient revenues were generated from managed care companies, which includes health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs. In
general, the Company expects the percentage of its business from managed care programs to continue to grow. The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of the Company’s
facilities vary among the markets in which the Company operates. Typically, the Company receives lower payments per patient from managed care payors than it does from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past two years, the Company
secured price increases from many of its commercial payors including managed care companies.

Due to unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional and general liability insurance markets, the Company’s subsidiaries have assumed a greater portion of the hospital
professional and general liability risk as the cost of commercial professional and general liability insurance coverage has risen significantly. As a result, effective January 1, 2002, most of the Company’s subsidiaries were self-insured for
malpractice exposure up to $25 million per occurrence. The Company, on behalf of its subsidiaries, purchased an umbrella excess policy through a commercial insurance carrier for coverage in excess of $25 million per occurrence with a $75 million
aggregate limitation. Total insurance expense including professional and general liability, property, auto and workers’ compensation, was approximately $25 million higher in 2002 as compared to 2001. Given these insurance market conditions,
there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in claims asserted against the Company, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future results of operations.

For the period from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2001,
most of the Company’s subsidiaries were covered under professional and general liability insurance policies with PHICO, a Pennsylvania-based commercial insurance company. Certain subsidiaries, including hospitals located in Washington, D.C.,
Puerto Rico and south Texas were covered under policies with various coverage limits up to $5 million per occurrence through December 31, 2001. The majority of the remaining subsidiaries were covered under policies, which provided for a
self-insured retention limit up to $1 million per occurrence, with an annual aggregate of approximately $4 million in 1998, $5 million in 1999, $7 million in 2000 and $11 million in 2001. These subsidiaries maintain excess coverage up to $100
million with other major insurance carriers.

Early in the first quarter of 2002, PHICO was placed in liquidation by the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a $40 million pre-tax charge to earnings to accrue
for its estimated liability that resulted from this event. Management estimated this liability based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims
based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of unasserted claims based on historical experience, and estimated recoveries from state guaranty funds.

When PHICO entered liquidation proceedings, each state’s department of insurance was required to declare
PHICO as insolvent or impaired. That designation effectively triggers coverage under the applicable state’s insurance guarantee association, which operates as replacement coverage, subject to the terms, conditions and limits set forth in that
particular state. Therefore, the Company is entitled to receive reimbursement from those state’s guarantee funds for which it meets the eligibility requirements. In addition, the Company may be entitled to receive reimbursement from
PHICO’s estate for a portion of the claims ultimately paid by the Company. Management expects that the remaining cash payments related to these claims will be made over the next seven years as the cases are settled or adjudicated.

Included in other assets as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
were estimates of approximately $37 million and $54 million, respectively, representing expected recoveries from various state guaranty funds. The reduction in estimated recoveries as of December 31, 2002 as compared to December 31, 2001 is due to
Management’s



reassessment of its ultimate liability for general and professional liability claims relating to the period from 1998 through 2001, its
estimate of related recoveries under state guaranty funds, and payments received during 2002 from such state guaranty funds. While Management continues to monitor the factors used in making these estimates, the Company’s ultimate liability for
professional and general liability claims and its actual recoveries from state guaranty funds, could change materially from current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates. Therefore, there can be no assurance
that changes in these estimates, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.

As of December 31, 2002, the total accrual for the Company’s professional and general liability claims,
including all PHICO related claims was $168.2 million ($131.2 million net of expected recoveries from state guaranty funds), of which $12.0 million is included in other current liabilities. As of December 31, 2001, the total reserve for the
Company’s professional and general liability claims was $158.1 million ($104.1 million net of expected recoveries from state guaranty funds), of which $26.0 million is included in other current liabilities.

The Company maintains a non-contributory defined benefit plan
which covers the employees of one of the Company’s subsidiaries. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee’s highest compensation for any five years of employment. The Company’s funding policy is to contribute
annually at least the minimum amount that should be funded in accordance with the provisions of ERISA. The plan had invested assets with a market value as of December 31, 2002 of $42.9 million of which approximately 70% were invested in equity based
securities and 30% in fixed income securities. As a result of the unfavorable general market conditions and lower than anticipated returns on assets, the Company believes its expense related to this plan will be $3 million higher in 2003 as compared
to 2002.

Privacy and Security Requirements under the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) was enacted in August, 1996 to assure health insurance portability, reduce healthcare fraud and abuse, guarantee security and privacy of health information
and enforce standards for health information. Provisions not yet finalized are required to be implemented two years after the effective date of the regulation. Organizations are subject to significant fines and penalties if found not to be compliant
with the provisions outlined in the regulations. Regulations related to HIPAA are expected to impact the Company and others in the healthcare industry by:

(i)

Establishing standardized code sets for financial and clinical electronic data interchange (“EDI”) transactions to enable more efficient flow of
information. Currently there is no common standard for the transfer of information between the constituents in healthcare and therefore providers have had to conform to each standard utilized by every party with which they interact. One of the goals
of HIPAA is to create one common national standard for EDI and once the HIPAA regulation takes effect, payors will be required to accept the national standard employed by providers. The final regulations establishing electronic data transmission
standards that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically were published in August 2000 and compliance with these regulations is required by October 2003, if a request for a one-year
extension for compliance was properly submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services. The Company was granted the one-year extension.

(ii)

Mandating the adoption of privacy standards to protect the confidentiality and privacy of health information. Prior to HIPAA there were no federally recognized
healthcare standards governing the privacy of health information that includes all the necessary components to protect the data integrity and confidentiality of a patient’s electronically maintained or transmitted personal health record. The
final modifications to the privacy regulations were published in August 2002. Most covered entities must comply with the privacy regulations by April 2003.



(iii)

Creating unique identifiers for the four constituents in healthcare: payors, providers, patients and employers. HIPAA mandates the need for the unique identifiers
for healthcare providers in an effort to ease the administrative challenge of maintaining and transmitting clinical data across disparate episodes of patient care.

(iv)

Requiring covered entities to establish procedures and mechanisms to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health
information. The rule requires covered entities to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect electronic protected health information that they receive, store, or transmit. Most covered entities will have until April,
2005 to comply with these security standards. The Company believes that it will be able to comply; however, the cost of compliance cannot yet be ascertained.

The Company is in the process of implementing the necessary changes required pursuant to HIPAA. The Company
expects that the implementation cost of the HIPAA related modifications will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Market Risks Associated with Financial Instruments

The Company’s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. To
mitigate the impact of fluctuations in domestic interest rates, a portion of the Company’s debt is fixed rate accomplished by either borrowing on a long-term basis at fixed rates or by entering into interest rate swap transactions. The interest
rate swap agreements are contracts that require the Company to pay fixed and receive floating interest rates over the life of the agreements. The floating-rates are based on LIBOR and the fixed-rate is determined at the time the swap agreement is
consummated.

As of December 31, 2002, the
Company had three U.S. dollar interest rate swaps. One fixed rate swap with a notional principal amount of $125 million expires in August 2005. The Company pays a fixed rate of 6.76% and receives a floating rate equal to three month LIBOR. As of
December 31, 2002, the effective floating rate of this interest rate swap was 1.40%. The Company is also a party to two floating rate swaps having a notional principal amount of $60 million in which the Company receives a fixed rate of 6.75% and
pays a floating rate equal to 6 month LIBOR plus a spread. The initial term of these swaps was ten years and they are both scheduled to expire on November 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2002, the average floating rate of the $60 million of interest
rate swaps was 2.68%.

As of December 31, 2002, a
majority-owned subsidiary of the Company had two interest rate swaps denominated in Euros. These two interest rate swaps are for a total notional amount of 41.2 million Euros ($40.9 million based on the end of period currency exchange rate).
The notional amount decreases to 35.0 million Euros ($34.8 million) on December 30, 2003, 27.5 million Euros, ($27.3 million) on December 30, 2004 and the swaps mature on June 30, 2005. The Company pays an average fixed rate of 4.35% and receives
six month EURIBOR. The effective floating rate for these swaps as of December 31, 2002 was 2.87%.

The interest rate swap agreements do not constitute positions independent of the underlying exposures. The Company does not hold or issue
derivative instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any instruments with leverage features. The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its financial instruments. The counterparties
are creditworthy financial institutions, rated AA or better by Moody’s Investor Services and the Company anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. For the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company received weighted average rates of 3.5%, 5.9% and 7.2%, respectively, and paid a weighted average rate on its interest rate swap agreements of 5.7% in 2002, 6.9% in 2001 and 7.5% in 2000.

The table below presents information about the Company’s
derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including long-term debt and interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2002. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows
and related



weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates. For interest rate swap agreements, the table presents notional amounts by
maturity date and weighted average interest rates based on rates in effect at December 31, 2002. The fair values of long-term debt and interest rate swaps were determined based on market prices quoted at December 31, 2002, for the same or similar
debt issues.

Maturity Date, Fiscal Year Ending
December 31

(Dollars in thousands)

(a)

The fair value of the Company’s 5% Convertible Debentures (“Debentures”) at December 31, 2002 is $375 million, however, the Company has the right to
redeem the Debentures any time on or after June 23, 2006 at a price equal to the issue price of the Debentures plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest to the date of redemption. On June 23, 2006 the amount necessary to redeem
all Debentures would be $319 million. If the Debentures could be redeemed at the same basis at December 31, 2002 the redemption amount would be $276 million. The holders of the Debentures may convert the Debentures to the Company’s Class B
stock at any time. If all Debentures were converted, the result would be the issuance of 6.6 million shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock.

Effects of Inflation and Seasonality

Although inflation has not had a material impact on the Company’s results of operations over the last
three years, the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are rising supply costs which tend to escalate as vendors pass on the rising costs through price increases. The
Company’s acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of the tight labor market,



including a shortage of nurses, which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in the Company’s salaries, wages and benefits
expense in excess of the inflation rate. In addition, due to unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional and general liability insurance markets, the cost of commercial professional and general liability insurance coverage has
risen significantly. As a result, on an annual basis, the Company’s total insurance expense, including professional and general liability, property, auto and workers’ compensation, was approximately $25 million higher in 2002 as compared
to 2001 and is expected to increase by approximately $9 million or 15% in 2003 as compared to 2002. The Company’s subsidiaries have also assumed a greater portion of the hospital professional and general liability risk.

Although the Company cannot predict its ability to continue to
cover future cost increases, Management believes that through adherence to cost containment policies, labor management and reasonable price increases, the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable. However, the
Company’s ability to pass on these increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit the
Company’s ability to increase prices. In addition, as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and a continuing industry wide shift of patients into managed care plans, the Company’s ability to maintain margins through
price increases to non-Medicare patients is limited.

The Company’s business is seasonal, with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the Company’s year. This seasonality occurs because, generally, more people become ill
during the winter months, which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in the Company’s hospitals during those months.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash provided by operating activities was $331 million in 2002, $298 million in 2001 and $175 million in 2000. The $33 million
increase during 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily attributable to: (i) a favorable $23 million change due to an increase in net income plus the addback of adjustments to reconcile net cash provided by operating activities (depreciation &
amortization, accretion of discount on convertible debentures, losses on foreign exchange, derivative transactions & debt extinguishment and provision for insurance settlements and other non-cash charges); (ii) a $36 million unfavorable change
in accounts receivable (partially due to the timing of Medicare settlements and the increased patient volume and revenue at the new George Washington University Hospital which opened during the third quarter of 2002); (iii) a $19 million favorable
change in accrued insurance expense net of payments made in settlement of self-insurance claims and commercial premiums paid caused primarily by the Company’s subsidiaries assuming a greater portion of the professional and general liability
risk beginning in January, 2002; (iv) a $17 million favorable change due to timing of income tax payments, and; (v) $10 million of other net favorable working capital changes.

The $123 million increase during 2001 as compared to 2000 was primarily attributable to: (i) a favorable $69
million change due to an increase in net income plus the addback of adjustments to reconcile net cash provided by operating activities (depreciation & amortization, accretion of discount on convertible debentures, losses on foreign exchange,
derivative transactions & debt extinguishment and provision for insurance settlement and other non-cash charges); (ii) an unfavorable $38 million change due to timing of net income tax payments; (iii) a $31 favorable change in accounts
receivable; (iv) a $28 million favorable change in other assets and deferred charges, and; (v) $33 million of other net favorable working capital changes. Included in the $69 million favorable change in income plus the addback of adjustments to
reconcile net cash provided by operating activities was a pre-tax $40 million non-cash reserve established during the fourth quarter of 2001 related to the liquidation of PHICO, the Company’s third party hospital professional and general
liability insurance company (see General Trends). The increase in net income taxes paid during 2001 was due to a reduction in the 2000 net income tax payments resulting primarily from higher tax benefits from employee stock options and the decreases
in accrued taxes attributable to overpayments in 1999. The $31 million favorable change in accounts receivable resulted from improved accounts receivable management during 2001.



Capital
expenditures were $201 million in 2002, $153 million in 2001 and $114 million in 2000. Included in the 2002 capital expenditures were costs related to the completion of the new George Washington University Hospital located in Washington, D.C.
(opened in August, 2002), a 56-bed patient tower at Auburn Regional Medical Center located in Auburn, Washington (opened in January 2003) and the first phase of a new 176-bed acute care hospital located in Las Vegas, Nevada (scheduled to be
completed in the fourth quarter of 2003). Capital expenditures for capital equipment, renovations and new projects at existing hospitals and completion of major construction projects in progress at December 31, 2002 are expected to total
approximately $225 million to $240 million in 2003. Included in the 2003 projected capital expenditures are the expenditures on a major new cardiology wing and 90-bed expansion of Northwest Texas Healthcare System located in Amarillo, Texas
(scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2003) and construction of a new 120-bed acute care hospital in Manatee County, Florida (scheduled to open in May, 2004). Included in the 2001 capital expenditures were costs related to the
completion of a 180-bed acute care hospital located in Laredo, Texas and the 126-bed addition to the Desert Springs Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Company believes that its capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip its
existing hospitals.

During 2002, the Company
spent $3 million to acquire a majority ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center located in Puerto Rico. During 2001, the Company spent $263 million to acquire the assets and operations of: (i) four acute care facilities located in the U.S.
(two of which were effective on January 1, 2002); (ii) two behavioral health care facilities located in the U.S. and one located in Puerto Rico; (iii) an 80% ownership interest in a French hospital company that owns nine hospitals located in France,
and; (iv) majority ownership interests in two ambulatory surgery centers. During 2000, the Company spent $141 million to acquire the assets and operations of twelve behavioral health care facilities and two acute care hospitals and $12 million to
acquire a minority ownership interest in an e-commerce marketplace for the purchase and sale of health care supplies, equipment and services to the healthcare industry.

During 2002, the Company received net cash proceeds of $8 million resulting from the sale of real estate
related to a women’s hospital and radiation oncology center both of which were closed in a prior year and written down to their estimated net realizable values. The sale of the real property of the women’s hospital resulted in a $2.2
million recovery of closure costs and the net gain on the sale of the assets of the radiation therapy center did not have a material impact on the 2002 results of operations. During 2000, the Company received net cash proceeds of $16 million
resulting from the divestiture of the real property of a behavioral health care facility located in Florida, a medical office building located in Nevada, and its ownership interests in a specialized women’s health center and two physician
practices located in Oklahoma. The net gain/loss resulting from these transactions did not have a material impact on the 2000 results of operations

During 1998 and 1999, the Company’s Board of Directors approved stock purchase programs authorizing the Company to purchase up to 12
million shares of its outstanding Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. Pursuant to the terms of these programs, the Company purchased 2.4 million shares at an average
purchase price of $14.95 per share ($36.0 million in the aggregate) during 2000, 178,000 shares at an average purchase price of $43.33 per share ($7.7 million in the aggregate) during 2001 and 1.7 million shares at an average purchase price of
$44.71 per share ($76.6 million in the aggregate) during 2002. Since inception of the stock purchase program in 1998 through December 31, 2002, the Company purchased a total of 9.5 million shares at an average purchase price of $22.74 per share
($216.4 million in the aggregate).

In April,
2001, the Company declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend which was paid on June 1, 2001 to shareholders of record as of May 16, 2001. All classes of common stock participated on a pro rata basis and all references to
share quantities and earnings per share for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.

The Company has a $400 million unsecured non-amortizing revolving credit agreement, which expires on December 13, 2006. The agreement
includes a $50 million sublimit for letters of credit of which $29 million was



available at December 31, 2002. The interest rate on borrowings is determined at the Company’s option at the prime rate, certificate of
deposit rate plus .925% to 1.275%, LIBOR plus .80% to 1.150% or a money market rate. A facility fee ranging from .20% to .35% is required on the total commitment. The margins over the certificate of deposit, the LIBOR rates and the facility fee are
based upon the Company’s leverage ratio. At December 31, 2002, the applicable margins over the certificate of deposit and the LIBOR rate were 1.125% and 1.00%, respectively, and the commitment fee was .25 %. There are no compensating balance
requirements. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $349 million of unused borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit agreement.

During 2001, the Company issued $200 million of Senior Notes which have a 6.75% coupon rate and which mature on November 15, 2011.
(“Notes”). The interest on the Notes is paid semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The notes can be redeemed in whole at any time and in part from time to time.

The Company also has a $100 million commercial paper credit
facility. The majority of the Company’s acute care patient accounts receivable are pledged as collateral to secure this commercial paper program. A commitment fee of .40% is required on the used portion and .20% on the unused portion of the
commitment. This annually renewable program, which began in November 1993, is scheduled to expire or be renewed in October of each year. Outstanding amounts of commercial paper which can be refinanced through available borrowings under the
Company’s revolving credit agreement are classified as long-term. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had no unused borrowing capacity under the terms of the commercial paper facility.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company redeemed all of
its outstanding $135.0 million, 8.75% Senior Notes (“Senior Notes”) due 2005 for an aggregate redemption price of $136.5 million. The redemption of the Senior Notes was financed with borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper and
revolving credit facilities. In connection with the redemption of the Senior Notes, the Company recorded a net loss on debt extinguishment of $1.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2001.

The Company issued discounted Convertible Debentures in 2000
which are due in 2020 (“Debentures”). The aggregate issue price of the Debentures was $250 million or $587 million aggregate principal amount at maturity. The Debentures were issued at a price of $425.90 per $1,000 principal amount of
Debenture. The Debentures’ yield to maturity is 5% per annum, .426% of which is cash interest. The interest on the bonds is paid semiannually in arrears on June 23 and December 23 of each year. The Debentures are convertible at the option of
the holders into 5.6024 shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock per $1,000 of Debentures, however, the Company has the right to redeem the Debenture any time on or after June 23, 2006 at a price equal to the issue price of the Debentures
plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest to the date of redemption.

During 2002, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into a senior credit agreement denominated in Euros amounting to 45.8 million Euros ($44.9 million based on the end of period currency
exchange rate.) The loan, which is non-recourse to the Company, amortizes to zero over the life of the agreement and matures on December 31, 2007. Interest on the loan is at the option of the Company’s majority-owned subsidiary and can be based
on the one, two, three and six month EURIBOR plus a spread of 2.5%. As of December 31, 2002, the interest rate was 5.4% and the effective interest rate including the effects of the designated interest rate swaps was 6.9%.

The average amounts outstanding during 2002, 2001 and 2000
under the revolving credit and demand notes and commercial paper program were $140.3 million, $220.0 million and $170.0 million, respectively, with corresponding effective interest rates of 3.3%, 5.1% and 7.4% including commitment and facility fees.
The maximum amounts outstanding at any month-end were, $170.0 million in 2002, $343.9 million in 2001 and $270.9 million in 2000.



Total debt as
a percentage of total capitalization was 43% at December 31, 2002 and 47% at December 31, 2001.

The Company has two floating rate swaps having a notional principal amount of $60 million in which the Company receives a fixed rate of 6.75% and pays a floating rate equal to 6 month LIBOR plus a
spread. The term of these swaps is ten years and they are both scheduled to expire on November 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2002, the average floating rate of the $60 million of interest rate swaps was 2.68%. During 2002 the Company recorded a
decrease of $8.0 million in other assets to recognize the fair value of these swaps and a $8.0 million increase of long term debt to recognize the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the related hedged liability.

As of December 31, 2002, the Company has one fixed rate swap
with a notional principal amount of $125 million which expires in August 2005. The Company pays a fixed rate of 6.76% and receives a floating rate equal to three month LIBOR. As of December 31, 2002, the floating rate of this interest rate swap
was 1.40%.

As of December 31, 2002, a
majority-owned subsidiary of the Company had two interest rate swaps denominated in Euros. These two interest rate swaps are for a total notional amount of 41.2 million Euros ($40.9 million based on the end of period currency exchange rate). The
notional amount decreases to 35.0 million Euros ($34.8 million) on December 30, 2003, 27.5 million Euros, ($27.3 million) on December 30, 2004 and the swaps mature on June 30, 2005. The Company pays an average fixed rate of 4.35% and receives six
month EURIBOR. The effective floating rate for these swaps as of December 31, 2002 was 2.87%.

During the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), pre-tax losses of $6.4 million ($4.1 million after-tax) to recognize
the change in fair value of all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. The income or losses are reclassified into earnings as the underlying hedged item affects earnings, such as when the forecasted interest payment
occurs. Assuming market rates remain unchanged from December 31, 2002, it is expected that $7.2 million of pre-tax net losses in accumulated AOCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. During the year ended December 31,
2002, the Company also recorded $169,000 ($107,000 after-tax) to recognize the ineffective portion of the cash flow hedging instruments. As of December 31, 2002, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the
variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions is through August 2005.

Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, the Company recorded the cumulative effect of an accounting change of approximately $7.6 million ($4.8 million after-tax) in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) to recognize the fair value of all derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedging instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded, in AOCI, a pre-tax charge of $2.4 million ($1.5 million
after-tax) to recognize the change in fair value of all derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedging instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company also recorded a charge to earnings of approximately $300,000 ($200,000
after-tax) to recognize the ineffective portion of its cash flow hedging instruments.

The Company had a fixed rate swap having a notional principal amount of $135 million whereby the Company paid a fixed rate of 6.76% and received a floating rate from the counter-party. During 2001, the
notional amount of this swap was reduced to $125 million. The Company had two interest rate swaps to fix the rate of interest on a total notional principal amount of $75 million with a scheduled maturity date of August, 2005 that were terminated in
November, 2001. The average fixed rate on the $75 million of interest rate swaps including the Company’s borrowing spread of .35%, was 7.05%. The total cost of all swaps terminated in 2001 was $7.4 million. This amount was reclassified from
accumulated other comprehensive loss due to the probability of the original forecasted interest payments not occurring.

The effective interest rate on the Company’s revolving credit, demand notes and commercial paper program, including the respective
interest expense and income incurred on existing and now expired designated interest



rate swaps, was 6.3%, 6.4% and 7.1% during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Additional interest (expense)/income recorded as a result of
the Company’s U.S. dollar denominated hedging activity was ($4,228,000) in 2002, ($2,730,000) in 2001 and $414,000 in 2000. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counter-party to the interest rate swap
agreements. All of the counter-parties are creditworthy financial institutions rated AA or better by Moody’s Investor Service and the Company does not anticipate non-performance. The estimated fair value of the cost to the Company to terminate
the interest rate swap obligations, including the Euro denominated interest rate swaps, at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was approximately $10.4 million and $11.7 million, respectively.

Covenants relating to long-term debt require maintenance of a minimum net worth, specified debt to total
capital and fixed charge coverage ratios. The Company is in compliance with all required covenants as of December 31, 2002.

The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was approximately $791.1 million and $751.5 million,
respectively.

The Company expects to finance all
capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated funds and borrowed funds. Additional borrowed funds may be obtained either through refinancing the existing revolving credit agreement and/or the commercial paper facility and/or the
issuance of equity or long-term debt.

Significant Accounting Policies

The Company has determined that the following accounting
policies and estimates are critical to the understanding of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition:

Revenue and the related receivables for health care services are recorded in the accounting records, at the
time the services are rendered, on an accrual basis at the Company’s established charges. The provision for contractual adjustments, which represents the difference between established charges and estimated third-party payor payments, is also
recognized on an accrual basis and deducted from gross revenue to determine net revenues. Payment arrangements with third-party payors may include prospectively determined rates per discharge, a discount from established charges, per-diem payments
and reimbursed costs. Estimates of contractual adjustments are reported in the period during which the services are provided and adjusted in future periods, as the actual amounts become known. Revenues recorded under cost-based reimbursement
programs may be adjusted in future periods as a result of audits, reviews or investigations. Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to



interpretation. As a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near
term. Medicare and Medicaid net revenues represented 42%, 42% and 44% of net patient revenues for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In addition, approximately 39% in 2002, 37% in 2001 and 35% in 2000, of the Company’s net patient
revenues were generated from managed care companies, which includes health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations.

The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce its receivables to their net realizable value. The allowances are
estimated by management based on general factors such as payor mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $59.1
million and $61.1 million, respectively.

The
Company provides care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than its established rates. Because the Company does not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity
care, they are not reported in net revenues or in provision for doubtful accounts.

Self-Insured Risks:

The Company provides for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers’ compensation claims, based on
estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred by not reported.

The ultimate costs of such claims, which include costs associated with litigating or settling claims, are accrued when the incidents that give rise to the claims occur. Estimated losses from asserted
and unasserted claims are accrued, based on Management’s estimates of the ultimate costs of the claims and the relationship of past reported incidents to eventual claims payments. All relevant information, including the Company’s own
historical experience, the nature and extent of existing asserted claims, and reported incidents, and independent actuarial analyses of this information, is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. The accrual also includes an estimate of
the losses that will result from unreported incidents, which are probable of having occurred before the end of the reporting period.

In addition, the Company also maintains self-insured employee benefits programs for healthcare and dental claims. The ultimate costs
related to these programs includes expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.

Estimated losses are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at
each reporting date. The amounts of the changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.

Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements for additional information on other accounting policies and new accounting
pronouncements.

Related Party Transactions:

At December 31, 2002, the Company held approximately 6.6% of
the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the “Trust”). The Company serves as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement. Pursuant to the terms of this advisory agreement, the Company conducts
the Trust’s day to day affairs, provides administrative services and presents investment opportunities. In addition, certain officers and directors of the Company are also officers and/or directors of the Trust. Management believes that it has
the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore the Company accounts for its investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting. The Company’s pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $1.4 million during
2002, $1.3 million during 2001 and $1.2 million during 2000, and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The carrying value of this investment was $9.1 million and $9.0 million at December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The market value of this investment was $20.3 million at December 31, 2002 and $18.0 million at December 31, 2001.



As of December
31, 2002, the Company leased six hospital facilities from the Trust with terms expiring in 2004 through 2008. These leases contain up to six 5-year renewal options. During 2002, the Company exercised the five-year renewal option on an acute care
hospital leased from the Trust which was scheduled to expire in 2003. The renewal rate on this facility is based upon the five year Treasury rate on March 29, 2003 plus a spread. Future minimum lease payments to the Trust are included in Note 7.
Total rent expense under these operating leases was $17.2 million in 2002, $16.5 million in 2001 and $17.1 million in 2000. The terms of the lease provide that in the event the Company discontinues operations at the leased facility for more than one
year, the Company is obligated to offer a substitute property. If the Trust does not accept the substitute property offered, the Company is obligated to purchase the leased facility back from the Trust at a price equal to the greater of its then
fair market value or the original purchase price paid by the Trust. As of December 31, 2002, the aggregate fair market value of the Company’s facilities leased from the Trust is not known, however, the aggregate original purchase price paid by
the Trust for these properties was $112.5 million. The Company received an advisory fee from the Trust of $1.4 million in 2002 and $1.3 million in both 2001 and 2000 for investment and administrative services provided under a contractual agreement
which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

During 2000, the Company sold the real property of a medical office building to a limited liability company that is majority owned by the Trust for cash proceeds of approximately $10.5 million. Tenants
in the multi-tenant building include subsidiaries of the Company as well as unrelated parties.

In connection with a long-term incentive compensation plan that was terminated during the third quarter of 2002, the Company had $18 million as of December 31, 2002 and $21 million as of December 31,
2001, of gross loans outstanding to various employees of which $15 million as of December 31, 2002 and $18 million as of December 31, 2001 were charged to compensation expense through that date. Included in the gross loan amounts outstanding were
loans to officers of the Company amounting to $13 million as of December 31, 2002 and $16 million as of December 31, 2001 (see Note 5).

The Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is member of the Board of Directors of Broadlane, Inc. In addition, the Company
and certain members of executive management own approximately 6% of the outstanding shares of Broadlane, Inc. as of December 31, 2002. Broadlane, Inc. provides contracting and other supply chain services to various healthcare organizations,

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

(ITEM 14(a))



INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Universal Health Services, Inc.:

We have audited the 2002 financial statements of Universal Health Services, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. In connection with our audit of the 2002
financial statements, we have also audited the 2002 financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audit. The 2001 and 2000 financial statements and financial statement schedule of Universal Health Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as listed in the
accompanying index were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule, before the revisions as described in Note 1 to the
financial statements, in their report dated February 13, 2002.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the 2002 financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Universal Health Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related 2002 financial statement schedule when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed above, the financial statements of
Universal Health Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, and for each of the years in the two-year period then ended, were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Note 1, the financial statements have
been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which was adopted as of January 1, 2002. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2001
and 2000 in Note 1 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 and 2000 financial statements of Universal Health Services, Inc. and subsidiaries other than with respect to such disclosures, and
accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 and 2000 financial statements taken as a whole.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Universal Health Services, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Universal Health Services, Inc. (a Delaware
corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, common stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Universal Health Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1)    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Universal Health Services, Inc. (the “Company”), its majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships controlled by the Company or
its subsidiaries as the managing general partner. The Company’s France subsidiary is included on the basis of the year ending November 30th. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The more significant
accounting policies follow:

Nature of
Operations:

The principal business of the Company is owning and operating, through its subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers. At December
31, 2002, the Company operated 34 acute care hospitals and 38 behavioral health centers located in 22 states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico and France. The Company, as part of its ambulatory treatment centers division owns outright, or in partnership
with physicians, and operates or manages 24 surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 12 states and Puerto Rico.

Services provided by the Company’s hospitals include general surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology,
diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services and behavioral health services. The Company provides capital resources as well as a variety of management services to its facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and
control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.

Net revenues from the Company’s acute care hospitals and ambulatory and outpatient treatment centers accounted for 82%, 81% and 84%
of consolidated net revenues in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net revenues from the Company’s behavioral health care facilities accounted for 17%, 19% and 16%, of consolidated net revenues in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Revenue
Recognition:

Revenue and the related receivables for health care services are recorded in the accounting records, at the time the services are rendered, on an accrual basis at the Company’s established charges. The
provision for contractual adjustments, which represents the difference between established charges and estimated third-party payor payments, is also recognized on an accrual basis and deducted from gross revenue to determine net revenues. Payment
arrangements with third-party payors may include prospectively determined rates per discharge, a discount from established charges, per-diem payments and reimbursed costs. Estimates of contractual adjustments are reported in the period during which
the services are provided and adjusted in future periods, as the actual amounts become known. Revenues recorded under cost-based reimbursement programs may be adjusted in future periods as a result of audits, reviews or investigations. Laws and
regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term. Medicare
and Medicaid net revenues represented 42%, 42% and 44% of net patient revenues for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In addition, approximately 39% in 2002, 37% in 2001, 35% in 2000, of the Company’s net patient revenues were
generated from managed care companies, which includes health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations.

The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce its receivables to their net realizable value. The allowances are
estimated by management based on general factors such as payor mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $59.1
million and $61.1 million, respectively.

The
Company provides care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than its established rates. Because the Company does not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity
care, they are not reported in net revenues or in provision for doubtful accounts.



Concentration of Revenues:

The three majority-owned facilities operating in the Las Vegas market contributed on a combined basis 15% of the Company’s 2002 consolidated net revenues. The two
facilities located in the McAllen/Edinburg, Texas market contributed, on a combined basis, 11% of the Company’s 2002 consolidated net revenues.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. Interest expense in the consolidated statements of income is net of interest income of approximately $600,000 in 2002, $1.9 million in 2001 and $2.7 million in 2000.

Property and Equipment:

Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements are charged to the property accounts. Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred. The
Company removes the cost and the related accumulated depreciation from the accounts for assets sold or retired and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations.

The Company capitalizes interest expense on major construction projects while in process. The Company
capitalized $4.6 million, $3.0 million and $453,000 of interest related to major construction in projects in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements (twenty to forty years)
and equipment (three to fifteen years). Depreciation expense was $113.7 million, $96.1 million and $86.8 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Long-Lived Assets:

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of,” and APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the Results
of Operations—Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.” The Statement does not change the fundamental provisions of SFAS No. 121; however,
it resolves various implementation issues of SFAS No. 121 and establishes a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale. It retains the requirement of Opinion No. 30 to report separately discontinued operations, and
extends that reporting for all periods presented to a component of an entity that, subsequent to or on January 1, 2002, either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale. Additionally, SFAS No. 144 requires that assets and liabilities of
components held for sale, if material, be disclosed separately in the balance sheet.

If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset to be held and used may be impaired, management estimates the undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the
asset. If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash
flows using appropriate discount rates.

Goodwill:

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002, and accordingly, ceased amortizing goodwill as of that date. As required by SFAS No. 142, the Company performed an impairment test on
goodwill as of January 1, 2002, which indicated no impairment of goodwill. Management has designated September 1st as the Company’s annual impairment assessment date and performed its impairment assessment as of September 1, 2002,
which indicated no impairment of goodwill.



The following
table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share on a pro-forma basis assuming that SFAS No. 142 was adopted on January 1, 2000:

For the
year ended December 31, 2001, adjusted income before extraordinary charge would have been $116,350, adjusted income before extraordinary charge per basic share would have been $1.94 and adjusted income before extraordinary charge per diluted share
would have been $1.85.

Changes in the carrying
amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2002 were as follows (in thousands):

(A)

Consists of the foreign currency translation adjustment on goodwill recorded in connection with the Company’s acquisition of an 80% ownership interest in an
operating company that owns nine acute care facilities in France.

Other Assets:

During 1994, the Company established an employee life insurance program covering approximately 2,200 employees. The cash surrender value of the policies
($15.8 million at December 31, 2002 and $15.9 million at December 31, 2001) was recorded net of related loans ($15.7 million at December 31, 2002 and $15.8 million at December 31, 2001) and is included in other assets.

Included in other assets are estimates of expected recoveries
from various state guaranty funds in connection with PHICO related professional and general liability claims payments amounting to $37.0 million and $54.0 million at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. Actual recoveries may
vary from these estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates (See Note 8). Other assets at December 31, 2001 also include $70 million of deposits on acquisitions, which were consummated on January 1, 2002.

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, other
intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were not material.



Self-Insured Risks:

The Company provides for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers’ compensation claims, based on estimates of the ultimate costs for
both reported claims and claims incurred by not reported.

The ultimate costs of such claims, which include costs associated with litigating or settling claims, are accrued when the incidents that give rise to the claims occur. Estimated losses from asserted and unasserted claims are
accrued, based on Management’s estimates of the ultimate costs of the claims and the relationship of past reported incidents to eventual claims payments. All relevant information, including the Company’s own historical experience, the
nature and extent of existing asserted claims, and reported incidents, and independent actuarial analyses of this information, is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. The accrual also includes an estimate of the losses that will result
from unreported incidents, which are probable of having occurred before the end of the reporting period.

In addition, the Company also maintains self-insured employee benefits programs for healthcare and dental claims. The ultimate costs
related to these programs includes expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.

Estimated losses are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at
each reporting date. The amounts of the changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.

Income Taxes:

Deferred taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as
a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.

Other Noncurrent Liabilities:

Other noncurrent liabilities include the long-term portion of the
Company’s professional and general liability, workers’ compensation reserves and pension liability.

Minority Interest:

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the $134.3 million and $126.0 million, respectively,
minority interest consists primarily of a 27.5% outside ownership interest in three acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada, a 20% outside ownership interest in an acute care facility located in Washington, DC and a 20% outside ownership
interest in an operating company that owns nine hospitals in France.

Comprehensive Income:

Comprehensive income or loss is recorded in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income”. SFAS No.130 establishes standards for
reporting comprehensive income and its components in financial statements. Comprehensive income (loss), is comprised of net income, changes in unrealized gains or losses on derivative financial instruments, foreign currency translation adjustments
and the minimum pension liability.

Accounting
for Derivative Financial Investments and Hedging Activities:

The Company manages its ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate. To manage this risk
in a cost-effective manner, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements, in which it agrees to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company began accounting for
its derivative and hedging activities using SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet. For derivative transactions designated as hedges, the Company formally documents all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its
risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset



or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) within shareholders’
equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.

The Company uses interest rate swaps in its cash flow hedge transactions. The interest rate swaps are designed to be highly effective in
offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income
statement.

Derivative instruments designated in
a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges under SFAS 133. Fair value hedges are
accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item in the income statement.

For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge’s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a
formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly
effective in the future.

Foreign
Currency:

One of the Company’s subsidiaries operates in France, whose currency is denominated in Euros. The French subsidiary translates its assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates in
effect at the end of the fiscal period. Any resulting gains or losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying balance sheet.

The revenue and expense accounts of the France subsidiary are translated into U.S. dollars at the average
exchange rate that prevailed during the period. Therefore, the U.S. dollar value of the French subsidiary’s operating results may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in exchange rates.

Stock-Based Compensation:

At
December 31, 2002, the Company has a number of stock-based employee compensation plans, which are more fully described in Note 5. The Company accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related Interpretations. No compensation cost is reflected in net income for most stock option grants, as all options granted under the plan had an original exercise price equal to the market
value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation,” to stock-based employee compensation. The Company recognizes compensation cost related to restricted share awards over the respective vesting periods, using an accelerated method.



For the year
ended December 31, 2001, net income before extraordinary charge would have been $100,750, earnings per basic share before extraordinary charge would have been $1.68 on an as reported basis and $1.54 on a proforma basis and earnings per diluted share
before extraordinary charge would have been $1.62 on an as reported basis and $1.50 on a proforma basis.

Earnings per Share:

Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year adjusted to give effect to common stock equivalents.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
diluted earnings per share, after the $1.0 million after-tax extraordinary charge recorded in 2001 (effect on basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.01 and $0.02, respectively), for the periods indicated:

For the
year ended December 31, 2001, net income before extraordinary charge would have been $100,750, earnings per basic share before extraordinary charge would have been $1.68 and earnings per diluted share before extraordinary charge would have been
$1.62.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments:

The fair values of the Company’s registered debt, interest rate swap agreements and investments are based on quoted market prices. The fair values of other long-term debt, including capital lease
obligations, are estimated by discounting cash flows using period-end interest rates and market conditions for instruments with similar maturities and credit quality. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, and short-term borrowings approximates their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the fair value disclosures included elsewhere in these notes to
consolidated financial statements.

Use of
Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications:

Certain prior
period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.



New
Accounting Pronouncements:

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”. The Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and associated asset retirement costs. The Statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The asset retirement
obligations will be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. The Statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and
normal operation of long-lived assets. The Statement is effective January 1, 2003 for the Company, with earlier adoption permitted. Management does not believe that this Statement will have a material effect on the Company’s financial
statements.

In April, 2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 145, which rescinds SFAS No. 4 “Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt”, SFAS No. 44, “Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers, and SFAS No. 64, “Extinguishment of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking Fund
Requirements” (SFAS 145). SFAS No. 145 also amends SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases” to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to
sale-leaseback transactions. Any gain or loss that does not meet the criteria in APB Opinion 30 for classification as an extraordinary item shall be reclassified. This provision will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2003. Except for
the possible reclassification of the extraordinary charge on early extinguishment of debt recorded in 2001, Management does not believe that this Statement will have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit of Disposal Activities.” The Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 94-3, “Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring).” The Statement generally requires that a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. The Statement is effective for all exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, with earlier application encouraged. Management
does not believe that this Statement will have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees;
including Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” This interpretation requires that a liability must be recognized at the inception of a guarantee issued or modified after December 31, 2002 whether or not payment under the guarantee is probable.
For guarantees entered into prior to December 31, 2002, the interpretation requires certain information related to the guarantees be disclosed in the guarantor’s financial statements. The disclosure requirements of this interpretation are
effective for the year ended December 31, 2002 and are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure, an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 123”. This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements. Certain of the disclosure modifications are
required for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and are included in the notes to these consolidated financial statements.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No.
51.” This Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements”, addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities. This Interpretation applies immediately to variable
interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or



interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired
before February 1, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, the Company does not have any unconsolidated variable interest entities.

2) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES


— Subsequent to December 31, 2002, the Company spent $39.9 million to acquire the assets and operations of: (i) a 108-bed
behavioral health system in Anchorage, Alaska, and; (ii) two hospitals located in France that were purchased by an operating company which is 80% owned by the Company.


— During 2002, the Company spent $3 million to acquire a majority ownership interest in the
assets and operations of a surgery center located in Puerto Rico. In addition, effective January 1, 2002, the Company acquired the assets and operations of: (i) a 150-bed acute care facility located in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, and; (ii) a 117-bed
acute care facility located in Lancaster, California. Included in other assets at December 31, 2001 were $70 million of deposits related to the acquisition of these two facilities.

The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated on a preliminary basis to assets and
liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows:

The pro
forma effect of these acquisitions on the Company’s net revenues, net income and basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were immaterial. During 2002, the Company received net proceeds of $8.4 million
resulting from the sale of real estate related to a women’s hospital and a radiation oncology center, both of which were closed in a prior year and written down to their estimated net realizable values. The sale of the real estate of the
women’s hospital resulted in a $2.2 million gain. The gain on the sale of the radiation center did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

2001 —

During 2001, the Company spent $263 million to acquire the assets and operations of: (i) a
108-bed behavioral health care facility located in San Juan Capestrano, Puerto Rico; (ii) a 96-bed acute care facility located in Murrieta, California; (iii) two behavioral health care facilities located in Boston, Massachusetts; (iv) a 60-bed
specialty heart hospital located in McAllen, Texas; (v) an 80% ownership interest in an operating company that owns nine hospitals located in France; (vi) two ambulatory surgery centers located in Nevada and Louisiana; (vii) a 150-bed acute care
facility located in Lansdale, Pennsylvania (ownership effective January 1, 2002), and; (viii) a 117-bed acute care facility located in Lancaster, California (ownership effective January 1, 2002).



The aggregate
net purchase price of the facilities was allocated on a preliminary basis to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows:

The
increase of $9 million in other working capital accounts at acquired facilities from their date of acquisition through December 31, 2001 consisted of the following:

The pro
forma effect of these acquisitions on the Company’s net revenues, net income and basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2001, was immaterial, as the majority of the acquisitions occurred early in 2001. Assuming the
2001 acquisitions had been completed as of January 1, 2000, the unaudited pro forma net revenues and net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 would have been approximately $2.4 billion and $100.7 million, respectively, and the unaudited pro
forma basic and diluted earnings per share would have been $1.67 and $1.62, respectively.


— During 2000, the Company spent $141 million to acquire the assets and operations of: (i) a 277-bed acute care facility located in Enid, Oklahoma; (ii) 12 behavioral health care
facilities located in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi, Utah and Texas; (iii) a 77-bed acute care facility located in Eagle Pass, Texas, and; (iv) the operations of a behavioral health care facility
in Texas. In connection with the acquisition of the facility in Eagle Pass, Texas, the Company agreed to construct a new 100-bed facility scheduled to be completed and opened by the fourth quarter of 2006.

The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was
allocated on a preliminary basis to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows:



The increases
of $24.2 million in other working capital accounts at acquired facilities from their date of acquisition through December 31, 2000 consisted of the following:

Assuming
the 2000 acquisitions had been completed as of January 1, 2000, the unaudited pro forma net revenues and net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 would have been approximately $2.4 billion and $100.4 million, respectively and the unaudited
pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share would have been $1.67 and $1.62, respectively.

During 2000, the Company sold the real property of a behavioral health care facility located in Florida and its ownership interests in a women’s hospital and two physician practices located in
Oklahoma for net proceeds of approximately $5.5 million. In addition, the Company sold a medical office building located in Nevada to a limited liability company that is majority owned by Universal Health Realty Income Trust (see Note 9). The net
gain/loss from these transactions was not material.

The goodwill acquired during the last three years as presented above, is expected to be fully deductible for income tax purposes.

3)    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair Value Hedges:

The Company has two floating rate swaps having a notional principal amount of $60 million
in which the Company receives a fixed rate of 6.75% and pays a floating rate equal to 6 month LIBOR plus a spread. The term of these swaps is ten years and they are both scheduled to expire on November 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2002, the average
floating rate on these swaps was 2.68%. During 2002 the Company recorded an increase of $8.0 million in other assets to recognize the fair value of these swaps and an $8.0 million increase in long term debt to recognize the difference between the
carrying value and fair value of the related hedged liability.

Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, the Company recorded an adjustment to increase other assets and long-term debt by $3.3 million to recognize the fair value of an interest rate swap that was designated as a
fair-value hedge and to recognize the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the related hedged liability. During the third quarter of 2001, the counter-party to this interest rate swap, which had a notional principal amount of $135
million, elected to terminate the interest rate swap. This swap had been designated as a fair value hedge of the Company’s $135 million 8.75% Senior Notes that were redeemed in October, 2001. The termination resulted in a net payment to the
Company of approximately $3.8 million. Upon the termination of the fair value hedge, the Company ceased adjusting the fair value of the debt. The effective interest method was used to amortize the resulting difference between the fair value at
termination and the face amount of the debt through the maturity date of the Senior Notes. In connection with the redemption of the Senior Notes in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss on debt extinguishment of
$1.6 million.

Cash Flow
Hedges:

As of December 31, 2002, the Company has one fixed rate swap with a notional principal amount of $125 million which expires in August 2005. The Company pays a fixed rate of 6.76% and receives a floating rate equal
to three month LIBOR. As of December 31, 2002, the floating rate of this interest rate swap was 1.40%.



As of December
31, 2002, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company had two interest rate swaps denominated in Euros. These two interest rate swaps are for a total notional amount of 41.2 million Euros ($40.9 million based on the end of period currency exchange
rate). The notional amount decreases to 35.0 million Euros ($34.8 million) on December 30, 2003, 27.5 million Euros, ($27.3 million) on December 30, 2004 and the swaps mature on June 30, 2005. The Company pays an average fixed rate of 4.35% and
receives six month EURIBOR. The effective floating rate for these swaps as of December 31, 2002 was 2.87%.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), pre-tax losses
of $6.4 million ($4.1 million after-tax) to recognize the change in fair value of all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. The gains or losses are reclassified into earnings as the underlying hedged item affects
earnings, such as when the forecasted interest payment occurs. Assuming market rates remain unchanged from December 31, 2002, it is expected that $7.2 million of pre-tax net losses in accumulated OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the
next twelve months. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company also recorded a charge to earnings of $169,000 ($107,000 after-tax) during the year to recognize the ineffective portion of its cash flow hedging instruments. As of December
31, 2002, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions is through August, 2005.

Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, the Company recorded the cumulative effect of an
accounting change of approximately $7.6 million ($4.8 million after-tax) in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to recognize the fair value all derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedging instruments. During the year ended
December 31, 2001, the Company recorded, in AOCI, a pre-tax charge of $2.4 million ($1.5 million after-tax) to recognize the change in fair value of all derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedging instruments. During the year ended
December 31, 2001, the Company also recorded a charge to earnings of approximately $300,000 ($200,000 after-tax) to recognize the ineffective portion of its cash flow hedging instruments.

The Company had a fixed rate swap having a notional principal amount of $135 million whereby the Company paid
a fixed rate of 6.76% and received a floating rate from the counter-party. During 2001, the notional amount of this swap was reduced to $125 million. The Company had two interest rate swaps to fix the rate of interest on a total notional principal
amount of $75 million with a scheduled maturity date of August, 2005 that were terminated in November, 2001. The average fixed rate on the $75 million of interest rate swaps, included the Company’s borrowing spread of .35%, was 7.05%. The total
cost of all swaps terminated in 2001 was $7.4 million. This amount was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss due to the probability of the original forecasted interest payments not occurring.

Foreign Currency Risk:

In
connection with the Company’s purchase of a 80% ownership interest in an operating company that owns hospitals in France in the first quarter of 2001, the Company extended an intercompany loan denominated in francs. During the first quarter of
2001, the Company recorded a $1.3 million pre-tax loss ($800,000 after-tax), resulting from foreign exchange fluctuations related to this intercompany loan. During the second quarter of 2001, the Company entered into certain forward exchange
contracts to hedge the exposure associated with foreign currency fluctuations on the intercompany loan. These contracts, which are now expired, were not designated as hedging instruments and changes in the fair value of these items were recorded in
earnings to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses of the intercompany loan. The effect of the change in fair value of the contract for the year ended December 31, 2001 was a loss of $200,000 which offset a $200,000 exchange gain on the
intercompany loan.



4)    LONG-TERM DEBT

A summary of long-term debt follows:

The
Company has a $400 million unsecured non-amortizing revolving credit agreement, which expires on December 13, 2006. The agreement includes a $50 million sublimit for letters of credit of which $29 million was available at December 31, 2002. The
interest rate on borrowings is determined at the Company’s option at the prime rate, certificate of deposit rate plus .925% to 1.275%, Euro-dollar plus .80% to 1.150% or a money market rate. A facility fee ranging from .20% to .35% is required
on the total commitment. The margins over the certificate of deposit, the Euro-dollar rates and the facility fee are based upon the Company’s leverage ratio. At December 31, 2002, the applicable margins over the certificate of deposit and the
Euro-dollar rate were 1.125% and 1.00%, respectively, and the commitment fee was .25 %. There are no compensating balance requirements. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $349 million of unused borrowing capacity available under the revolving
credit agreement.

During 2002, a majority-owned
subsidiary of the Company entered into a senior credit agreement denominated in Euros amounting to 45.8 million Euros ($44.9 million based on the end of period currency exchange rate.) The loan, which is non-recourse to the Company, amortizes to
zero over the life of the agreement and matures on December 31, 2007. Interest on the loan is at the option of the Company’s majority-owned subsidiary and can be based on the one, two three and six month EURIBOR plus a spread of 2.5%. As of
December 31, 2002, the interest rate was 5.4% and the effective interest rate including the effects of the designated interest rate swaps was 6.9%.

The Company also has a $100 million commercial paper credit facility.

The majority of the Company’s acute care patient
accounts receivable are pledged as collateral to secure this commercial paper program. A commitment fee of .40% is required on the used portion and .20% on the unused portion of the commitment. This annually renewable program, which began in
November 1993, is scheduled to expire or be renewed in October of each year. Outstanding amounts of commercial paper which can be refinanced through available borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit agreement are classified as
long-term. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had no unused borrowing capacity under the terms of the commercial paper facility.



During 2001,
the Company issued $200 million of Senior Notes which have a 6.75% coupon rate and which mature on November 15, 2011. (“Notes”). The interest on the Notes is paid semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The notes
can be redeemed in whole at any time and in part from time to time.

The Company issued discounted Convertible Debentures in 2000 which are due in 2020 (“Debentures”). The aggregate issue price of the Debentures was $250 million or $587 million aggregate principal amount at
maturity. The Debentures were issued at a price of $425.90 per $1,000 principal amount of Debenture. The Debentures’ yield to maturity is 5% per annum, .426% of which is cash interest. The interest on the bonds is paid semiannually in arrears
on June 23 and December 23 of each year. The Debentures are convertible at the option of the holders into 5.6024 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 of Debentures, however, the Company has the right to redeem the Debenture any time
on or after June 23, 2006 at a price equal to the issue price of the Debentures plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest to the date of redemption.

The average amounts outstanding during 2002, 2001 and 2000 under the revolving credit and demand notes and
commercial paper program were $140.3 million, $220.0 million and $170.0 million. respectively, with corresponding effective interest rates of 3.3%, 5.1% and 7.4% including commitment and facility fees. The maximum amounts outstanding at any
month-end were, $170 million in 2002, $343.9 million in 2001 and $270.9 million in 2000.

The effective interest rate on the Company’s revolving credit, demand notes and commercial paper program, including the respective interest expense and income incurred on existing and now expired
designated interest rate swaps, was 6.3%, 6.4% and 7.1% during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Additional interest (expense)/income recorded as a result of the Company’s U.S. dollar denominated hedging activity was ($4,228,000) in 2002,
($2,730,000) in 2001 and $414,000 in 2000. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counter-party to the interest rate swap agreements. All of the counter-parties are creditworthy financial institutions rated AA
or better by Moody’s Investor Service and the Company does not anticipate non-performance. The estimated fair value of the cost to the Company to terminate the interest rate swap obligations including the Euro denominated interest rate swaps,
at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was approximately $10.4 million and $11.7 million, respectively.

Covenants relating to long-term debt require maintenance of a minimum net worth, specified debt to total capital and fixed charge coverage ratios. The Company is in compliance with all required
covenants as of December 31, 2002.

The fair
value of the Company’s long-term debt at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was approximately $791.1 million and $751.5 million, respectively.



Aggregate
maturities follow:

Included
in the aggregate maturities shown above, are maturities related to the Company’s Euro denominated debt ($45.4 million in the aggregate) which mature as follows: $4.5 million in 2003; $6.1 million in 2004; $7.6 million in 2005; $9.1 million in
2006; $9.1 million in 2007 and $9.0 million in later years.

5)    COMMON STOCK

In April, 2001, the Company declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend which was paid on June 1, 2001 to shareholders of record as of May 16, 2001. All classes of common stock participated on a pro rata
basis and all references to share quantities and earnings per share for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.

During 1998 and 1999, the Company’s Board of Directors approved stock purchase programs authorizing the Company to purchase up to
twelve million shares of its outstanding Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. Pursuant to the terms of these programs, the Company purchased 2,408,000 shares at an average
purchase price of $14.95 per share ($36.0 million in the aggregate) during 2000, 178,057 shares at an average purchase price of $43.33 per share ($7.7 million in the aggregate) during 2001 and 1,713,787 shares at an average purchase price of $44.71
per share ($76.6 million in the aggregate) during 2002. Since inception of the stock purchase program in 1998 through December 31, 2002, the Company purchased a total of 9,517,602 shares at an average purchase price of $22.74 per share ($216.4
million in the aggregate).

At December 31, 2002,
17,584,459 shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock, for issuance upon conversion of the
Company’s discounted Convertible Debentures and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans. Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock.

As discussed in Note 1, the Company accounts for stock-based
compensation using the intrinsic value method in APB No. 25, as permitted under SFAS No. 123. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following range of assumptions
used for the fifteen option grants that occurred during 2002, 2001 and 2000:



Stock options
to purchase Class B Common Stock have been granted to officers, key employees and directors of the Company under various plans.

Information with respect to these options is summarized as follows:

Outstanding Options at December 31, 2002:

All
stock options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of the grant. Options are exercisable ratably over a four-year period beginning one year after the date of the grant. The options expire five years after
the date of the grant. The outstanding stock options at December 31, 2002 have an average remaining contractual life of 2.5 years. At December 31, 2002, options for 2,054,614 shares were available for grant. At December 31, 2002, options for
1,393,143 shares of Class B Common Stock with an aggregate purchase price of $36.9 million (average of $26.48 per share) were exercisable.

During the third quarter of 2002, the Company restructured certain elements of its long-term incentive compensation plans in response to
recent changes in regulations relating to such plans. Prior to the third quarter of 2002, the Company loaned employees funds (“Loan Program”) to pay the income tax liabilities incurred upon the exercise of their stock options. Advances
pursuant to the Loan Program were secured by full recourse promissory notes that were forgiven after three years, if the borrower remained employed by the Company. If the forgiveness criteria were not met, the employee was required to repay the loan
at the time of separation.

During the third
quarter of 2002, this Loan Program was terminated. As a replacement long-term incentive plan, the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors approved the issuance of 575,997 shares (net of cancellations) of restricted stock at
$51.15 per share ($29.5 million in the aggregate) to various officers and employees pursuant to the Company’s 2001 Employees’ Restricted Stock Purchase Plan (“Restricted Stock”). The number of shares and the current value of the
Restricted Stock issued to each employee were based on the estimated benefits lost by that employee as a result of the termination of the Loan Program. The Restricted



Stock is scheduled to vest ratably on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary dates of the award. Included in the Restricted Stock granted
was 319,490 restricted shares issued to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) which are also scheduled to vest ratably on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary dates of the award. However, subject to stockholder approval of
certain amendments to the Restricted Stock Purchase Plan, the shares issued to the Company’s CEO will be awarded only if the Company achieves a 14% cumulative increase in earnings during the two-year period ending December 31, 2004, as compared
to the year ended December 31, 2002.

In
connection with the Loan Program, it was the Company’s policy to charge compensation expense for the loan forgiveness over the employees’ estimated service period or approximately six years on average. As of December 31, 2002, the Company
had approximately $18 million of loans outstanding in connection with the Loan Program (approximately $13 million of which was loaned to officers of the Company), of which approximately $15 million was charged to compensation expense through that
date. The balance will be charged to compensation expense over the remaining service periods (through March, 2007), assuming the forgiveness criteria are met. In addition, as of July 1, 2002, the Company had recorded an additional accrual of
approximately $16.0 million related to the estimated benefits earned under the Loan Program for which loans had not yet been extended. As a result of the termination of the Loan Program, this accrued liability was adjusted by reducing compensation
expense by $16.0 million during 2002 (the majority of which was recorded during the third quarter of 2002) since the Company does not have any future obligations related to the benefits that employees might have been entitled to if the Loan Program
had continued.

Since the Restricted Stock awards
were primarily intended to replace the benefits that had been earned under the Loan Program, a portion of the awards was attributable to services rendered by employees in prior periods. Accordingly, in connection with the issuance of the Restricted
Stock awards during 2002, during the third quarter of 2002 the Company recorded approximately $14.1 million of compensation expense which represented the prior service portion of the expense related to the Restricted Stock awards. During the fourth
quarter of 2002, an additional $1.2 million of compensation expense was recorded related to the Restricted Stock awards. The remaining expense associated with the Restricted Stock awards (estimated at $14.2 million as of December 31, 2002, but
subject to adjustment based on the market value of the shares granted to the Company’s CEO) will be recorded over the vesting periods of the awards (through the third quarter of 2007), assuming the recipients remain employed by the Company.

In addition to the stock option plan the Company
has the following stock incentive and purchase plans: (i) a Stock Compensation Plan which expires in November, 2004 under which Class B Common Shares may be granted to key employees, consultants and independent contractors (officers and directors
are ineligible); (ii) a Stock Ownership Plan whereby eligible employees (officers of the Company are no longer eligible) may purchase shares of Class B Common Stock directly from the Company at current market value and the Company will loan each
eligible employee 90% of the purchase price for the shares, subject to certain limitations, (loans are partially recourse to the employees); (iii) a 2001 Restricted Stock Purchase Plan which allows eligible participants to purchase shares of Class B
Common Stock at par value, subject to certain restrictions (575,997 shares issued during 2002), and; (iv) a Stock Purchase Plan which allows eligible employees to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock at a ten percent discount. The Company has
reserved 3.4 million shares of Class B Common Stock for issuance under these various plans (excluding terminated plans) and has issued 1.6 million shares pursuant to the terms of these plans (excluding terminated plans) as of December 31, 2002, of
which 38,432, 3,542 and 54,076 became fully vested during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

In connection with the long-term incentive plans described above, the Company recorded net compensation expense of $3.6 million in 2002, $12.6 million in 2001 and $6.8 million in 2000.



6) INCOME TAXES

Components of income taxes are as follows:

The
Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” (SFAS 109). Under SFAS 109, deferred taxes are required to be classified based on the financial
statement classification of the related assets and liabilities which give rise to temporary differences. Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
The components of deferred taxes are as follows:

A
reconciliation between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate is as follows:



The net
deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised as follows:

The
assets and liabilities classified as current relate primarily to the allowance for uncollectible patient accounts and the current portion of the temporary differences related to self-insurance reserves. Under SFAS 109, a valuation allowance is
required when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more
likely than not that all the deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, the Company has not provided a valuation allowance. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced if estimates of future taxable
income during the carry-forward period are reduced.

7)    LEASE COMMITMENTS

Certain of the Company’s hospital and medical office facilities and equipment are held under operating or capital leases which expire through 2008 (See Note 9). Certain of these leases also contain provisions allowing
the Company to purchase the leased assets during the term or at the expiration of the lease at fair market value.

A summary of property under capital lease follows:



Future minimum
rental payments under lease commitments with a term of more than one year as of December 31, 2002, are as follows:

Capital
lease obligations of $9.5 million in 2002, $10.6 million in 2001 and $1.9 million in 2000 were incurred when the Company entered into capital leases for new equipment or assumed capital lease obligations upon the acquisition of facilities.

8)    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Due to unfavorable pricing and availability
trends in the professional and general liability insurance markets, the Company’s subsidiaries have assumed a greater portion of the hospital professional and general liability risk as the cost of commercial professional and general liability
insurance coverage has risen significantly. As a result, effective January 1, 2002, most of the Company’s subsidiaries were self-insured for malpractice exposure up to $25 million per occurrence. The Company, on behalf of its subsidiaries,
purchased an umbrella excess policy through a commercial insurance carrier for coverage in excess of $25 million per occurrence with a $75 million aggregate limitation. Total insurance expense including professional and general liability, property,
auto and workers’ compensation, was approximately $25 million higher in 2002 as compared to 2001. Given these insurance market conditions, there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in claims
asserted against the Company, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future results of operations.

For the period from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2001, most of the Company’s subsidiaries were covered under professional and
general liability insurance policies with PHICO, a Pennsylvania-based commercial insurance company. Certain subsidiaries, including hospitals located in Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and south Texas were covered under policies with various coverage
limits up to $5 million per occurrence through December 31, 2001. The majority of the remaining subsidiaries were covered under policies, which provided for a self-insured retention limit up to $1 million per occurrence, with an annual aggregate
retention amount of approximately $4 million in 1998, $5 million in 1999, $7 million in 2000 and $11 million in 2001. These subsidiaries maintain excess coverage up to $100 million with other major insurance carriers.

Early in the first quarter of 2002, PHICO was placed in
liquidation by the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a $40 million pre-tax charge to earnings to accrue for its estimated liability that resulted from this event. Management
estimated this liability based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of
unasserted claims based on historical experience, and estimated recoveries from state guaranty funds.



When PHICO
entered liquidation proceedings, each state’s department of insurance was required to declare PHICO as insolvent or impaired. That designation effectively triggers coverage under the applicable state’s insurance guarantee association,
which operates as replacement coverage, subject to the terms, conditions and limits set forth in that particular state. Therefore, the Company is entitled to receive reimbursement from those state’s guarantee funds for which it meets the
eligibility requirements. In addition, the Company may be entitled to receive reimbursement from PHICO’s estate for a portion of the claims ultimately paid by the Company. Management expects that the remaining cash payments related to these
claims will be made over the next seven years as the cases are settled or adjudicated.

Included in other assets as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, were estimates of approximately $37 million and $54 million, respectively, representing expected recoveries from various state
guaranty funds. The reduction in estimated recoveries as of December 31, 2002 as compared to December 31, 2001 is due to Management’s reassessment of its ultimate liability for general and professional liability claims relating to the period
from 1998 through 2001, its estimate of related recoveries under state guaranty funds, and payments received during 2002 from such state guaranty funds. While Management continues to monitor the factors used in making these estimates, the
Company’s ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims and its actual recoveries from state guaranty funds, could change materially from current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates.
Therefore, there can be no assurance that changes in these estimates, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.

As of December 31, 2002, the total accrual for the
Company’s professional and general liability claims, including all PHICO related claims was $168.2 million ($131.2 million net of expected recoveries from state guaranty funds), of which $12.0 million is included in other current liabilities.
As of December 31, 2001, the total reserve for the Company’s professional and general liability claims was $158.1 million ($104.1 million net of expected recoveries from state guaranty funds), of which $26.0 million is included in other current
liabilities.

As of December 31, 2002, the
Company has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling $28.4 million consisting of: (i) $22.5 million related to the Company’s self-insurance programs, and; (ii) $5.9 million consisting primarily of collateral for outstanding bonds
of an unaffiliated party and public utilities.

The Company entered into a long-term contract with a third party, that expires in 2012, to provide certain data processing services for its acute care and behavioral health facilities.

During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recognized a
pre-tax charge of $7.7 million to reflect the amount of an unfavorable jury verdict and reserve for future legal costs relating to an unprofitable facility that was closed during the first quarter of 2001. During 2001, an appellate court issued an
opinion affirming the jury verdict and during the first quarter of 2002, the Company filed a petition for review by the Texas Supreme Court, which has accepted the case for review. Pending the outcome of the state supreme court review, the Company
recorded interest expense related to this unfavorable jury verdict in the amount of $700,000 in both 2002 and 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2002, as a result of the sale of the real estate of this facility, the Company recorded a pre-tax $2.2
million gain.

In addition, various suits and
claims arising in the ordinary course of business are pending against the Company. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

The healthcare industry is subject
to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and
abuse. Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers. Providers that are found to have
violated these



laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to fines or penalties or required to
repay amounts received from government for previously billed patient services. While management of the Company believes its policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that the Company will not
be subjected to governmental inquiries or actions.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) was enacted in August, 1996 to assure health insurance portability, reduce healthcare fraud and abuse, guarantee security and privacy of health information
and enforce standards for health information. Organizations are required to be in compliance with certain HIPAA provisions beginning in April, 2003. Provisions not yet finalized are required to be implemented two years after the effective date of
the regulation. Organizations are subject to significant fines and penalties if found not to be compliant with the provisions outlined in the regulations. The Company is in the process of implementation of the necessary changes required pursuant to
the terms of HIPAA. The Company expects that the implementation cost of the HIPAA related modifications will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

9)    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

At December 31, 2002, the Company held approximately 6.6% of
the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the “Trust”). The Company serves as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement. Pursuant to the terms of this advisory agreement, the Company conducts
the Trust’s day to day affairs, provides administrative services and presents investment opportunities. In addition, certain officers and directors of the Company are also officers and/or directors of the Trust. Management believes that it has
the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore the Company accounts for its investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting. The Company’s pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $1.4 million during
2002, $1.3 million during 2001 and $1.2 million during 2000, and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The carrying value of this investment was $9.1 million and $9.0 million at December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The market value of this investment was $20.3 million at December 31, 2002 and $18.0 million at December 31, 2001.

As of December 31, 2002, the Company leased six hospital
facilities from the Trust with terms expiring in 2004 through 2008. These leases contain up to six 5-year renewal options. During 2002, the Company exercised the five-year renewal option on an acute care hospital leased from the Trust which was
scheduled to expire in 2003. The renewal rate on this facility is based upon the five year Treasury rate on March 29, 2003 plus a spread. Future minimum lease payments to the Trust are included in Note 7. Total rent expense under these operating
leases was $17.2 million in 2002, $16.5 million in 2001 and $17.1 million in 2000. The terms of the lease provide that in the event the Company discontinues operations at the leased facility for more than one year, the Company is obligated to offer
a substitute property. If the Trust does not accept the substitute property offered, the Company is obligated to purchase the leased facility back from the Trust at a price equal to the greater of its then fair market value or the original purchase
price paid by the Trust. As of December 31, 2002, the aggregate fair market value of the Company’s facilities leased from the Trust is not known, however, the aggregate original purchase price paid by the Trust for these properties was $112.5
million. The Company received an advisory fee from the Trust of $1.4 million in 2002 and $1.3 million in both 2001 and 2000 for investment and administrative services provided under a contractual agreement which is included in net revenues in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income.

During 2000, the Company sold the real property of a medical office building to limited liability company that is majority owned by the Trust for cash proceeds of approximately $10.5 million. Tenants in the multi-tenant building
include subsidiaries of the Company as well as unrelated parties.



In connection
with a long-term incentive compensation plan that was terminated during the third quarter of 2002, the Company had $18 million as of December 31, 2002 and $21 million as of December 31, 2001, of gross loans outstanding to various employees of which
$15 million as of December 31, 2002 and $18 million as of December 31, 2001 were charged to compensation expense through that date. Included in the amounts outstanding were gross loans to officers of the Company amounting to $13 million as of
December 31, 2002 and $16 million as of December 31, 2001 (see Note 5).

The Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is member of the Board of Directors of Broadlane, Inc. In addition, the Company and certain members of executive management own approximately 6% of the outstanding
shares of Broadlane, Inc. as of December 31, 2002. Broadlane, Inc. provides contracting and other supply chain services to various healthcare organizations, including the Company.

A member of the Company’s Board of Directors and member of the Executive Committee is Of Counsel to the
law firm used by the Company as its principal outside counsel. This Board member is also the trustee of certain trusts for the benefit of the Chief Executive Officer and his family. This law firm also provides personal legal services to the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer. Another member of the Company’s Board of Directors and member of the Board’s Executive and Audit Committees was formerly Senior Vice Chairman and Managing Director of the investment banking firm used
by the Company as one of its Initial Purchasers for the Convertible Debentures issued in 2000.

10)    PENSION PLAN

The Company maintains contributory and non-contributory retirement plans for eligible employees. The Company’s contributions to the contributory plan amounted to $7.2 million, $6.2 million and
$4.7 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The non-contributory plan is a defined benefit pension plan which covers employees of one of the Company’s subsidiaries. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee’s
highest compensation for any five years of employment. The Company’s funding policy is to contribute annually at least the minimum amount that should be funded in accordance with the provisions of ERISA.



The following
table shows reconciliations of the defined benefit pension plan for the Company as of December 31, 2002 and 2001:

The
projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the pension plan with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $61,627, $56,584 and $42,918, respectively as of December 31, 2002.
The fair value of plan assets, comprised of approximately 70% equities and 30% fixed income securities, exceeded the accumulated benefit obligations of the plan, as of December 31, 2001. As a result of a reduction in the expected long-term rate of
return to 8% and reduction of the discount rate to 6.75% for 2003, the Company’s pension expense is estimated to increase by approximately $3 million as compared to 2002.



11)    SEGMENT REPORTING

The Company’s reportable operating segments consist of acute care services and behavioral health care services. The “Other” segment column below includes centralized services including information services,
purchasing, reimbursement, accounting, taxation, legal, advertising, design and construction, and patient accounting as well as the operating results for the Company’s other operating entities including outpatient surgery and radiation centers
and an 80% ownership interest in an operating company that owns nine hospitals located in France. The Company’s France subsidiary is included on the basis of the year ended November 30

th

. The chief operating decision making group for the Company’s acute care services and behavioral health care services located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico
is comprised of the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, and the lead executives of each of the Company’s two primary operating segments. The lead executive for each operating segment also manages the profitability of each
respective segment’s various hospitals. The acute care and behavioral health services’ operating segments are managed separately because each operating segment represents a business unit that offers different types of healthcare services.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company adopted SFAS Nos. 142 and 144, effective
January 1, 2002. There was no impact on the segment data presented as a result of the adoption of these pronouncements.



(a)

Operating income is defined as net revenues less salaries, wages & benefits, other operating expenses, supplies expense and provision for doubtful accounts.
Below is a reconciliation of consolidated operating income to consolidated net income before income taxes and extraordinary charge:

12)    QUARTERLY RESULTS

The following tables summarize the Company’s quarterly financial data for the two years ended December 31, 2002:



Net revenues
in 2002 include $33.0 million of additional revenues received from Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) funds in Texas and South Carolina. Of this amount, $8.4 million was recorded in the first quarter, $8.8 million in the
second quarter, $7.0 million in the third quarter and $8.8 million in the fourth quarter. These amounts were recorded in periods that the Company met all of the requirements to be entitled to these reimbursements. Failure to renew these programs
beyond their scheduled termination dates (June 30, 2003 for South Carolina and August 31, 2003 for Texas), failure to qualify for DSH funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s future results of operations. Included in the Company’s results during the fourth quarter of 2002 is a $2.2 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the real estate of a hospital that was closed in 2001 ($.02 per diluted share
after-tax).

Net
