PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

Our principal business is owning and operating, through our
subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers. As of February 26, 2015, we owned and/or operated 24 acute care hospitals and 216 behavioral health
centers located in 37 states, Washington, D.C., the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As part of our ambulatory treatment centers division, we manage and/or own outright or in partnerships with physicians, 5 surgical hospitals
and surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 4 states.

Net revenues from our acute care hospitals, surgical hospitals, surgery
centers and radiation oncology centers accounted for 51% of our consolidated net revenues in 2014, 49% in 2013 and 50% in 2012. Net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities accounted for 49% of our consolidated net revenues in 2014 and
50% during each of 2013 and 2012.

Services provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine,
obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services. We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our
facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.

2014 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity:

Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses:

During 2014, we spent approximately $431 million to: (i) acquire the stock of Cygnet Health Care Limited which consists of 17 facilities
located throughout the United Kingdom including 15 inpatient behavioral health hospitals and 2 nursing homes with a total of 723 beds (during the third quarter); (ii) acquire and fund the required capital reserves related to Prominence Health
Plan, a commercial health insurer headquartered in Reno, Nevada (during the second quarter); (iii) acquire the Psychiatric Institute of Washington (“PIW”), a 124-bed behavioral health care facility and outpatient treatment center
located in Washington, D.C. (during the second quarter); (iv) acquire the operations of Palo Verde Behavioral Health, a 48-bed behavioral health facility in Tucson, Arizona; (v) acquire the real property of The Bridgeway, a 103-bed
behavioral health care facility located in North Little Rock, Arkansas, that was previously leased from Universal Health Realty Income Trust; (vi) acquire the previously leased real property of Cygnet Hospital-Harrow, a 44-bed behavioral health
care facility, the operations of which were acquired by us as part of the Cygnet Health Care Limited acquisition, and; (vii) acquire physician practices. As part of the acquisition of PIW, we also acquired the Arbor Group, L.L.C., which
operates three facilities pursuant to management contracts covering 66 beds in the Washington, D.C. and Maryland market.

Acquisition:

In February, 2015, we acquired the Orchard Portman House Hospital (now called Cygnet Hospital-Taunton), a 46-bed
behavioral health care facility located near Taunton, United Kingdom.

Divestitures:

During 2014, we received approximately $15 million of cash proceeds for the divestiture of a non-operating investment sold during the first
quarter of 2014 and the real property of a closed behavioral health facility sold during the second quarter of 2014. In connection with these transactions, our 2014 consolidated results of operations included a net pre-tax gain of $8 million.

Our Mission

Our mission and objective is to provide superior healthcare services that patients recommend to families and friends, physicians prefer for
their patients, purchasers select for their clients, employees are proud of, and investors seek for long-term results. To achieve this, we have a commitment to:

•

service excellence

•

continuous improvement in measurable ways

•

employee development

•

ethical and fair treatment

•

teamwork

•

compassion

•

innovation in service delivery

Business Strategy

We believe community-based hospitals will remain the focal point of the healthcare delivery network and we are committed to a philosophy of
self-determination for both the company and our hospitals.

Acquisition of Additional Hospitals.

We selectively seek
opportunities to expand our base of operations by acquiring, constructing or leasing additional hospital facilities. We are committed to a program of rational growth around our core businesses, while retaining the missions of the hospitals we manage
and the communities we serve. Such expansion may provide us with access to new markets and new healthcare delivery capabilities. We also continue to examine our facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities that we believe do not have the
potential to contribute to our growth or operating strategy.



Improvement of Operations of Existing Hospitals and Services.

We also seek to
increase the operating revenues and profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services, improvement of existing services, physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls.

We are involved in continual development activities for the benefit of our existing facilities. From time to time applications are filed with
state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals in states which require certificates of need, or CONs. Although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our
operations, no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in these efforts.

Quality and Efficiency of
Services.

Pressures to contain healthcare costs and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible. We are
responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services. In addition, in response to cost containment pressures, we continue to implement programs at our facilities designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while
continuing to provide quality care, including more efficient use of professional and paraprofessional staff, monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage, improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more
efficient billing and collection procedures. In addition, we will continue to emphasize innovation in our response to the rapid changes in regulatory trends and market conditions while fulfilling our commitment to patients, physicians, employees,
communities and our stockholders.

In addition, our aggressive recruiting of highly qualified physicians and developing provider networks
help to establish our facilities as an important source of quality healthcare in their respective communities.

Hospital Utilization

We believe that the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital include the quality and market
position of the hospital and the number, quality and specialties of physicians providing patient care within the facility. Generally, we believe that the ability of a hospital to meet the health care needs of its community is determined by its
breadth of services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that affect utilization include general and local economic conditions, market penetration of managed care programs, the
degree of outpatient use, the availability of reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and demographic changes such as the growth in local populations. Utilization across the industry also is being affected by improvements in clinical
practice, medical technology and pharmacology. Current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors. We are also unable to predict the extent to which these
industry trends will continue or accelerate. In addition, hospital operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, such as higher patient volumes and net patient service revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year.

The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for hospitals operated by us for the years indicated. Accordingly, information
related to hospitals acquired during the five-year period has been included from the respective dates of acquisition, and information related to hospitals divested during the five year period has been included up to the respective dates of
divestiture.

“Average Available Beds” is the number of beds which are actually in service at any given time for immediate patient use with the necessary equipment and staff available for patient care. A hospital may have
appropriate licenses for more beds than are in service for a number of reasons, including lack of demand, incomplete construction, and anticipation of future needs

(2)

“Patient Days” is the sum of all patients for the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient.

(3)

“Occupancy Rate” is calculated by dividing average patient days (total patient days divided by the total number of days in the period) by the number of average beds, either available or licensed.

Sources of Revenue

We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare
program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients. See

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Sources of Revenue

for additional
disclosure. Other information related to our revenues, income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements,

Segment Reporting.

Regulation and Other Factors

Overview:

The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to
government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse provisions (including, but not
limited to, federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources, false claims submitted to federal health care programs and self-referrals by physicians). Providers that are found to
have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed
patient services. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions, or that we would not be faced
with sanctions, fines or penalties if so subjected. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us.

Licensing, Certification and Accreditation:

All of our hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local
statutes and regulations and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to



review standards of medical care, equipment and cleanliness. Our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal, state and local health
agencies, as well as the requirements of municipal building codes, health codes and local fire departments. Various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and
operate certain equipment.

All of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by The Joint Commission. All of our acute care hospitals
and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.

If any of our facilities were to lose its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid
programs, the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other payors. We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body
regulations and standards. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services
in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on operations.

Certificates of Need:

Many of the states in which we
operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need (“CON”) laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services. Failure to obtain necessary state approval
can result in our inability to complete an acquisition, expansion or replacement, the imposition of civil or, in some cases, criminal sanctions, the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility’s
license, which could harm our business. In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements. In the
past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.

Conversion Legislation:

Many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of
not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities. These laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general, advance notification and community involvement. In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation
may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions. Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a
not-for-profit entity sells a health care facility to a for-profit entity. The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of
not-for-profit hospitals.

Utilization Review:

Federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by
Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services. The law and regulations require Peer Review Organizations (“PROs”) to review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid
patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of diagnosis related group (“DRG”) classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay. PROs may deny payment for services provided,
assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) that a provider that is in substantial non-compliance with the standards of the PRO be excluded from participating in the Medicare
program. We have contracted with PROs in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews.

Audits:

Most
hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of Medicare and Medicaid program submitted claims. If these audits identify overpayments, we could be required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years’ payments subject to
various administrative appeal rights. The federal government contracts with



third-party “recovery audit contractors” (“RACs”) and “Medicaid integrity contractors” (“MICs”), on a contingent fee basis, to audit the propriety of
payments to Medicare and Medicaid providers. The Recovery Audit Prepayment Review demonstration program will enable RACs to review claims before they are paid to ensure that the provider complied with all Medicare payment rules. Currently, the
demonstration program is targeting states with high populations of fraud- and error-prone providers. Similarly, Medicare zone program integrity contractors (“ZPICs”) target claims for potential fraud and abuse. Additionally, Medicare
administrative contractors (“MACs”) must ensure they pay the right amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”)
announced its intent to consolidate many of these Medicare and Medicaid program integrity functions into new unified program integrity contractors (“UPICs”), though it remains unclear what effect, if any, this proposed consolidation may
have. We have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of federal healthcare payments during the last three years, the results of which have not required material adjustments to our consolidated results of operations. However, potential
liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves, and any excess could potentially be substantial. Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations also provide for withholding Medicare and Medicaid
overpayments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash flow.

Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation

The Stark Law:

The Social Security Act includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” This law
prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception is met. These types of referrals are known as
“self-referrals.” Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include civil penalties up to $15,000 for each violation, up to $100,000 for sham arrangements, up to $10,000 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion
from the federal health care programs. There are a number of exceptions to the self-referral prohibition, including an exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital
department unit, service or subpart. However, federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities. This recent regulation
also places a number of compliance requirements on physician-owned hospitals related to reporting of ownership interest. There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including
employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements.

We monitor all aspects of our
business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Nonetheless, because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, there
can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the Stark Law.

Anti-kickback Statute:

A provision of the Social Security Act known as the “anti-kickback statute” prohibits healthcare
providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using, referring, ordering, recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders
of services or other items covered by a federal or state health care program. However, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation; one is no longer required to “have actual knowledge or specific
intent to commit a violation of” the anti-kickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law.

The anti-kickback statute
contains certain exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) has issued regulations that provide for “safe harbors,” from the federal anti-kickback statute for
various activities. These activities, which must meet certain requirements, include (but are not limited to) the following: investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts,
sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in
group



practices, freestanding surgery centers, donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services. The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does
not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti-kickback statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government
enforcement authorities.

Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to
comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not
violate the anti-kickback statute or other applicable laws. Violations of the anti-kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, however, under 18 U.S.C. Section 3571, this fine may be
increased to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations. Civil money penalties may include fines of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from
participation in Medicare and Medicaid.

Similar State Laws:

Many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that
prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care. These statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well
as loss of licensure. In many instances, the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes. However, in most cases, little precedent exists for the interpretation
or enforcement of these state laws.

These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we don’t have the benefit
of regulatory or judicial interpretation. It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make
changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible
violations of one or more of these laws (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, we
cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.

If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be
subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal
and state health care programs. The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Regulations:

A current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of
the federal False Claims Act, and, in particular, actions being brought by individuals on the government’s behalf under the False Claims Act’s qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions. Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to
bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the Federal government.

When a defendant is
determined by a court of law to have violated the False Claims Act, the defendant may be liable for up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false
claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009
(“FERA”) has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the False Claims Act, eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds. FERA also clarifies that
a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention, as well as the receipt, of overpayments. In addition, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil False Claims Act. Further, a



number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state
court. Recent changes to the False Claims Act require that federal healthcare program overpayments be returned within 60 days from the date the overpayment was identified, or by the date any corresponding cost report was due, whichever is later.
Failure to return an overpayment within this period may result in additional civil False Claims Act liability.

Other Fraud and Abuse
Provisions:

The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, billing for services
without prescribed documentation, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud. Like the anti-kickback statute, these provisions are very broad.

Further, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws
by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs, whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs. HIPAA also introduced enforcement mechanisms to
prevent fraud and abuse in Medicare. There are civil penalties for prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy Requirements:

The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by
the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically.
These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information. The privacy and security regulations address the use
and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed. Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties.

We believe that we are in material compliance with the privacy regulations of HIPAA, as we continue to develop training and revise procedures
to address ongoing compliance. The HIPAA security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of patient information. HITECH has
since strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates, and created new security breach notification requirements. HITECH has also extended
the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a HIPAA violation has occurred. We believe that we have been in substantial compliance with HIPAA and HITECH requirements to date. Recent changes to the HIPAA regulations may
result in greater compliance requirements for healthcare providers, including expanded obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our
behalf.

Red Flags Rule:

In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions
and businesses maintaining accounts to address the risk of identity theft. The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010, signed on December 18, 2010, appears to exclude certain healthcare providers from the Red Flags Rule, but permits the FTC
or relevant agencies to designate additional creditors subject to the Red Flags Rule through future rulemaking if the agencies determine that the person in question maintains accounts subject to foreseeable risk of identity theft. Compliance with
any such future rulemaking may require additional expenditures in the future.

Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005:

On July 29, 2005, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 was enacted, which has the goal of reducing medical errors and increasing patient safety. This legislation establishes a confidential reporting structure in which
providers can voluntarily report “Patient Safety Work Product” (“PSWP”) to “Patient Safety Organizations” (“PSOs”). Under the system, PSWP



is made privileged, confidential and legally protected from disclosure. PSWP does not include medical, discharge or billing records or any other original patient or provider records but does
include information gathered specifically in connection with the reporting of medical errors and improving patient safety. This legislation does not preempt state or federal mandatory disclosure laws concerning information that does not constitute
PSWP. PSOs are certified by the Secretary of the HHS for three-year periods and analyze PSWP, provide feedback to providers and may report non-identifiable PSWP to a database. In addition, PSOs are expected to generate patient safety improvement
strategies.

Environmental Regulations:

Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in
compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. Infectious waste generators, including hospitals, face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste, including civil penalties of up to $25,000 per
day of noncompliance, criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day, imprisonment, and remedial costs. In addition, our operations, as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws, rules and
regulations. We believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws.

Corporate Practice
of Medicine:

Several states, including Florida, Nevada, California and Texas, have laws and/or regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain
direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services. Possible
sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These statutes and/or regulations
vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies. We do not expect these state corporate practice of medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations. Many states have laws
and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and fee-splitting with physicians. We do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements.

EMTALA:

All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”). This
federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under Medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from a
medical emergency, to either stabilize the patient’s condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition. Our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient’s
ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient’s
ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program. In addition to any liabilities that a hospital may incur under EMTALA, an injured patient, the
patient’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that statute.

The federal government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospital’s emergency
room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain
exceptions. EMTALA does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services; however, CMS has recently sought industry comments on the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with
specialized capabilities, respectively. CMS has not yet issued regulations or guidance in response to that request for comments. The government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively in the future. We
believe that we operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.

Health Care Industry Investigations:

We are subject to claims
and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various



government investigations and litigation. Please see

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

included herein for additional disclosure. In addition, currently, and from time to time, some of our
facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies. Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be
excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously
billed patient services.

We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is
designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with
industry practices, including ours. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions, or that we will not be faced with
sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with the investigations. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, the government’s inquiry and/or action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating
results.

Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations. It is
possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executives and/or
managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation and/or named as defendants in private litigation.

Revenue Rulings 98-15 and 2004-51:

In March 1998 and May 2004, the IRS issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of
joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals. As a result of the tax rulings, the IRS has proposed, and may in the future propose, to revoke the tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit entities which
participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them. The tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts regarding the
tax-exempt or public charity status of a not-for-profit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or require the
restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with not-for-profits.

State Rate Review:

Some states where we operate
hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state. In the aggregate, state rate reviews and
indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations.

Medical Malpractice Tort Law Reform:

Medical malpractice tort law has historically been maintained at the state level. All states have laws governing medical liability lawsuits. Over half of the states have limits on damages awards. Almost all states have eliminated joint and several
liability in malpractice lawsuits, and many states have established limits on attorney fees. Many states had bills introduced in their legislative sessions to address medical malpractice tort reform. Proposed solutions include enacting limits on
non-economic damages, malpractice insurance reform, and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates. Reform
legislation has also been proposed, but not adopted, at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area.

Compliance Program:

Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1998. Currently, the program’s elements
include a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs, and a means for enforcing the program’s policies.



Since its initial adoption, the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet
the industry’s expectations and our needs. Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and
operational aspects of our business. Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program. Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing, and cost reports,
comprise the bulk of these areas. Financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, including compliance with anti-kickback and Stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and
training, standardized documentation requirements, and review and audit.

Medical Staff and Employees

Our facilities had approximately 68,700 employees on December 31, 2014, of whom approximately 48,700 were employed full-time. Our
hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals. In a number of our markets, physicians may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours. Within our acute care
division, approximately 160 physicians are employed by physician practice management subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations. Members of the medical staffs of our
hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. In addition, within our behavioral health division, approximately 400 psychiatrists are employed by
subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations. Each of our hospitals is managed on a day-to-day basis by a managing director employed by a subsidiary of ours. In addition, a
Board of Governors, including members of the hospital’s medical staff, governs the medical, professional and ethical practices at each hospital. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.

Approximately 1,750 of our employees at seven of our hospitals are unionized. At Valley Hospital Medical Center, unionized employees belong to
the Culinary Workers and Bartenders Union, the International Union of Operating Engineers and the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”). Nurses and technicians at Desert Springs Hospital are represented by the SEIU and
International Union of Operating Engineers. At The George Washington University Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the SEIU or the Hospital Police Association. At the Psychiatric Institute of Washington, clinical, clerical, support and
maintenance employees are represented by the Communication Workers of America (AFL-CIO). Nurses at Corona Regional Medical Center are represented by the United Nurses Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals (UNAC/UHCP).
Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, certain technicians and therapists, pharmacy assistants, and some clerical employees at HRI Hospital in Boston are represented by the SEIU. At Brooke Glen Behavioral Hospital, unionized employees are
represented by the Teamsters and the Northwestern Nurses Association/Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals. A union representation election was held at Rock River Academy and Residential Center (“RRARC”) in
August, 2014 for the Mental Health Technicians, LPNs, Drivers and Teachers’ Assistants. The results of the election were not determinative, however, and in light of the decision to terminate RRARC’s contract with Illinois Department of
Children and Family Services and close the facility, we are in the process of resolving all outstanding NLRB litigation and fulfilling its statutory obligations to displaced workers under state and federal labor laws.

Competition

The
health care industry is highly competitive. In recent years, competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the United States due to, among other things, regulatory and technological changes, increasing use of managed care
payment systems, cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment. In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals. In addition,
some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sale and income taxes. Such
exemptions and support are not available to us.



In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better
equipped and offer a broader range of services than us. Certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical, surgical and behavioral health services, facilities and equipment
that are not available at our hospitals. The increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities, outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us.

The number and quality of the physicians on a hospital’s staff are important factors in determining a hospital’s success and
competitive advantage. Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment. We believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the
patient’s needs, the quality of other physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospital’s facilities. We strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by
maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel, technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians.

In addition, we depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab
technicians and other health care professionals. We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel. Our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are
experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide, which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate. In addition, in some markets like California,
there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels. To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may by required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net
operating revenues.

Many states in which we operate hospitals have CON laws. The application process for approval of additional covered
services, new facilities, changes in operations and capital expenditures is, therefore, highly competitive in these states. In those states that do not have CON laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable
by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. See “Regulation and Other Factors.”

Our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and
significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals. Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment. In addition, employers and traditional
health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges. In return, hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients.
Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience. The importance
of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations.

A key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets. The competition to
acquire hospitals is significant. We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit health care companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do. We intend to
selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth, but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms.

Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust:

At December 31, 2014, we held approximately 5.9% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the
“Trust”). We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the Trust’s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and



present investment opportunities. In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust. Management believes that it has the ability to exercise
significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting. We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements
of income, of approximately $2.5 million during 2014, $2.4 million during 2013 and $2.1 million during 2012.

Our pre-tax share of income
from the Trust was $3.2 million during 2014, $842,000 during 2013 and $1.2 million during 2012, and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year. Included in our share of the Trust’s income for
2014 and 2012 was approximately $2.3 million in 2014 and $500,000 in 2012 related to our share of the net favorable impact realized by the Trust in connection with: (i) gains on the sale of medical office buildings (in 2012); (ii) gain on
sale of a behavioral health hospital facility (in 2014), and; (iii) gain on fair value recognition resulting from the Trust’s purchase of minority ownership interests in majority owned limited liability companies (in 2014).

The carrying value of our investment in the Trust was $9.3 million and $8.1 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and is
included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The market value of our investment in the Trust was $37.9 million at December 31, 2014 and $31.5 million at December 31, 2013, based on the closing price of the
Trust’s stock on the respective dates.

Total rent expense under the operating leases on the four hospital facilities with the Trust
(as discussed below) was $16.8 million during 2014, $16.4 million during 2013 and $16.3 million during 2012. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by the Trust or by limited liability
companies in which the Trust holds 100% of the ownership interest.

The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain
properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries. Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional
5-year renewal terms. Each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below. The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter
revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year. The leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.

During the third quarter of 2014, we provided notification to the Trust that, upon the December, 2014 expiration of the The Bridgeway’s
lease term, we intended to exercise our option to purchase the real property of the facility. On December 31, 2014, we purchased The Bridgeway’s real property (a 103-bed behavioral health facility located in North Little Rock, Arkansas)
from the Trust. Pursuant to the terms of the lease, we and the Trust were both required to obtain appraisals of the property to determine its fair market value. Based upon the property appraisals obtained by each party, the purchase price of The
Bridgeway’s real property was approximately $17.3 million.

In addition, we recently constructed two free-standing emergency
departments (“FEDs”) located in Weslaco and Mission, Texas which were completed and opened during the first quarter of 2015. The Trust purchased one of these FEDs from us in January, 2015 and the other in February, 2015. In conjunction
with these sales, wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours, which will operate the FEDs, executed agreements with the Trust to lease the properties for initial terms of 10-years with six, 5-year renewal options. The aggregate construction cost/sales
proceeds of these facilities was approximately $12.8 million and the aggregate rent expense paid to the Trust at the commencement of the leases will approximate $900,000 annually.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

We are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, many of
which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not
aware of, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, could also impact our business and results of operations.

A significant
portion of our revenue is produced by facilities located in Texas, Nevada and California.

Texas:

We own 7 acute care
hospitals and 22 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in

Item 2. Properties

. On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 18% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2014, 2013 and 2012. On a combined basis, after deducting
an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 17% in 2014, 15% in 2013, and 12% in 2012 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.

Nevada:

We own 6 acute care hospitals and 4 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in

Item 2. Properties.

On a combined
basis, these facilities contributed 16% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2014, 2013 and 2012. On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 11% in 2014, 6% in 2013, and
8% in 2012 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.

California:

We own 5 acute care
hospitals and 6 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in

Item 2. Properties

. On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 10% in 2014, 9% in 2013, and 10% in 2012 of our consolidated net revenues. On a combined basis, after
deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 8% in 2014, 4% in 2013, and 6% in 2012 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.

The significant portion of our revenues and earnings derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to legislative, regulatory,
economic, environmental and competition changes in Texas Nevada and California. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect
on our overall business results.

Our revenues and results of operations are significantly affected by payments received from the
government and other third party payors.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from third-party payors, including the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. Changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and, in some cases, reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare services. Payments from federal and state
government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase
or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities. We are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations. In addition, the
uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of, among other things, the substantial deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding requirements from the federal healthcare reform legislation,
may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, the vast majority of the net revenues generated at our behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom are derived from governmental payors. If
the rates paid or the scope of services covered by governmental payors in the United States or United Kingdom are reduced, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.



We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of Texas, Washington,
D.C., Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Nevada, Virginia and Florida, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those
states. Based upon the state budgets for those states for the 2015 fiscal year (which generally began at various times during the second half of 2014), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates were relatively unchanged from
the 2014 fiscal year rates.

In addition to changes in government reimbursement programs, our ability to negotiate favorable contracts
with private payors, including managed care providers, significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals. Private payors, including managed care providers, increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment.

We expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls. Reductions in reimbursement
amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.

Reductions or changes in Medicare funding could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

On January 3, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the “2012 Act”). The 2012 Act
postponed for two months sequestration cuts mandated under the Budget Control Act of 2011. The postponed sequestration cuts include a 2% annual reduction over ten years in Medicare spending to providers. Medicaid is exempt from sequestration. In
order to offset the costs of the legislation, the 2012 Act reduces payments to other providers totaling almost $26 billion over ten years. Approximately half of those funds will come from reductions in Medicare reimbursement to hospitals. Although
the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 has reduced certain sequestration-related budgetary cuts, spending reductions related to the Medicare program remain in place. On December 26, 2013, President Obama signed into law H.J. Res. 59, the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2013, which includes the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 (“the Act”). In addition, on February 15, 2014, Public Law 113-082 was enacted. The Act and subsequent federal legislation achieves new savings by
extending sequestration for mandatory programs—including Medicare—for another three years, through 2024. Please see

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Sources of
Revenue-Medicare

, for additional disclosure.

The 2012 Act includes a document and coding (“DCI”) adjustment and a reduction
in Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) payments. Expected to save $10.5 billion over 10 years, the DCI adjustment decreases projected Medicare hospital payments for inpatient and overnight care through a downward adjustment in
annual base payment increases. These reductions are meant to recoup what Medicare authorities consider to be “overpayments” to hospitals that occurred as a result of the transition to Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups. The
reduction in Medicaid DSH payments is expected to save $4.2 billion over 10 years. This provision extends the changes regarding DSH payments established by the Legislation and determines future allotments off of the rebased level.

We are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform.

On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”). The Healthcare
and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “Reconciliation Act”), which contains a number of amendments to the PPACA, was signed into law on March 30, 2010. Two primary goals of the PPACA, combined with the Reconciliation Act
(collectively referred to as the “Legislation”), are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.

Although it is expected that as a result of the Legislation there may be a reduction in uninsured patients, which should reduce our expense
from uncollectible accounts receivable, the Legislation makes a number of



other changes to Medicare and Medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us. It has been projected that the Legislation will result in a net reduction in Medicare and Medicaid
payments to hospitals totaling $155 billion over 10 years. The Legislation revises reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties
under these programs to achieve these goals. The Legislation provides for decreases in the annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the market basket update beginning October 1, 2011 for
Medicare Part B reimbursable items and services and beginning October 1, 2012 for Medicare inpatient hospital services. The Legislation and subsequent revisions provide for reductions to both Medicare DSH and Medicaid DSH payments. The Medicare
DSH reductions began in October, 2013 with no material adverse impact to the reimbursements we receive expected until 2015 while Medicaid DSH reimbursements would not be adversely impacted until 2016. The Legislation implements a value-based
purchasing program, which will reward the delivery of efficient care. Conversely, certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters; such hospitals will include those with excessive readmission or
hospital-acquired condition rates.

A 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling limited the federal government’s ability to expand health
insurance coverage by holding unconstitutional sections of the Legislation that sought to withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain Medicaid coverage requirements. Pursuant to that decision, the federal government may not
penalize states that choose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion program by reducing their existing Medicaid funding. Therefore, states can choose to accept or not to participate without risking the loss of federal Medicaid funding. As a
result, many states, including Texas, have not expanded their Medicaid programs without the threat of loss of federal funding.

There have
been several attempts in Congress to repeal or modify various provisions of the PPACA. We cannot predict whether or not any of these proposed changes to the PPACA will become law and therefore can provide no assurance that changes to the PPACA, as
currently implemented, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

In addition, a case currently pending
before The Supreme Court of the United States,

King vs. Burwell

, challenges the federal government’s ability to subsidize premiums paid by certain eligible individuals that obtain health insurance policies through federally facilitated
exchanges. A number of our hospitals operate in states that utilize federally facilitated exchanges. The Supreme Court of the United States’ decision in this case could result in an increased number of uninsured patients treated at our
hospitals located in these states which would have an adverse effect on our future results of operations.

The various provisions in the
Legislation that directly or indirectly affect Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are scheduled to take effect over a number of years. The impact of the Legislation on healthcare providers will be subject to implementing regulations, interpretive
guidance and possible future legislation or legal challenges. Certain Legislation provisions, such as those creating the Medicare Shared Savings Program and the Independent Payment Advisory Board, create uncertainty in how healthcare may be
reimbursed by federal programs in the future. Thus, we cannot predict the impact of the Legislation on our future reimbursement at this time and we can provide no assurance that the Legislation will not have a material adverse effect on our future
results of operations.

The Legislation also contained provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare. The Legislation amends
several existing laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers. While Congress had previously
revised the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person is not required to “have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of” the Anti-Kickback Statute in order to be found in violation of such
law, the Legislation also provides that any claims for items or services that violate the Anti-Kickback Statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The Legislation provides that a healthcare provider
that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil False Claims Act, although final regulations implementing this statutory



requirement remain pending. The Legislation also expands the Recovery Audit Contractor program to Medicaid. These amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on
healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations.

We have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of
our facilities. These investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self-referral law. The Legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a “grandfather” clause if the arrangement
satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital. The Legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing
physician-owned hospitals and restricts the ability of physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities.

The impact
of the Legislation on each of our hospitals may vary. Because Legislation provisions are effective at various times over the next several years, we anticipate that many of the provisions in the Legislation may be subject to further revision. We
cannot predict the impact the Legislation may have on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity, or whether we will be able to successfully adapt to the changes required by the Legislation.

We are required to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay.

In accordance with our internal policies and procedures, as well as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, we provide
a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor and/or seeking medical treatment (whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay) to
determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition. If it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition, we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patient’s
medical condition, within the facility’s capability, or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the treating hospital’s written procedures. Our obligations under EMTALA may
increase substantially going forward; CMS has sought stakeholder comments concerning the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively, but has yet to issue
further guidance in response to that request. If the number of indigent and charity care patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly, or if regulations expanding our obligations to inpatients under EMTALA is proposed
and adopted, our results of operations will be harmed.

If we are not able to provide high quality medical care at a reasonable
price, patients may choose to receive their health care from our competitors.

In recent years, the number of quality measures that
hospitals are required to report publicly has increased. CMS publishes performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals submit in connection with the Medicare program. Federal law provides for the
future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported. Additionally, the Legislation requires all hospitals to annually establish, update and make public a list of their standard charges for products and services. If any of our
hospitals achieve poor results on the quality measures or patient satisfaction surveys (or results that are lower than our competitors) or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, our patient volume could decline because patients may
elect to use competing hospitals or other health care providers that have better metrics and pricing. This circumstance could harm our business and results of operations.

An increase in uninsured and underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the
accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations.

Collection of receivables from third-party payors and patients is
our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill that is the patient’s responsibility, which primarily includes co-payments and
deductibles. However, we also have substantial receivables due to us as of December 31, 2014 (a significant portion of which is past due) from



certain state-based funding programs, most particularly Illinois and Texas as discussed herein. We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix, the
agings of the receivables, historical collection experience and assessment of probability of future collections. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately
affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted. Significant changes in business office operations, payor mix, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage
could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flow and results of operations. If we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses, our results of operations will be harmed.

Our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.

The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals, and other healthcare providers for patients and physicians has
intensified in recent years. In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals. Some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by
tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sales and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to us.

In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services
than we. The number of inpatient facilities, as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers, many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians, in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly. As a result, most
of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment.

If our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit
physicians and other healthcare professionals, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities, we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed.

Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.

Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment. As a result,
the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends, in part, on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations with those
physicians. Physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals, and, in a number of our markets, physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. They may terminate their affiliation with us at any time. If
we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards, adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our
facilities and our results of operations may decline.

It may become difficult for us to attract and retain an adequate number of
physicians to practice in certain of the non-urban communities in which our hospitals are located. Our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to attract patients
to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Generally, the top ten attending physicians within each of our facilities represent a large share of our inpatient revenues and admissions.
The loss of one or more of these physicians, even if temporary, could cause a material reduction in our revenues, which could take significant time to replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and retaining physicians.



If we do not continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances
in diagnostic and surgical equipment, our ability to maintain and expand our markets will be adversely affected.

The technology
used in medical equipment and related devices is constantly evolving and, as a result, manufacturers and distributors continue to offer new and upgraded products to health care providers. To compete effectively, we must continually assess our
equipment needs and upgrade when significant technological advances occur. If our facilities do not stay current with technological advances in the health care industry, patients may seek treatment from other providers and/or physicians may refer
their patients to alternate sources, which could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business.

If we fail to
continue to meet the meaningful use criteria related to electronic health record systems (“EHR”), our operations could be harmed.

Pursuant to HITECH regulations, hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update
to the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. We believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject
to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015. However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a
market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year. Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.

Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for
staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations.

We depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience
of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other healthcare professionals. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other
medical personnel.

The nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us
and other healthcare providers. This shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel. In addition, in some markets like
California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels. To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets, which would have a corresponding adverse effect
on our net operating revenues.

We cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting
and retaining talented medical support staff. If our general labor and related expenses increase, we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly. Our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical
support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations.

Increased labor union activity is another factor that
could adversely affect our labor costs. Union organizing activities and certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization in the future, to the extent a greater portion of our
employee base unionized, it is possible our labor costs could increase materially.

If we fail to comply with extensive laws and
government regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability.

The healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels
relating to, among other things: hospital billing practices and prices for services; relationships with physicians and other referral sources; adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services; ownership of facilities;
qualifications of medical and support personnel;



confidentiality, maintenance, privacy and security issues associated with health-related information and patient medical records; the screening, stabilization and transfer of patients who have
emergency medical conditions; certification, licensure and accreditation of our facilities; operating policies and procedures, and; construction or expansion of facilities and services.

Among these laws are the federal False Claims Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (“HIPAA”), the
federal anti-kickback statute and the provision of the Social Security Act commonly known as the “Stark Law.” These laws, and particularly the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, impact the relationships that we may have with
physicians and other referral sources. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities, including employment contracts, leases and professional service agreements. We also provide financial
incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals. The Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has enacted safe harbor regulations that
outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti-kickback statute. A number of our current arrangements, including financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources, may not qualify for safe harbor
protection under the anti-kickback statute. Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti-kickback statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. We cannot assure that practices that
are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti-kickback statute. CMS published a Medicare self-referral disclosure protocol, which is intended to allow providers to self-disclose actual or potential violations of the Stark law.
Because there are only a few judicial decisions interpreting the Stark law, there can be no assurance that our hospitals will not be found in violation of the Stark Law or that self-disclosure of a potential violation would result in reduced
penalties.

Federal regulations issued under HIPAA contain provisions that require us to implement and, in the future, may require us to
implement additional costly electronic media security systems and to adopt new business practices designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patient’s health and related financial information. Such privacy and security
regulations impose extensive administrative, physical and technical requirements on us, restrict our use and disclosure of certain patient health and financial information, provide patients with rights with respect to their health information and
require us to enter into contracts extending many of the privacy and security regulatory requirements to third parties that perform duties on our behalf. Additionally, recent changes to HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance
requirements, including obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.

These laws and regulations are extremely complex, and, in many cases, we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation. In
the future, it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities,
equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws (see

Item 3—Legal Proceedings

), or the public announcement that we are being
investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, we cannot
predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be. See

Item 1 Business—Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback
Legislation

.

If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and
regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare,
Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign
jurisdictions and, as a result, are subject to certain U.S. and foreign



laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act regulates U.S. companies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes
and similar practices, and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls. In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities
that affect the United Kingdom.

We are subject to occupational health, safety and other similar regulations and failure to comply
with such regulations could harm our business and results of operations.

We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and
local occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Regulatory requirements affecting us include, but are not limited to, those covering: (i) air and water quality control; (ii) occupational health and safety (e.g., standards
regarding blood-borne pathogens and ergonomics, etc.); (iii) waste management; (iv) the handling of asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and radioactive substances; and (v) other hazardous materials. If we fail to comply with those
standards, we may be subject to sanctions and penalties that could harm our business and results of operations.

We may be subject
to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities.

We are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits, product liability
lawsuits, class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business. Some of these actions may involve large claims, as well as significant defense costs. We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that
findings in such lawsuits may have on us. In an effort to resolve one or more of these matters, we may choose to negotiate a settlement. Amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material. All professional and general liability insurance
we purchase is subject to policy limitations. We believe that, based on our past experience and actuarial estimates, our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals. While we continuously
monitor our coverage, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates. If such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future, or payments of claims
exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

We may be
subject to governmental investigations, regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits.

The federal False Claims Act permits
private parties to bring qui tam, or whistleblower, lawsuits against companies. Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. These
private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years. Because qui tam lawsuits are
filed under seal, we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware. Please see

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

for disclosure of current related matters.

The failure of certain employers, or the closure of certain facilities, could have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals.

The economies in the non-urban communities in which our hospitals operate are often dependent on a small number of large
employers. Those employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals and other health care facilities for their care. The failure of one or more large
employer or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at facilities located in or near the communities where our hospitals operate, could cause affected employees to move elsewhere to seek employment or lose
insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them. The occurrence of these events could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations, thereby harming our business.



If any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new
facilities fail to receive accreditation, such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid.

The construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation relating to, among other
things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection. Additionally, such facilities are subject to periodic
inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards.

All of our hospitals are deemed
certified, meaning that they are accredited, properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the Medicare program. The effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. We believe that all of our healthcare facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local and other relevant regulations and standards. However, should any of our healthcare facilities lose
their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected.

Our growth strategy depends, in part, on acquisitions, and we may not be able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our target
criteria. We may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from not-for-profit entities due to regulatory scrutiny.

Acquisitions
of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy. We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit healthcare companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities. Some of our competitors have
greater resources than we do. Also, suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms.

In addition, many states have
enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that affect the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities. These laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification and community
involvement. In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over such transactions. Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to
provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a healthcare facility to a for-profit entity. The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation, increased review of
not-for-profit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals, increase our acquisition costs or make it difficult for us to acquire
hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria, any of which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations.

Further, the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations, depending on various factors, including
the amount paid for the acquisition, the acquired hospital’s results of operations, allocation of the purchase price, effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases.

We may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire, which could harm our results of operations and adversely
affect our growth strategy.

We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing
operations. We may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals. Integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business, negatively affect cash flow
and distract management and other key personnel. In addition, acquisition activity requires transitions from, and the integration of, operations and, usually, information systems that are used by acquired hospitals. In addition, some of the
hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition. If we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire, operate such hospitals profitably or
effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals, our results of operations could be harmed.



If we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities, we could become liable for
material obligations.

Hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to,
liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Although we typically attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters,
we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of hospitals we acquire. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs and/or resulting damage to a facility’s
reputation could harm our business.

Our subsidiaries, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental
investigations and regulatory actions.

Our subsidiaries, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions,
governmental investigations and regulatory actions (see

Item 3-Legal Proceedings

). In addition, we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events,
circumstances and occurrences. Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of our legal proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if successful claims and other actions are brought against us in the future, there could be a material adverse
impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity following the merger and our ability to achieve expected benefits of the merger.

In particular, government investigations, as well as qui tam lawsuits, may lead to material fines, penalties, damages payments or other
sanctions, including exclusion from government healthcare programs. Settlements of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate integrity agreements, each of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.

State efforts to regulate the
construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand.

Many of the states in which we operate
hospitals have enacted Certificates of Need, or CON, laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services. Our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result
in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition, expansion or replacement, make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, result in the revocation of a facility’s license or impose
civil or criminal penalties on us, any of which could harm our business.

In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a
number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements. In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot
predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.

Controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues.

Controls imposed by third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as
“utilization review,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. Inpatient utilization, average
lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill
patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. Although we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and
fees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.



Our revenues and volume trends may be adversely affected by certain factors over which we
have no control.

Our revenues and volume trends are dependent on many factors, including physicians’ clinical decisions and
availability, payor programs shifting to a more outpatient-based environment, whether or not certain services are offered, seasonal and severe weather conditions, including the effects of extreme low temperatures, hurricanes and tornados,
earthquakes, current local economic and demographic changes. In addition, technological developments and pharmaceutical improvements may reduce the demand for healthcare services or the profitability of the services we offer.

A worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States could materially affect our business and future results of
operations.

Our patient volumes, revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health
insurance, which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets. Worsening of economic conditions may result in a higher unemployment rate which may increase the number of individuals without health insurance.
As a result, our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes, particularly in less intense, more elective service lines, or an increase in services provided to uninsured patients. These factors could have a material unfavorable impact on
our future patient volumes, revenues and operating results.

In addition, as of December 31, 2014, we had approximately
$3.29 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Should the revenues and financial results of our acute care and/or behavioral health care facilities be materially, unfavorably impacted due to, among other things, a
worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States that could negatively impact our patient volumes and reimbursement rates, a continued rise in the unemployment rate and continued increases in the number of uninsured patients
treated at our facilities, we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

Fluctuations in our operating results, quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in decreases in the price of our common
stock.

The stock markets have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to operating performance. These broad market
fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and, as a result, there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock. If we are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past or
as our stockholders expect us to in the future, the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when it becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized.

In addition to our operating results, many economic and seasonal factors outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of
our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings. These factors include certain of the risks discussed herein, demographic changes, operating results of other hospital companies, changes in our financial estimates or
recommendations of securities analysts, speculation in the press or investment community, the possible effects of war, terrorist and other hostilities, adverse weather conditions, the level of seasonal illnesses, managed care contract negotiations
and terminations, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, or other developments affecting the health care industry.

Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

We are exposed to currency exchange risk with respect to the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Pound sterling, because a portion of our
revenue and expenses are denominated in Pounds. We monitor changes in our exposure to exchange rate risk. While we may elect to enter into hedging arrangements to protect our business against certain currency fluctuations, these hedging arrangements
do not provide comprehensive protection, and our results of operations could be adversely affected by foreign exchange fluctuations.



We are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to
comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price.

As a publicly traded
company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate
governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations. For example,
we cannot provide assurance that, in the future, our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We also
cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered
public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year. If we fail to
comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation. If we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our stock price could
decline.

A cyber security incident could cause a violation of HIPAA, breach of member privacy, or other negative impacts.

We rely extensively on our information technology (“IT”) systems to manage clinical and financial data, communicate with
our patients, payors, vendors and other third parties and summarize and analyze operating results. In addition, we have made significant investments in technology to adopt and utilize electronic health records and to become meaningful users of
health information technology pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. A cyber-attack that bypasses our IT security systems causing an IT security breach, loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy
laws, loss of proprietary business information, or a material disruption of our IT business systems, could have a material adverse impact on our business and result of operations. In addition, our future results of operations, as well as our
reputation, could be adversely impacted by theft, destruction, loss, or misappropriation of public health information, other confidential data or proprietary business information.

Different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
condition.

Generally accepted accounting principles are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation
by us, our independent registered public accounting firm and the SEC. Such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances. Differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting
principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

We continue to see rising costs
in construction materials and labor. Such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects.

The cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased. As we continue to invest in modern technologies, emergency rooms and
operating room expansions, the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care, we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds. Although we
evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital, such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues to rise significantly or the
expected patient volumes are not attained.



The deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources
of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed.

We
require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation, expansion, construction and addition of medical equipment and technology. We believe that our capital
expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We cannot predict, however, whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed, which
could harm our business.

To fund all or a portion of our future financing needs, we rely on borrowings from various sources including
fixed rate, long-term debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program. If any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which
could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, global capital markets have
experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding. In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on
acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

We depend heavily on key management personnel and the departure of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our
local hospital management personnel could harm our business.

The expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of
our local hospital management personnel are critical to the success of our business. The loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or of a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could significantly
undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient, quality healthcare services at our facilities, which could harm our business.

The number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock is subject to potential increases or decreases.

At December 31, 2014, 23.3 million shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of
Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans. Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share
basis into Class B Common Stock. To the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of Class B Common Stock, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock available for trading in the public market place would increase
substantially and the current holders of Class B Common Stock would own a smaller percentage of that class.

In addition, from
time-to-time our Board of Directors approve stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. Such repurchases
decrease the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock. Conversely, as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business, we may from time-to-time issue equity through the sale of stock which would
increase the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock. Based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the market price of our stock, interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash, repurchase or issuance of our
stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings per share.



The right to elect the majority of our Board of Directors and the majority of the general
shareholder voting power resides with the holders of Class A and C Common Stock, the majority of which is owned by Alan B. Miller, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors.

Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, with respect to the election of directors, holders of Class A Common Stock vote
as a class with the holders of Class C Common Stock, and holders of Class B Common Stock vote as a class with holders of Class D Common Stock, with holders of all classes of our Common Stock entitled to one vote per share.

As of March 24, 2014, the shares of Class A and Class C Common Stock constituted 7.4% of the aggregate outstanding shares of our
Common Stock, had the right to elect five members of the Board of Directors and constituted 86.7% of our general voting power. As of March 24, 2014, the shares of Class B and Class D Common Stock (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of
options) constituted 92.6% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect two members of the Board of Directors and constituted 13.3% of our general voting power.

As to matters other than the election of directors, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that holders of Class A, Class B,
Class C and Class D Common Stock all vote together as a single class, except as otherwise provided by law.

Each share of Class A
Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote; each share of Class B Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one-tenth of a vote; each share of Class C Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to 100 votes (provided the holder of Class C
Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that holder holds); and each share of Class D Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes (provided the
holder of Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class D Common Stock that holder holds).

In the event a holder of Class C or Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, less
than ten times the number of shares of Class C or Class D Common Stock that holder holds, then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of Class C Common Stock, or one-tenth of a vote for every share of Class D Common Stock,
which that holder holds in excess of one-tenth the number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, held by that holder. The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory evidence
that such owner holds ten times as many shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock as Class C or Class D Common Stock, respectively, if such facts are not apparent from our stock records.

Since a substantial majority of the Class A shares and Class C shares are controlled by Mr. Alan B. Miller and members of his
family who are also directors and officers of our company, and they can elect a majority of our company’s directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders, there are
potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of our company.

In addition, because this concentrated control could
discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, our business and prospects and the trading price of our securities could be adversely
affected.

2013 and $53 million in 2012.

ITEM 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary
course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to litigation, as outlined below.

Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) and Other Government Investigations

In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of
Justice (“DOJ”) advising of a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (“ICDs”) from 2003 to 2010 at several of our acute care facilities. The
DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a National Coverage Determination regarding these devices. We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In February, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena requesting various documents from January, 2008 to the
date of the subpoena directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. (“UHS”) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and several UHS owned behavioral health facilities including: Keys of Carolina, Old Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows
Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a, The Pines Residential Treatment Center, including the
Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health. Prior to receiving this subpoena: (i) the Keys of Carolina and Old Vineyard received notification during the second half of 2012 from the
United States Department of Justice of its intent to proceed with an investigation following requests for documents for the period of January, 2007 to the date of the subpoenas from the North Carolina state Attorney General’s Office;
(ii) Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center received a subpoena in December, 2012 from the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Virginia requesting various documents from July, 2006 to the date of the subpoena, and; (iii) The Meadows
Psychiatric Center received a subpoena from the OIG in February, 2013 requesting certain documents from 2008 to the date of the subpoena. Unrelated to these matters, the Keys of Carolina was closed and the real property was sold in January, 2013. We
were advised that a qui tam action had been filed against Roxbury Treatment Center but the government declined to intervene and the case was dismissed.

In April, 2013, the OIG served facility specific subpoenas on Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting various
documents from January, 2005 to the date of the subpoenas. In July, 2013, another subpoena was issued to Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting additional records. In October, 2013, we were advised by the DOJ’s
Criminal Frauds Section that they received a referral from the DOJ Civil Division and opened an investigation of River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center. Subsequent subpoenas have since been issued to River Point Behavioral Health
and Wekiva Springs Center requesting additional documentation. In April, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) instituted a Medicare payment suspension at River Point Behavioral Health in accordance with federal
regulations which implemented provisions of the Affordable Care Act regarding suspension of payments during certain investigations. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration subsequently issued a Medicaid payment suspension for the facility.
River Point Behavioral Health submitted a rebuttal statement disputing the basis of the suspension and requesting revocation of the suspension. In response, CMS has continued the payment suspension. River Point Behavioral Health has provided
additional information to CMS in an effort to obtain relief from the payment suspension but the suspension remains in effect. In August 2014, we received notification from CMS that, effective September, 2014, the payment suspension was to be
continued for another 180 days. We cannot predict if and/or when the facility’s suspended payments will resume. However, if



continued for a significant period of time, the payment suspension will likely have a material adverse effect on River Point Behavioral Health’s future results of operations and financial
condition. The operating results of River Point Behavioral Health did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013.

In June, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena on Coastal Harbor Health System in Savannah, Georgia requesting documents from January, 2009 to
the date of the subpoena.

In February, 2014, we were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds Section had been
expanded to include the National Deaf Academy. In March, 2014, a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) was served on the National Deaf Academy requesting documents and information from the facility from January 1, 2008 through the date
of the CID. We have been advised by the government that the National Deaf Academy has been added to the facilities which are the subject of the coordinated investigation referenced above.

In March, 2014, CIDs were served on Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Streamwood Behavioral Health requesting documents and
information from those facilities from January, 2008 through the date of the CID.

In September, 2014, the DOJ Civil Division advised us
that they were expanding their investigation to include four additional facilities and were requesting production of documents from these facilities. These facilities are Arbour-HRI Hospital, Behavioral Hospital of Bellaire, St. Simons by the Sea,
and Turning Point Care Center.

In December 2014, the DOJ Civil Division requested that Salt Lake Behavioral Health produce documents
responsive to the original subpoenas issued in February, 2013.

The DOJ has advised us that the civil aspect of the coordinated
investigation in connection with the behavioral health facilities named above is a False Claim Act investigation focused on billings submitted to government payers in relation to services provided at those facilities. At present, we are uncertain as
to potential liability and/or financial exposure of the Company and/or named facilities, if any, in connection with these matters.

Matters Relating to Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (“PSI”):

The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of PSI) which were in existence prior to the acquisition
of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010:

Department of
Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:

In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from
the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility. The requested documents were collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination. Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July, 2011 requesting additional documents, which have
also been delivered to the DOJ. All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI’s ownership prior to our acquisition. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the
investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.

Department of
Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital:

In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ
requesting certain information from the facility. Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010. The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ. All documents requested and produced pertained to the
operations of the facility while under PSI’s ownership prior to our acquisition. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in
connection with this matter.



General:

The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare
participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations
concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers. Currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of
potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies. Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to
potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to payment suspension, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. We monitor all
aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving,
governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no
assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such
inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.

The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or
internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities. We
record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts
accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages
sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in
dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes. It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial
position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.

In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of
business are pending. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Stock Repurchase Programs

In various prior years, our Board of Directors has approved stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our outstanding
Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. During July, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program whereby, from time to time as conditions allow, we
may spend up to $400 million to purchase shares of our Class B Common Stock on the open market or in negotiated private transactions. There is no expiration date for our stock repurchase programs. Upon approval of the new stock repurchase program,
our previously announced stock repurchase program was cancelled. The following schedule provides information related to our stock repurchase program for the three months ended December 31, 2014. All of the shares repurchased during the fourth
quarter of 2014 related to income tax withholding obligations resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock grants, or shares repurchased pursuant to our publicly announced stock repurchase program.

ITEM 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Our
principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers. As of February 26, 2015, we owned and/or
operated 24 acute care hospitals and 216 behavioral health centers located in 37 states, Washington, D.C., the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As part of our ambulatory treatment centers division, we manage and/or own
outright or in partnerships with physicians, 5 surgical hospitals and surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 4 states.

In late
September, 2014, we acquired the stock of Cygnet Health Care Limited. Through this acquisition, we have added a total of 17 facilities located throughout the United Kingdom including 15 inpatient behavioral health hospitals and 2 nursing homes with
a total of 723 beds.

Net revenues from our acute care hospitals, surgical hospitals, surgery centers and radiation oncology centers
accounted for 51% of our consolidated net revenues in 2014, 49% in 2013 and 50% in 2012. Net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities accounted for 49% of our consolidated net revenues in 2014 and 50% during each of 2013 and 2012.

Services provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology,
oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services. We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information
services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors

You should carefully review the information contained in this Annual Report, and should particularly consider any risk factors that we set
forth in this Annual Report and in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). In this Annual Report, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial
performance. This Annual Report contains “forward-looking statements” that reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities. Forward-looking statements include,
among other things, the information concerning our possible future results of operations, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expectations that regulatory developments or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our
business or financial condition, our competitive position and the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industry in which we operate, and the benefits and synergies to be obtained from our completed and any future acquisitions, and
statements of our goals and objectives, and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “predicts,”
“potential,” “continue,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “appears,” “projects” and similar
expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements. In evaluating those statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risks related to healthcare industry trends and those set forth
herein in

Item 1A. Risk Factors

.

Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or
results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect
to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Such factors include, among other things, the following:

•

our ability to comply with the existing laws and government regulations, and/or changes in laws and government regulations;



•

an increasing number of legislative initiatives have recently been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level. No assurances can be given that the
implementation of these new laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations;

•

possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government based payors, including Medicare or Medicaid in the United States, and government based payors in
the United Kingdom;

•

an increase in the number of uninsured and self-pay patients treated at our acute care facilities that unfavorably impacts our ability to satisfactorily and timely collect our self-pay patient accounts;

•

our ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same, including contracts with United/Sierra Healthcare in Las Vegas, Nevada;

•

the outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, false claim act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us and other matters as disclosed in

Item 3. Legal
Proceedings

;

•

the potential unfavorable impact on our business of deterioration in national, regional and local economic and business conditions, including a worsening of unfavorable credit market conditions;

•

competition from other healthcare providers (including physician owned facilities) in certain markets;

•

technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for healthcare;

•

our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses and other healthcare professionals;

•

demographic changes;

•

our ability to successfully integrate and improve our recent acquisitions and the availability of suitable acquisitions and divestiture opportunities;

•

as discussed below in

Sources of Revenue

, we receive revenues from various state and county based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate, (we receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90
million annually from each of Texas, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Nevada, Virginia and Florida); CMS-approved Medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including Texas, Oklahoma, Illinois, Mississippi, Arkansas and
California, and; state Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including Texas and South Carolina. We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well
as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. We can provide no assurance that reductions to revenues earned pursuant to these programs, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse
effect on our future results of operations;

•

our ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms, including borrowed funds, to fund the future growth of our business;

•

some of our acute care facilities continue to experience decreasing inpatient admission trends;

•

our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors and there can be no assurance that failure of the payors to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect
on our future results of operations;

•

in March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were enacted into law and
created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs. The two combined primary goals of these acts are to provide for increased access to
coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses. Medicare, Medicaid and other



health care industry changes are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade. We cannot predict the effect, if any, these enactments will have on our future results of
operations;

•

the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published final regulations in July, 2010 implementing the health information technology (“HIT”) provisions of the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment
incentive programs. The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. Hospitals that do not
qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. We believe that all of our acute
care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015. However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to
meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year. Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria
would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations. There will likely be timing differences in the recognition of the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the EHR applications
which may cause material period-to-period changes in our future results of operations;

•

in August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) was enacted into law. The 2011 Act imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by
$917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction
(the “Joint Committee”), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the
November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year
(approximately $35 million annual reduction to our Medicare net revenues effective as of April 1, 2013) with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. We cannot predict whether Congress will restructure the implemented
Medicare payment reductions or what other federal budget deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress;

•

our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 include amounts due from Illinois of approximately $44 million and $49 million,
respectively. Collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures. Approximately $23 million as of December 31, 2014 and $28 million as of December 31, 2013, of the
receivables due from Illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date. In addition, our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 includes approximately $102 million and $62 million due from Texas in
connection with Medicaid supplemental payment programs. The $102 million due from Texas as of December 31, 2014 consists of $45 million related to uncompensated care program revenues, $33 million related to disproportionate share hospital
program revenues and $24 million related to Delivery Service Reform Incentive Payment program (“DSRIP”) revenues. Approximately $24 million of cash was received in January, 2015 from Texas related to the above-mentioned DSRIP receivables
outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Although the accounts receivable due from Illinois and Texas could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us, no related reserves have been
established in our consolidated financial statements. However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois and/or Texas. Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from these states
would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows. In September, 2014



CMS deferred the federal matching funds on Texas Medicaid uncompensated care payments made to providers in certain counties in Texas. Although our hospitals located in Texas were not impacted by
this deferral since they are not located in the impacted geographical areas, we can provide no assurance that our hospitals will not be impacted by future deferrals if CMS expands the deferrals to other counties in Texas. In January, 2015, CMS
removed the aforementioned deferral but indicated they will continue their review and assessment of the underlying uncompensated care financing arrangements to ensure compliance with the applicable federal regulations and eligibility for federal
matching funds;

•

there have been several attempts in Congress to repeal or modify various provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”). We cannot predict whether or not any of these proposed
changes to the PPACA will become law and therefore can provide no assurance that changes to the PPACA, as currently implemented, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. In addition, a case currently pending
before The Supreme Court of the United States,

King vs. Burwell

, challenges the federal government’s ability to subsidize premiums paid by certain eligible individuals that obtain health insurance policies through federally facilitated
exchanges. A number of our hospitals operate in states that utilize federally facilitated exchanges. The Supreme Court of the United States’ decision in this case could result in an increased number of uninsured patients treated at our
hospitals located in these states which would have an adverse impact on our future results of operations;

•

the ability to obtain adequate levels of general and professional liability insurance on current terms;

•

changes in our business strategies or development plans;

•

fluctuations in the value of our common stock, and;

•

other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Given these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, as outlined above, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking
statements. Our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. We assume no
obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except as may be required by law. All forward-looking statements
attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

A summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in Note 1 to the financial statements. We consider our critical accounting
policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements, including the following:

Revenue Recognition:

We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided.
Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 36% of our net patient revenues during 2014, 38% during 2013 and 39% during 2012. Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs
accounted for 50% of our net patient revenues during 2014 and 49% during each of 2013 and 2012.

We report net patient service revenue at
the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered. We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates. Payment
arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related
contractual agreements. We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and



regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available. However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments
from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.

We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest
available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations. The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are
extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term. Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state
Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our
estimates may vary from the final settlements. Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory
changes. As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Adjustments related to the final settlement of these
retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2014, 2013 and 2012. If it were to occur, each 1% adjustment to our estimated net Medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of
December 31, 2014, would change our after-tax net income by approximately $1 million.

We provide care to patients who meet certain
financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts
receivable, net. See additional disclosure below in

Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts

for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.

Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts:

Collection of receivables from third-party payers and
patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient’s responsibility, primarily co-payments and
deductibles. We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these
factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted. At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all
payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account. For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters. Our hospitals
establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old. All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of
discharge. Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge. Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of
financial assistance including our charity care policy. If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.

Historically, a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in
part, has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles. Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the
federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care. The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as
charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.

A portion of the accounts receivable at our
acute care facilities are comprised of Medicaid accounts that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers



such as county indigent programs in certain states. Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient’s responsible party at the time of registration. At
that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned. There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each
patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered. Certain patients may be classified as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently
Medicaid eligible. When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending, our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates, subject to
the ultimate disposition of the patient’s Medicaid eligibility. When the patient’s ultimate eligibility is determined, reclassifications may occur which impacts the reported amounts in future periods for the provision for doubtful accounts
and other accounts such as Medicaid pending. Although the patient’s ultimate eligibility determination may result in amounts being reclassified among these accounts from period to period, these reclassifications did not have a material impact
on our results of operations in 2014, 2013 or 2012 since our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.

We also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in “uninsured discounts” amounts below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or
charity care. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our net accounts receivable. In implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify
uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied. Effective January 1, 2014, in response to market
conditions and other considerations, we modified our uninsured discount policy and increased the discount to 60% of gross charges from 30% previously. Since we expect to collect only a small portion of amounts due from our uninsured patients, the
increase in the uninsured discount in 2014 had no material impact on our net revenues, net income attributable to UHS or net accounts receivable, as compared to prior year periods. However, this change resulted in an increase in uninsured discounts
and a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts. Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $325 million and $395 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Approximately 84% during 2014 and 90% during 2013 of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts, was incurred by our acute care
hospitals. Shown below is our payer mix concentrations and related aging of our billed accounts receivable, net of contractual allowances, for our acute care hospitals as of December 31, 2014 and 2013:

Accounting for Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Records Incentive Payments:

In July
2010, the Department of Health and Human Services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The regulation defines the “meaningful use” of
Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and established the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal
year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have
demonstrated “meaningful use” of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.

Medicare EHR incentive payments:

Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare
cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable “meaningful use” requirements. Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31

st

, we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the “meaningful use” criteria and during the fourth
quarter of each applicable subsequent year.

Medicaid EHR incentive payments:

Medicaid EHR incentive payments are determined based
upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the “meaningful use” criteria. Therefore, the majority of the Medicaid EHR incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable
hospitals were deemed to have met initial “meaningful use” criteria. Upon meeting subsequent fiscal year “meaningful use” criteria, our hospitals may become entitled to additional Medicaid EHR incentive payments which will be
recognized as incentive income in future periods. Medicaid EHR incentive payments received prior to our hospitals meeting the “meaningful use” criteria were included in other current liabilities (as deferred EHR incentive income) in our
consolidated balance sheet.

Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks:

We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and
professional liability claims and workers’ compensation claims. Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and
reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial
insurance policies. All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability
claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate. Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized
currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense. In addition, we also: (i) own a commercial health insurer headquartered in Reno, Nevada, and; (ii) maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and
dental claims. The ultimate costs related to these programs/operations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported. Given our
significant insurance-related exposure, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

Professional and General Liability and Workers Compensation Liability:

Effective November, 2010, excluding certain subsidiaries acquired since 2010 as discussed below, the vast majority of our subsidiaries are
self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million and $3 million per occurrence, respectively. Our subsidiaries were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage
in excess of the applicable per occurrence self-insured retention (either $3 million or $10 million) up to $250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for claims incurred in 2014 and up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for
claims incurred from 2011



through 2013. We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.

Since our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (“PSI”) in November, 2010, the former PSI subsidiaries are self-insured for
professional and general liability exposure up to $3 million per occurrence. The nine behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation (“Ascend”) in October, 2012 have general and professional liability policies through
commercial insurance carriers which provide for up to $12 million of aggregate coverage, subject to a $100,000 per occurrence deductible. The 17 facilities acquired from Cygnet Health Care Limited (“Cygnet”), consisting of 15 inpatient
behavioral health hospitals and 2 nursing homes, have policies through a commercial insurance carrier located in the United Kingdom that provides for £10 million of professional liability coverage and £25 million of general
liability coverage. The facilities acquired from PSI, Ascend and Cygnet, like our other facilities, are also provided excess coverage through commercial insurance carriers for coverage in excess of the underlying commercial policy limitations, as
mentioned above.

Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors
including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical
experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current
estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate. Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of
claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

As of December 31, 2014, the
total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $193 million, of which $51 million is included in current liabilities. As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $206
million, of which $44 million is included in current liabilities.

We recorded reductions to our professional and general liability
self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $20 million during 2014, $81 million during 2013 and $27 million during 2012. The favorable changes recorded during 2014 and 2012 resulted from changes in our estimated future claims
payments pursuant to a reserve analysis. The favorable change in our estimated future claims payments recorded during 2013, relating to years prior to 2013, were due primarily to: (i) an increased weighting given to company-specific metrics (to
100% from 75%), and decreased general industry metrics (to 0% from 25%), related to projected incidents per exposure, historical claims experience and loss development factors; (ii) historical data which measured the realized favorable impact
of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate, and; (iii) a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety
initiative undertaken during the last several years. As the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased, thereby providing for a statistically significant data group, and taking into consideration our long-history of
company-specific risk management programs and claims experience, our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry
trends.

As of December 31, 2014, the total accrual for our workers’ compensation liability claims was $67 million, of which $32
million is included in current liabilities. As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our workers’ compensation liability claims was $64 million, of which $34 million is included in current liabilities. During the last three years,
adjustments recorded to our prior year reserves for workers’ compensation claims did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.

Although we are unable to predict whether or not our future financial statements will include adjustments to our prior year reserves for
self-insured general and professional and workers’ compensation claims, given the relatively unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the factors impacting these reserves, as discussed above, it is reasonably likely that our
future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves.

General and professional liability amounts are net of adjustments recorded during each year, as discussed above.

Property Insurance:

We
have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence, subject to a $250,000 deductible for the majority of our properties (the properties acquired from
PSI are subject to a $50,000 deductible). Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property. In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering
catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses). Our earthquake limit is $250 million, subject to a deductible of $250,000, except for facilities located
within documented fault zones. Earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the United States are subject to a $100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value
of the property. The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million, subject to a $25,000 deductible. Non-critical flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility. Since certain of our facilities
have been designated by our insurer as flood prone, we have elected to purchase policies from The National Flood Insurance Program to cover a substantial portion of the applicable deductible. Property insurance for the facilities acquired from
Cygnet are provided on an all risk basis up to a £180 million limit that includes coverage for real and personal property as well as business interruption losses.

Long-Lived Assets:

We review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow. If the
analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using
appropriate discount rates.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for
impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting
unit. We have designated September 1

st

as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2014 which indicated no impairment of goodwill
or indefinite-lived intangible assets. There were also no impairments during 2013 or 2012. Future changes in the



estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a
portion or all of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. We believe that future income will enable us
to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.

We operate
in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws. We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities. Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) through the year ended December 31, 2006. We
believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.

Year Ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013:

Net revenues increased 11% or $782 million to $8.07 billion during 2014 as compared to $7.28 billion during 2013. The increase was primarily
attributable to:

•

a $557 million or 8% increase in net revenues generated at our acute care hospitals and behavioral health care facilities owned during both periods (which we refer to as “same facility”), and;

•

other combined net increase of $225 million consisting primarily of the net revenues generated during 2014 related to acquisitions made during the year including: (i) a commercial health insurer headquartered in
Reno, Nevada; (ii) the 17 behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom acquired as part of our acquisition of Cygnet Health Care Limited, and; (iii) a 124-bed behavioral health care facility and outpatient treatment center
located in Washington, D.C. Also contributing to the increase in net revenues was a full year of net revenues generated during 2014 at Temecula Valley Hospital, a 140-bed, newly constructed acute care facility that was completed and opened during
the fourth quarter of 2013.



Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests)
increased $60 million to $930 million during 2014 as compared to $869 million during 2013. Included in our income before income taxes during 2014, as compared to 2013, was the following:

a.

an increase of $202 million at our acute care facilities as discussed below in Acute Care Hospital Services, excluding the EHR impact (as mentioned in f. below) and excluding the change resulting from the reductions to
our prior year professional and general liability self-insurance reserves recorded during 2014 and 2013 (as mentioned in c. below);

b.

an increase of $57 million at our behavioral health care facilities, as discussed below in Behavioral Health Services, excluding the change resulting from the reductions to our prior year professional and general
liability self-insurance reserves during 2014 and 2013 (as mentioned in c. below);

c.

a net decrease of $61 million resulting from the change in the reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves recorded during 2014 and 2013 based upon reserve analyses, as discussed above
in

Professional and General Liability and Workers Compensation Liability

($20 million reduction recorded during 2014 of which $11 million was applicable to our acute care hospitals and $9 million was applicable to our behavioral health care
facilities, as compared to an $81 million reduction recorded during 2013 of which $63 million was applicable to our acute care hospitals and $18 million was applicable to our behavioral health care facilities);

d.

a decrease of $48 million resulting from a charge incurred in connection with the settlement of the

Garden City Employees’ Retirement System v. Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.

matter, a shareholder class action
lawsuit filed in 2009 against PSI and certain of its former officers alleging their violations of federal securities laws. We assumed the defense and liability of this matter as a result of our acquisition of PSI in 2010. The charge incurred during
2014 is net of approximately $17 million of commercial insurance recoveries, net of related legal fees, that we were entitled to;

e.

a decrease of $36 million recorded during 2014 in connection with the costs related to extinguishment of debt resulting primarily from the early redemption of our previously outstanding $250 million, 7.00% senior
unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in 2018 and the repayment of $550 million of borrowings pursuant to the terms of our previously outstanding Term Loan B facility which was scheduled to mature in 2016;

f.

a decrease of $27 million related to the incentive income ($28 million in 2014 and $61 million in 2013), net of related expenses ($37 million in 2014 and $43 million in 2013), recorded during each year in connection
with the implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals;

g.

an increase of $10 million due to the pre-tax gain realized during 2014 resulting from the divestiture of a non-operating investment (sold during the first quarter of 2014), and;

h.

$37 million of other combined net decreases.

Net income attributable to UHS increased $35
million to $545 million during 2014 as compared to $511 million during 2013. The increase consisted of:

•

an increase of $60 million in income before income taxes, as discussed above;

•

a decrease of $16 million resulting from an increase in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and;

•

a decrease of $9 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from: (i) the income tax provision on the $44 million increase in pre-tax income ($60 million increase in
income before income taxes less the $16 million decrease in income resulting from an increase in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests), partially offset by; (ii) the income tax provision recorded during 2013 on the sale of Peak
Behavioral Health Services (the tax basis gain realized on the sale in 2013 exceeded the gain recorded pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles), and; (iii) a decrease during 2014, as compared to 2013, to our blended effective state
income tax rate.



Year Ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012:

Net revenues increased 5% or $322 million to $7.28 billion during 2013 as compared to $6.96 billion during 2012. The increase was primarily
attributable to:

•

a $239 million or 4% increase in net revenues generated at our acute care hospitals and behavioral health care facilities owned during both periods, and;

•

other combined net increase of $83 million consisting primarily of the net revenues generated during the first ten months of 2013 at nine behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October,
2012 (the operating results for these facilities for the months of November and December of 2013 and 2012 are included in our behavioral health care facilities-same facility basis results).

Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $106 million to $869 million
during 2013 as compared to $764 million during 2012. Included in our income before income taxes during 2013, as compared to 2012, was the following:

a.

a decrease of $28 million at our acute care facilities as discussed below in

Acute Care Hospital Services

, excluding the impact of the applicable items mentioned in c., d., h., and j., below;

b.

an increase of $57 million at our behavioral health facilities, as discussed below in

Behavioral Health Services,

excluding the impact of the applicable items mentioned in c., and i., below;

c.

a net increase of $53 million resulting from reductions recorded during 2013 and 2012 to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves, as discussed above in

Professional and General Liability and
Workers Compensation Liability

($81 million reduction recorded in 2013 of which $63 million was applicable to our acute care hospitals and $18 million was applicable to our behavioral health facilities, and $27 million reduction recorded during
2012 of which $23 million was applicable to our acute care hospitals and $4 million was applicable to our behavioral health facilities);

d.

a decrease of $33 million (net of related expenses) resulting from the pre-tax income recorded during 2012 related to an agreement, which was part of an industry-wide settlement related to underpayments of Medicare
inpatient prospective payments during a number of prior years, entered into with the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;

e.

a decrease of $26 million resulting from a gain realized on the sale of an acute care hospital (Auburn Regional Medical Center) which was sold during the fourth quarter of 2012;

f.

an increase of $29 million resulting from the write-off deferred financing costs, during 2012, related to the portion of our previously outstanding Term Loan B credit facility that was extinguished during the third
quarter of 2012;

g.

an increase of $33 million due to a decrease in interest expense resulting primarily from a decrease in our average effective borrowing rate during 2013 as compared to 2012 (as discussed below in

Interest
Expense

);

h.

a net aggregate increase of $11 million resulting from the following unfavorable items recorded during 2012: (i) the revised Supplemental Security Income ratios utilized for calculating Medicare disproportionate
share hospital reimbursements for federal fiscal years 2006 through 2009 ($7 million unfavorable impact), and; (ii) the write-off of receivables related to revenues recorded during 2011 at two of our acute care hospitals located in Florida
resulting from reductions in certain county reimbursements due to reductions in federal matching Inter-Governmental Transfer funds ($4 million unfavorable impact);

i.

a decrease of $14 million resulting from the 2011 portion, recorded in 2012, of net Medicaid supplemental reimbursements earned pursuant to new programs initiated in certain states in which we operate behavioral health
facilities, most notably the Oklahoma Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program which was approved during 2012, retroactive to July 1, 2011;



j.

an increase of $16 million related to the incentive income ($61 million in 2013 and $30 million in 2012), net of related expenses ($43 million in 2013 and $28 million in 2012), recorded during the each year in
connection with the implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals, and;

k.

$8 million of other combined net increases.

Net income attributable to UHS increased $67
million to $511 million during 2013 as compared to $443 million during 2012. The increase consisted of:

•

an increase of $106 million in income before income taxes, as discussed above;

•

an increase of $2 million resulting from a decrease in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and;

•

a decrease of $41 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from the income tax provision on the $108 million increase in pre-tax income ($106 million increase in income
before income taxes plus the $2 million increase in income resulting from a decrease in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests).

Acute Care Hospital Services

Year Ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013:

Acute Care Hospitals-Same Facility Basis

We believe that providing our results on a “Same Facility” basis, which includes the operating results for facilities owned in both
the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance. Our “Same Facility” results also neutralize the impact of the EHR applications and the effect of items that are non-operational
in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that
relate to prior periods.

The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities on a same facility basis
and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollar amounts in thousands):

On a same facility basis during 2014, as compared to 2013, net revenues at our acute care
hospitals increased $355 million or 10%. Income before income taxes increased $207 million or 75% to $484 million or 12.3% of net revenues during 2014 as compared to $277 million or 7.8% of net revenues during 2013.

The increased income before income taxes experienced at our acute care facilities during 2014, as compared to 2013, was due in part to
improving general economic conditions as well as a decrease in the number of uninsured patients treated at our hospitals. The decrease in the number of uninsured patients treated at our acute care hospitals was due primarily to the favorable impact
of the Affordable Care Act which includes the expansion of Medicaid in certain states in which we operate and the enrollment of patients in newly created commercial exchanges.

Inpatient admissions to these facilities increased 0.6% during 2014, as compared to 2013, while patient days increased 3.9%. Adjusted
admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased 3.1% and adjusted patient days increased 6.5% during 2014, as compared to 2013. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.7 days during 2014 and 4.5 days during 2013.
The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 58% during 2014 and 56% during 2013. On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities increased 6.6% during 2014, as compared to 2013,
and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 3.3% during 2014, as compared to 2013.

During 2014, as compared to 2013, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased $529 million or 15% to
$4.11 billion due primarily to: (i) a $355 million, or 10%, increase same facility revenues, as discussed above, and; (ii) other combined net increase of $174 million consisting primarily of the net revenues generated during 2014 related
to the acquisition of a commercial health insurer headquartered in Reno, Nevada and a full year of net revenues generated during 2014 at Temecula Valley Hospital, a 140-bed, newly constructed acute care facility that was completed and opened during
the fourth quarter of 2013.



Income before income taxes increased $123 million to $465 million or 11.3% of net revenues during
2014 as compared to $342 million or 9.6% of net revenues during 2013.

Included in these results are the following:

•

the $207 million increase in income before income taxes experienced during 2014, as compared to 2013, at our acute care hospitals, on a same facility basis, as discussed above;

•

a net decrease of $52 million net increase resulting from reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves attributable to our acute care hospitals recorded during 2014 ($11 million) and 2013
($63 million), as discussed above in

Professional and General Liability and Workers Compensation Liability

;

•

a net decrease of $27 million related to the incentive income ($28 million in 2014 and $61 million in 2013), net of related expenses ($37 million in 2014 and $43 million in 2013), recorded in connection with the
implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals, and;

•

a net other combined decrease of $5 million consisting primarily of the decreased operating losses incurred at a Temecula Valley Hospital, offset by the operating losses incurred at a commercial health insurer acquired
during 2014.

Uncompensated care (charity care and uninsured discounts):

The following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at

The provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals decreased to approximately $590 million during
2014 as compared to $1.02 billion during 2013. The decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts during 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to the increase in the uninsured discount (effective January 1, 2014, as discussed above in

Charity Care, Uninsured discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts)

, and reclassifications among provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending based upon our patients’ ultimate eligibility determination,
as discussed above.

The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care:

The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of
operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts. The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute
care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities. An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided
could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.

During 2014, as compared to 2013, net revenues at our behavioral health care facilities increased 8% or $278
million to $3.95 billion during 2014 as compared to $3.67 billion during 2013. The increase in net revenues was attributable to:

•

a $202 million or 6% increase in same facility revenues, as discussed above;

•

a $65 million increase related to 2014 acquisitions including the following: (i) the 17 behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom acquired as part of our acquisition of Cygnet Health Care Limited,
and; (ii) a 124-bed behavioral health care facility and outpatient treatment center located in Washington, D.C, and;

•

$11 million of other combined increases.

Income before income taxes increased $48 million or
5% to $944 million or 23.9% of net revenues during 2014 as compared to $896 million or 24.4% of net revenues during 2013. The increase in income before income taxes at our behavioral health facilities was attributable to:

•

a $45 million increase at our behavioral health facilities on a same facility basis, as discussed above;

•

an $11 million increase related to the acquisition of the facilities from Cygnet Health Care Limited and the 124-bed behavioral health care facility and outpatient treatment center located in Washington, D.C.;

•

a $9 million net decrease resulting from reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves applicable to our behavioral health facilities recorded during 2014 ($9 million) and 2013 ($18
million), as discussed above in

Professional and General Liability and Workers Compensation Liability

, and;

•

a $1 million other combined net increase.

On a same facility basis during 2013, as compared to 2012, net revenues at our behavioral health care
facilities increased $110 million or 3% to $3.51 billion during 2013 as compared to $3.40 billion during 2012. Income before income taxes increased $36 million or 4% to $854 million or 24.3% of net revenues during 2013 as compared to $818 million or
24.1% of net revenues during 2012.

Inpatient admissions to these facilities increased 3.2% during 2013, as compared to 2012, while
patient days increased 0.7%. Adjusted admissions increased 3.5% and adjusted patient days increased 1.0% during 2013, as compared to 2012. The average length of patient stay at these facilities was 13.4 days during 2013 and 13.7 days during 2012.
The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 75% during 2013 and 74% during 2012. On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities decreased 0.3% during 2013, as compared to 2012,
and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 2.2% during 2013, as compared to 2012.

During 2013, as compared to 2012, net revenues at our behavioral health care facilities increased 6% or $208
million to $3.67 billion during 2013 as compared to $3.46 billion during 2012. The increase in net revenues was attributable to:

•

a $110 million increase in same facility revenues, as discussed above;

•

a $137 million increase related to the 9 facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012 (consisting of the net revenues generated at the facilities during January through October of 2013, offset by
the net revenues generated at the facilities during the partial month of October, 2012);

•

a $14 million decrease due to the revenues recorded during 2012 representing the 2011 portion of the net Medicaid supplemental reimbursements earned pursuant to the Oklahoma Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program
as well as similar programs in Ohio and Indiana, and;

•

$25 million of other combined decreases resulting primarily from the divestiture, closure or operational wind-down of certain non-strategic behavioral health facilities/schools.

Income before income taxes increased $57 million or 7% to $896 million or 24.4% of net revenues during 2013, as compared to $839 million or
24.2% of net revenues during 2012. The increase in income before income taxes at our behavioral health facilities was attributable to:

•

a $36 million increase at our behavioral health facilities on a same facility basis, as discussed above;

•

a $14 million decrease resulting from the revenues recorded during 2012 representing the 2011 portion of the net Medicaid supplemental reimbursements earned pursuant to the Oklahoma Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment
Program as well as similar programs in Ohio and Indiana;

($4 million), as discussed above in

Professional and General Liability and Workers Compensation Liability

, and;

•

a $21 million of other combined net increases, including the income generated at the nine facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012.

Sources of Revenue

Overview:

We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under
the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.

Hospital revenues depend
upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services. Charges and
reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for
various reasons, many of which are beyond our control. The percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more
services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis. We believe that our
experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues.

Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under
Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and
co-insurance has generally been increasing each year. Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business
payers which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts.

The following tables show the approximate percentages of net
patient revenue during the past three years (excludes sources of revenues for all periods presented for divested facilities which are reflected as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements) for: (i) our Acute Care and
Behavioral Health Care Facilities Combined; (ii) our Acute Care Facilities, and; (iii) our Behavioral Health Care Facilities. Net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts
from established billing rates, which we derived from various sources of payment for the years indicated.

Medicare:

Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits
to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental
authorities. Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program,
our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.

Under the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective
payment system (“IPPS”). Under the IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge. The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient’s Medicare severity diagnosis related group
(“MS-DRG”). Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis. The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national
average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care. This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG. The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the
predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity. While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for
inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for an “outlier” payment if a particular patient’s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold.

MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG
rates, known as the “hospital market basket index,” gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than
the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals.

In August, 2014, CMS published its IPPS 2015 payment
rule which provides for a 2.9% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform
mandated adjustments are considered, without consideration for the decreases related to the required Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (“DSH”) payment changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the



overall increase in IPPS payments would approximate 0.6%. Including the estimated decreases to our DSH payments (–1.9%) and Medicare Outlier threshold (–0.6%), we estimate our overall
decrease from the IPPS 2015 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015) will approximate (–1.9%), or approximately $13 million annually. This projected impact from the IPPS 2015 rule includes both the
impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the DSH payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions
related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, as discussed below.

In August, 2013, CMS published its final IPPS 2014 payment rule which
provides for a 2.5% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated
adjustments are considered, we estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2014 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014) approximated 1.0%. This projected impact from the IPPS 2014 final
rule includes both the impact of the ATRA of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the
impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, as discussed below. The final rule also expands CMS’s policy under which it defines inpatient admissions to include the use of an objective time of care standard.
Specifically, it would require Medicare’s external review contractors to presume that hospital inpatient admissions are reasonable and necessary when beneficiaries receive a physician order for admission and receive medically necessary services
for at least two midnights (the “Two Midnight” rule). Correspondingly, under the final rule, CMS presumes that hospital services spanning less than two midnights should have been provided on an outpatient basis and paid under Medicare Part
B unless the medical record contains clear documentation supporting the physician’s order and an expectation that the Medicare beneficiary would need medically necessary care for more than two midnights, or is receiving services which CMS
designates as inpatient only. Our acute care hospitals have begun to comply with the Two Midnight rule and, although we are unable to determine the ultimate impact at this time, its application could have a material unfavorable impact on our future
results of operations. Excluding the potential impact of the Two Midnight rule, we do not expect the final IPPS 2014 payment rule to have a material impact on our future results of operations. In February, 2014, CMS extended by an additional six
months a policy under which Recovery Auditor Contractors and other Medicare review contractors will not conduct post-payment patient status reviews of inpatient hospital claims with dates of admission on or after October 1, 2013 through
September 30, 2014. Due to the continued delay in awarding contracts to new Recovery Audit Contractors, beginning in August, 2014, CMS initiated modifications to the current Recovery Auditor Contractor agreements to allow the restart of some
reviews.

In August, 2012, CMS published its final IPPS 2013 payment rule which provided for a 2.6% market basket increase to the base
Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, we estimate our overall increase
from the final federal fiscal year 2013 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013) approximated 1.8%. The impact from the IPPS 2013 final rule reflects all of the adjustments described in this paragraph,
however, it excludes the impact of potential reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, as discussed below.

In August, 2011,
the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) was enacted into law. Included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012
and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which was responsible for developing recommendations
aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary,
national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year (approximately $35 million annual reduction to our Medicare net revenues effective as of
April 1, 2013) with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs.



On January 2, 2013 ATRA was enacted which, among other things, includes a requirement for
CMS to recoup $11 billion from hospitals from Medicare IPPS rates during federal fiscal years 2014 to 2017. The recoupment relates to IPPS documentation and coding adjustments for the period 2008 to 2013 for which adjustments were not
previously applied by CMS. Both the 2014 and 2015 IPPS final rules include a -0.8% recoupment adjustment. CMS expects to make similar adjustments in federal fiscal years 2016 and 2017 in order to recover the entire $11 billion. This adjustment is
reflected in the 2014 and 2015 IPPS estimated impact amounts noted above.

On January 1, 2005, CMS implemented a new Psychiatric
Prospective Payment System (“Psych PPS”) for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program. This system replaced the cost-based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem Psych PPS with adjustments to
account for certain facility and patient characteristics. The Psych PPS also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. In August,
2012, CMS published its final Psych PPS rate notice for the federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2012. That final notice contained a Psych PPS market basket update of 2.7%, which was reduced by 0.7% to reflect a productivity adjustment, and
reduced by 0.1% to reflect an “other adjustment” required by the Social Security Act for rate years 2010 through 2019. In July, 2013, CMS released its final Psych PPS rate notice for the federal fiscal year 2014. The final notice contains
a Psych PPS market basket update of 2.6% which is reduced by 0.5% to reflect a productivity adjustment, and reduced by 0.1% to reflect an “other adjustment” required by the Social Security Act.

On July 31, 2014, CMS published it Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2015. Under this final rule, payments to psychiatric
hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 2.1% compared to federal fiscal year 2014. This amount includes the effect of the 2.9% market basket update adjusted by the Affordable Care Act required 0.3% reduction and the -0.5% productivity
adjustment. The final rule also updates the Inpatient Psychiatric Quality Reporting Program, which requires psychiatric facilities to report on quality measures or incur a reduction in their annual payment update.

In October, 2014, CMS published its Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“OPPS”) final rule for 2015. The proposed
hospital market basket increase is 2.9%. The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.2% reduction to the 2015 OPPS market basket resulting in a 2015 OPPS market basket update at 2.2%. In the final rule, CMS will
reduce the 2015 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs. When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization
rates are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS for 2015 will aggregate to a net increase of 0.2%. Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2015 is
estimated to be 1.5%.

In December, 2013, CMS published its annual final OPPS rule for 2014. The final hospital market basket increase is
2.5%. The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.3% reduction to the 2014 OPPS market basket reducing the final 2014 OPPS market basket update to 1.7%. In the final rule, CMS reduced the 2014 Medicare rates for
both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs. When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, we estimate that
our overall Medicare OPPS for 2014 will aggregate to a net increase of 1.4%. Excluding the behavioral health partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2014 is estimated to be 2.5%.

In November, 2012, CMS published its annual final Medicare OPPS rule for 2013. The market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.6%. In
addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS was also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.1% in federal fiscal year 2013 and to reduce the annual update by a productivity
adjustment which is 0.7%. In the final rule, CMS implemented a significant increase in the 2013 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs. When other statutorily required adjustments,
hospital



patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2013 is estimated to be 3.5%. Excluding the behavioral
health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2013 was approximately 1.7%.

Medicaid:

Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or
under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. In addition to revenues received
pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid. All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are
certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.

We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90
million annually from each of Texas, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Nevada, Virginia and Florida, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory,
economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. Based upon the state budgets for those states for the 2015 fiscal year (which generally began at various times during the second half of 2014), we estimate that, on a blended basis,
our aggregate Medicaid rates were relatively unchanged from the 2014 fiscal year rates.

The Affordable Care Act substantially increases
the federally and state-funded Medicaid insurance program, and authorizes states to establish federally subsidized non-Medicaid health plans for low-income residents not eligible for Medicaid starting in 2014. However, the Supreme Court has struck
down portions of the Affordable Care Act requiring states to expand their Medicaid programs in exchange for increased federal funding. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that states in which we operate will expand Medicaid coverage to
individuals at 133% of the federal poverty level. Facilities in states not opting to expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act may be additionally penalized by corresponding reductions to Medicaid disproportionate share hospital
payments, as discussed below. We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

Texas Uncompensated Care/Upper Payment Limit Payments:

Certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas (Hidalgo, Maverick, Potter and Webb) participate in Medicaid
supplemental payment Section 1115 Waiver indigent care programs. Section 1115 Waiver Uncompensated Care (“UC”) payments replace the former Upper Payment Limit (“UPL”) payments. These hospitals also have affiliation agreements
with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties. Our hospitals receive both supplemental payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party,
affiliated hospitals. The supplemental payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer (“IGT”) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of
funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals. However, the county or hospital district is prohibited from entering into an agreement to condition any IGT on the amount of any private hospital’s indigent care obligation. We recorded net
revenues/benefit from UPL and affiliated hospital indigent care revenues of $68 million during 2014, $61 million during 2013 and $25 million during 2012, net of provider taxes (of $17 million in 2014, $10 million in 2013 and $0 in 2012). If the
applicable hospital district or county makes IGTs consistent with 2014 levels, and without giving effect to potential reductions resulting from the February, 2015, THHSC proposed rule, which is discussed below, we believe we would be entitled to
aggregate net revenues/benefit earned pursuant to these programs of approximately $58 million during 2015, net of provider taxes (of $11 million). On February 6, 2015, THHSC published a proposed rule that would shift $136 million in funding from the
private hospital UC pool to the large public hospital UC pool for the 2014 UC program year only. THHSC has not provided an estimated impact from this proposed shift due to the fact that certain UC data elements are not yet available. As such, we are
unable to estimate the impact of this proposed rule change.



On September 30, 2014, CMS notified the Texas Health and Human Services Commission that it was
deferring the federal matching funds (approximately $75 million) on Texas Medicaid UC payments made to providers in certain counties. A deferral results in CMS withholding funds from the state representing the federal portion of Medicaid payments
the state has previously made to providers. A deferral goes into effect when CMS questions the basis for all or part of the amount of Medicaid payments made to certain providers, and remains in place subject to CMS’s final determination. Our
Texas hospitals are not located in the geographic areas impacted by this deferral. On January 7, 2015, CMS removed the aforementioned deferral but indicated they will continue their review and assessment of the underlying UC financing arrangements
as to ensure their compliance with the applicable federal regulations and eligibility for federal matching dollars.

For state fiscal year
2015, Texas Medicaid will continue to operate under a CMS-approved Section 1115 five-year Medicaid waiver demonstration program. During the first five years of this program that started in state fiscal year 2012, the Texas Health and Human
Services Commission (“THHSC”) transitioned away from UPL payments to new waiver incentive payment programs, UC payments and Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments (“DSRIP”). During the first year of transition, which commenced
on October 1, 2011, THHSC made payments to Medicaid UPL recipient providers that received payments during the state’s prior fiscal year. During demonstration years two through five (October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2016),
THHSC has, and will continue to, make incentive payments under the program after certain qualifying criteria are met by hospitals. Supplemental payments are also subject to an aggregate statewide caps based on CMS approved Medicaid waiver amounts.

Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments:

In addition, the Texas Medicaid Section 1115 Waiver includes a DSRIP pool to incentivize hospitals and other providers to transform their
service delivery practices to improve quality, health status, patient experience, coordination, and cost-effectiveness. DSRIP pool payments are incentive payments to hospitals and other providers that develop programs or strategies to enhance access
to health care, increase the quality of care, the cost-effectiveness of care provided and the health of the patients and families served. In May, 2014, CMS formally approved specific DSRIP projects for certain of our hospitals for demonstration
years 3 to 5 (our facilities did not materially participate in the DSRIP pool during demonstration years 1 or 2). DSRIP payments are contingent on the hospital meeting certain pre-determined milestones, metrics and clinical outcomes. Additionally,
DSRIP payments are contingent on a governmental entity providing an IGT for the non-federal share component of the DSRIP payment. THHSC generally approves DSRIP reported metrics, milestones and clinical outcomes on a semi-annual basis in June and
December. In connection with the DSRIP program and THHSC’s approval for specific programs at certain of our hospitals and availability of a governmental IGT, we recorded approximately $17 million of net revenues/benefit during 2014 applicable
to the period of October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014, net of provider taxes (of $8 million). Although we can provide no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for additional DSRIP revenues, subject to CMS’s approval and
other conditions as outlined above, we estimate that we may be entitled to additional DSRIP net revenues/benefit of approximately $25 million during 2015, net of provider taxes (of $15 million).

Texas and South Carolina Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments:

Hospitals that have an unusually large number of low-income patients (i.e., those with a Medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard
deviation above the mean Medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) adjustment. Congress established a national limit on DSH
adjustments. Although this legislation and the resulting state broad-based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the Medicaid program, to date the net impact has not been materially adverse.

Upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas’ and South Carolina’s low income patients, five
of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina received additional reimbursement from each state’s DSH fund. The South Carolina and Texas DSH programs were renewed for each state’s 2014 DSH fiscal year
(covering the period of October 1, 2013 through September 30,



2014). In September, 2013, the THHSC published its 2013 final DSH rule that included changes that resulted in approximately $9 million of additional reimbursements to our acute care facilities
located in Texas applicable to the state’s 2013 fiscal year (which were included in our 2013 pre-tax consolidated financial results). In connection with these DSH programs, included in our financial results was an aggregate of $49 million
during 2014, $54 million during 2013 and $47 million during 2012. Assuming that the Texas and South Carolina programs are renewed for each state’s 2015 and 2016 fiscal years, at amounts similar to the 2014 fiscal year estimates, we estimate our
aggregate reimbursements pursuant to these programs to be approximately $49 million during 2015.

The Affordable Care Act provides for a
significant reduction in Medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in federal fiscal year 2016 (see below in

Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform-Medicaid Revisions

for additional disclosure). The U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services is to determine the amount of Medicaid DSH payment cuts imposed on each state based on a defined methodology. As Medicaid DSH payments to states will be cut, consequently, payments to Medicaid-participating providers, including our
hospitals in Texas and South Carolina, will likely be reduced in the coming years. Based on the September, 2013 CMS final rule, our Medicaid DSH payments in Texas and South Carolina could be reduced by approximately 4% in the 2016 federal fiscal
year. This statutorily required reduction was originally scheduled to be implemented in federal fiscal year 2014 but was delayed to FFY 2017 by subsequent federal legislation.

In May, 2013 the state of Texas enacted legislation that would increase the state’s contribution of the non-federal DSH share for the
2013 DSH year to $138 million as compared to the $100 million previously expected. Similarly, the state’s approved 2014-2015 General Appropriations bill (“Rider 86”) passed in May, 2013 authorized $160 million for 2014 and $140
million for 2015, respectively, for the non-federal DSH share. Furthermore, in June, 2014, THHSC proposed certain changes to DSH reimbursement methodology as a result of Rider 86. We expect the 2015 DSH year amounts, to be comparable to the 2014 DSH
year amounts.

Various Other State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs:

We incur health-care related taxes (“Provider Taxes”) imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory
payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items of services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services. Such Provider Taxes
are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state Medicaid programs. We derive a related Medicaid
reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments. Including the impact of the programs in various states applicable to each year, and excluding
the impact of various programs in Texas, as discussed above, and the Nevada SPA, as discussed below, we earned an aggregate net revenues/benefit from Medicaid supplemental payments of approximately $71 million during 2014, $69 million during 2013
and $58 million during 2012 (of which $12 million related to 2011), net of Provider Taxes (of $112 million in 2014, $74 million in 2013 and $93 million in 2012). We estimate that our aggregate net revenues/benefit from Provider Tax programs will
approximate $70 million during 2015, net of Provider Taxes (of $111 million). These amounts include the impact of the CMS approved California provider tax and related Medicaid supplemental payment programs, which did not have a material impact on
our operating results. The aggregate net benefit is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular state’s portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements. However, Provider Taxes are governed by both federal
and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that, if reduced from current rates in several states, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated future results of operations.

In Nevada, CMS approved a state plan amendment (“SPA”) in August, 2014 that implemented a hospital supplemental payment program
retroactive to January 1, 2014 and effective to June 30, 2015. Included in our 2014 results of operations was approximately $10 million of net revenues earned in connection with this program. We estimate that our reimbursements pursuant to
this program will approximate $7 million during 2015.



As outlined above, we receive substantial reimbursement from multiple states in connection with
various supplemental Medicaid payment programs. Failure to renew these programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary IGTs for the states’ share of the DSH programs, failure of our
hospitals that currently receive supplemental Medicaid revenues to qualify for future funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

HITECH Act:

In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published final regulations implementing the
health information technology (“HIT”) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records
(“EHR”) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria. The implementation period for these new Medicare and
Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but
all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate have chosen to participate. Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the “meaningful
use” criteria. The government’s ultimate goal is to promote more effective (quality) and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all Americans and utilizing the cost savings to
expand access to the healthcare system.

Pursuant to HITECH Act regulations, hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by
2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the IPPS standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. We believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject
to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015. However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a
market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year. Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.

Our 2014 consolidated results of operations includes an unfavorable pre-tax impact of approximately $8 million consisting of approximately $28
million of EHR incentive income less approximately $37 million of depreciation and amortization expense, plus approximately $1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. Our 2013 consolidated results of operations includes a
favorable pre-tax impact of approximately $19 million consisting of approximately $61 million of EHR incentive income less approximately $10 million of salaries, wages, benefits and other operating expenses, approximately $33 million of depreciation
and amortization expense, plus approximately $1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. Our 2012 consolidated results of operations includes a favorable pre-tax impact of approximately $3 million consisting of approximately
$30 million of EHR incentive income less approximately $15 million of salaries, wages, benefits and other operating expenses, approximately $13 million of depreciation and amortization expense, plus approximately $1 million of net expense
attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the
Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable “meaningful use” requirements. Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on
December 31

st

, we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the “meaningful use” criteria and
during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.

Managed Care:

A significant portion of our net patient revenues
are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs. In general, we expect the
percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow. The consequent growth in



managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate. Typically, we receive lower payments per
patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies.

Commercial Insurance:

Our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance. Private
insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital’s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy. Private
insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor.

Commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including
predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services. To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers’ reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their
beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.

Other
Sources:

Our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage. Such patients are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state
poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals’ indigent and charity care policy. Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care
write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.

Sources of Revenues and Health
Care Reform:

Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments
received by our hospitals. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, the War on Terrorism, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, the
expansion of a Medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future. We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.

In March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872, P.L. 111-152), (the “Reconciliation Act”)
and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), (the “Affordable Care Act”), were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the
federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs. Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below.

Implemented Medicare Reductions and Reforms:

•

The Reconciliation Act reduced the market basket update for inpatient and outpatient hospitals and inpatient behavioral health facilities by 0.25% in each of 2010 and 2011, by 0.10% in each of 2012 and 2013 and 0.30% in
2014.

•

The Affordable Care Act implemented certain reforms to Medicare Advantage payments, effective in 2011.

•

A Medicare shared savings program, effective in 2012.

•

A hospital readmissions reduction program, effective in 2012.

•

A value-based purchasing program for hospitals, effective in 2012.

•

A national pilot program on payment bundling, effective in 2013.

•

Reduction to Medicare disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) payments, effective in 2014, as discussed above.



Medicaid Revisions:

•

Expanded Medicaid eligibility and related special federal payments, effective in 2014.

•

The Affordable Care Act (as amended by subsequent federal legislation) requires annual aggregate reductions in federal DSH funding from federal fiscal year (“FFY”) 2017 through FFY 2024. The aggregate annual
reduction amounts are:

$1.8 billion for FFY 2017

$4.7 billion for FFY 2018

$4.7
billion for FFY 2019

$4.7 billion for FFY 2020

$4.8 billion for FFY 2021

$5.0
billion for FFY 2022

$5.0 billion for FFY 2023

$4.4 billion for FFY 2024

Health
Insurance Revisions:

•

Large employer insurance reforms, effective in 2015.

•

Individual insurance mandate and related federal subsidies, effective in 2014.

•

Federally mandated insurance coverage reforms, effective in 2010 and forward.

The Affordable
Care Act seeks to increase competition among private health insurers by providing for transparent federal and state insurance exchanges. The Affordable Care Act also prohibits private insurers from adjusting insurance premiums based on health
status, gender, or other specified factors. We cannot provide assurance that these provisions will not adversely affect the ability of private insurers to pay for services provided to insured patients, or that these changes will not have a negative
material impact on our results of operations going forward.

Value-Based Purchasing:

There is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. These value-based purchasing programs include
both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data
to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events. Many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do
not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.

The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions intended to
promote value-based purchasing. The Affordable Care Act prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions (“HAC”). Beginning in FFY
2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments. Hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by
HHS will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard.

The Affordable Care Act also required HHS to implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective
on October 1, 2012. The Affordable Care Act requires HHS to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at 1% in FFY 2013 and increasing by



0.25% each fiscal year up to 2% in FFY 2017 and subsequent years. HHS will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality
performance standards established by HHS. HHS will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions. In its fiscal year 2015 IPPS
final rule, CMS will fund the value-based purchasing program by reducing base operating DRG payment amounts to participating hospitals by 1.5%.

Readmission Reduction Program:

In
the Affordable Care Act, Congress also mandated implementation of the hospital readmission reduction program (“HRRP”). The HRRP assesses penalties on hospitals having excess readmission rates when compared to expected rates, effective for
discharges beginning October 1, 2012. In the fiscal year 2013 IPPS final rule, CMS finalized certain policies with regard to payment under the HRRP, including which hospitals are subject to the HRRP, the methodology to calculate the hospital
readmission payment adjustment factor, and what portion of the IPPS payment is used to calculate the readmission adjustment factor. In the fiscal year 2014 IPPS final rule, CMS finalized revisions to the three 30-day admission measures in the
program—heart failure, myocardial infarction, and pneumonia—to exclude planned readmissions. Under the Affordable Care Act, beginning in fiscal year 2015, the maximum reduction in payments under the HRRP will increase from 2% to 3%. CMS
will expand the program and add two readmission measures, one, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and, two, patients admitted for elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In the fiscal
year 2015 IPPS final rule, CMS added readmissions for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgical procedures beginning in fiscal year 2017. We do not believe impact of HRRP for federal fiscal year 2014 had or will have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations.

Accountable Care Organizations:

The Affordable Care Act requires HHS to establish a Medicare Shared Savings Program that promotes accountability and coordination of care
through the creation of accountable care organizations (“ACOs”). The ACO program allows providers (including hospitals), physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure
and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. The program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards
established by HHS will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program.

In addition to statutory and
regulatory changes to the Medicare and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment
audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities.
The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers’ rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement
provisions. We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments. Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more
than ultimately required.

Finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls.
Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.

Other Operating Results

Combined net revenues and income/losses before income taxes from our surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology
centers did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2014, 2013 or 2012.

As discussed below in

Capital Resources-Credit Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities

, during the third quarter of 2014, we completed the following financing transactions:

•

On August 7, 2014, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to our credit agreement dated as of November 15, 2010, as amended on March 15, 2011, September 21, 2012 and May 16, 2013, among UHS, as
borrower, the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time parties thereto, as lenders (“Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement, as amended, which is scheduled to mature in August, 2019, consists of: (i) an $800
million revolving credit facility, and; (ii) a $1.775 billion term loan A facility which combined our previously outstanding term loan A and term loan A2 facilities (which were scheduled to mature in 2016);

•

Repaid $550 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to our previously outstanding term loan B facility which was scheduled to mature in 2016;

•

Increased the borrowing capacity on our existing $275 million accounts receivable securitization program (“Securitization”) to $360 million effective August 1, 2014. The Securitization, the terms of which
remain the same as the previous agreement, is scheduled to mature in October, 2016;

•

Issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% senior secured notes due in 2019;

•

Issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% senior secured notes due in 2022, and;

•

Redeemed our previously outstanding $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2018 on July 31, 2014 for an aggregate price equal to 104.56% of the principal amount (resulting in payment of an $11 million
make-whole premium).

As discussed below in

Costs Related to Early Extinguishment of Debt

, in connection with these
financing transactions, our 2014 results of operations included a $36 million pre-tax charge incurred for the costs related to the extinguishment of debt.

(b.)

In September, 2012, we completed a second amendment to our credit agreement dated November, 15, 2010, as amended. The second amendment provided for a
$900 million term loan A2, which was



subsequently combined into our new term loan A facility during the third quarter of 2014, as discussed above. In September, 2012, we used $700 million of the term loan A2 proceeds to repay our
then outstanding, higher priced term loan B facility. The remainder of the term loan A2 proceeds was used to pay transaction-related fees and expenses and to repay other floating rate debt.

(c.)

In May, 2013 we completed a third amendment to our credit agreement dated November 15, 2010, as amended. The third amendment provided for a reduction in the interest rates payable in connection with certain
borrowings outstanding at that time under the credit agreement. Specifically, we replaced our then outstanding $745.9 million senior secured term loan B with a new senior secured term loan B1 in the same amount on substantially the same terms as the
term loan B, other than lower interest rates.

Interest expense decreased $12 million during 2014 to $134 million as
compared to $146 million during 2013. The decrease was due primarily to: (i) a $16 million decrease in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization
program due primarily to a decrease in our average outstanding borrowings as well as a decrease in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities, as discussed below; (ii) a $6 million decrease in amortization and
financing fees, resulting primarily from the write-off of certain deferred financing costs and original issue discounts in connection with the financing transactions during the third quarter of 2014, as discussed above, partially offset by;
(iii) $5 million of capitalized interest recorded on major projects during 2013, and; (iv) a $5 million decrease in interest income, primarily related to the interest income received from Illinois during 2013 related to delayed cash
remittances to us.

The aggregate average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan
facilities and accounts receivable securitization program were approximately $3.2 billion during 2014 and approximately $3.5 billion during 2013. The average effective interest rate on these facilities, excluding the amortization of deferred
financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 2.9% during 2014 and 3.1% during 2013. The average effective interest rate on these facilities, including amortization of deferred financing costs and
original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 3.9% during 2014 and 4.2% during 2013.

Interest expense decreased
$33 million during 2013 to $146 million as compared to $179 million during 2012. The decrease was due primarily to: (i) a $21 million decrease in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan
facilities and accounts receivable securitization program due primarily to a decrease in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities, as discussed below; (ii) a $5 million decrease in the amortization of financing
fees, and; (iii) other combined net decrease of $7 million consisting primarily of interest earned by us on delayed cash remittances paid to us from Illinois.

The aggregate average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facilities and accounts
receivable securitization program were approximately $3.5 billion during each of 2013 and 2012. The average effective interest rate on these facilities, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and
designated interest rate swap expense was 3.1% during 2013 and 3.7% during 2012. The average effective interest rate on these facilities, including amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate
swap expense was 4.2% during 2013 and 4.9% during 2012.

Costs Related to Early Extinguishment of Debt

As discussed above, in connection with various financing transactions completed during 2014, as discussed below in

Capital Resources-Credit
Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities,

our 2014 results of operations include a $36 million pre-tax charge incurred for the costs related to the extinguishment of debt. This charge consisted of the write-off of deferred charges ($20
million) and original issue discount on the extinguished debt ($5 million) as well as the make-whole premium paid ($11 million) on the early redemption of the $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes. During 2012, in connection with
the extinguishment of a portion of our previously



outstanding Term Loan-B facility, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $29 million to write-off the related portion of the Term Loan-B deferred financing costs. There were no costs related to early
extinguishment of debt incurred during 2013.

Transaction Costs

There were no material transaction fees incurred in 2014 or 2013. During 2012, we incurred approximately $6 million of transaction costs in
connection with our acquisition of 9 behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012. These costs consisted primarily of legal, investment banking and consulting fees.

Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates

The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of

and one behavioral health care facility. Each of these facilities are owned and operated by limited liability companies (“LLC”) or limited partnerships (“LP”). As a result, since there is no income tax liability incurred at the
LLC/LP level (since it passes through to the members/partners), the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests does not include any income tax provision/benefit. When computing the provision for income taxes, as reflected on our
consolidated statements of income, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is deducted from income before income taxes since it represents the third-party members’/partners’ share of the income generated by the
joint-venture entities. In addition to providing the effective tax rates, as indicated above (as calculated from dividing the provision for income taxes by the income before income taxes as reflected on the consolidated statements of income), we
believe it is helpful to our investors that we also provide our effective tax rate as calculated after giving effect to the portion of our pre-tax income that is attributable to the third-party members/partners.

The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income before income taxes, minus net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (dollar amounts in thousands):

The impact of the discrete tax items did not have a material impact on our provision for income taxes during
2014, 2013 or 2012. The decrease in the effective tax rate during 2014, as compared to 2013 and 2012, was due primarily to: (i) a decrease in our blended effective state income tax rate during 2014; (ii) the income tax



provision recorded during 2013 on the sale of Peak Behavioral Health Services which was divested in May, 2013 (the tax basis gain realized on the sale of Peak Behavioral Health Services exceeded
the gain recorded pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles), and; (iii) a decrease to our federal income tax provision relating to 2013 that was recorded during 2014.

We consider the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014, to be indefinitely reinvested and,
accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon. As of December 31, 2014, the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $12 million.

Discontinued Operations

There were no material divestitures during 2014.

In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) in connection with our acquisition
of Ascend Health Corporation in October of 2012, we agreed to certain conditions, including the divestiture of Peak Behavioral Health Services (“Peak”), a 104-bed behavioral health care facility located in Santa Teresa, New Mexico. The
divestiture of Peak was completed during the second quarter of 2013 for total cash proceeds of approximately $24 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 million which is included in our 2013 consolidated financial statements.

In October of 2012, we completed the divestiture of Auburn Regional Medical Center (“Auburn”), a 159-bed acute care hospital located
in Auburn, Washington, for total cash proceeds of approximately $93 million. This divestiture resulted in a pre-tax gain of $26 million which was included in our 2012 consolidated financial statements.

In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the FTC in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, we agreed to
divest three former PSI facilities (which were divested during 2011) as well as one of our legacy behavioral health facilities in Puerto Rico, which we divested in 2012.

The following table shows the results of operations for Auburn and Peak, on a combined basis, which were reflected as discontinued operations
during our period of ownership for each of the years presented herein (amounts in thousands). Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is not material to our consolidated financial
statements, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses.

Effects of Inflation and Seasonality

Seasonality

—Our acute care services business is typically seasonal, with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in
the first and fourth quarters of the year. This seasonality occurs because, generally, more people become ill during the winter months, which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months.

Inflation

—Inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years. However, since the
healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary



pressures, as are supply and other costs, we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to contain future expense increases. Our ability to pass on
increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. We believe, however,
that through adherence to cost containment policies, labor management and reasonable price increases, the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable.

Capital Resources

Credit Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities

During the third quarter of 2014, we completed the following financing transactions:

•

On August 7, 2014, we entered into a Fourth Amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to our credit agreement dated as of November 15, 2010, as amended on March 15, 2011, September 21, 2012
and May 16, 2013, among UHS, as borrower, the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time parties thereto, as lenders (“Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement, as amended, which is scheduled to mature in August,
2019, consists of: (i) an $800 million revolving credit facility ($140 million of borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2014), and; (ii) a $1.775 billion term loan A facility ($1.764 billion of borrowings outstanding as of
December 31, 2014) which combined our previously outstanding term loan A and term loan A2 facilities which were scheduled to mature in 2016;

•

Repaid $550 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to our previously outstanding term loan B facility which was scheduled to mature in 2016;

•

Increased the borrowing capacity on our existing accounts receivable securitization program (“Securitization”) to $360 million from $275 million, effective August 1, 2014. The Securitization, the terms of
which remain the same as the previous agreement, as discussed below, is scheduled to mature in October, 2016;

•

Issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% senior secured notes due in 2019 (see below for additional disclosure);

•

Issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% senior secured notes due in 2022 (see below for additional disclosure);

•

Redeemed our previously outstanding $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2018 on July 31, 2014 for an aggregate price equal to 104.56% of the principal amount.

In connection with these transactions, our 2014 results of operations included a $36 million pre-tax charge incurred for the costs related to
the extinguishment of debt. This charge consisted of the write-off of deferred charges ($20 million) and original issue discount on the extinguished debt ($5 million) as well as the make-whole premium paid ($11 million) on the early
redemption of the $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either
(1) the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to, at our election: the greatest of (a) the lender’s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month LIBOR rate
plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit and term loan-A borrowings, or (2) the one, two, three or six month LIBOR
rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% for revolving credit and term loan-A borrowings. As of December 31, 2014, the applicable margins
were 0.50% for ABR-based loans, 1.50% for LIBOR-based loans under the revolving credit and term loan-A facilities.

As of
December 31, 2014, we had $140 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to the terms of our $800 million revolving credit facility and we had $640 million of available borrowing capacity, net of $500,000 of outstanding borrowings pursuant to
a short-term, on-demand credit facility and $20 million of outstanding letters of credit. The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain assets of the Company and our
material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.

Pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Amendment to our Credit Agreement,
term loan-A quarterly installment payments of approximately: (i) $11 million commenced during the fourth quarter of 2014 and are scheduled to continue through September, 2016, and; (ii) $22 million are scheduled from the fourth quarter of
2016 through June, 2019. Prior to commencement of the Fourth Amendment, we made scheduled principal payments of $36 million on the term loan-A and term loan A2 facilities during 2014 and $72 million during 2013.



As discussed above, on August 1, 2014, our accounts receivable securitization program
(“Securitization”), with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks which is scheduled to mature in October, 2016, was amended to increase the borrowing capacity to $360 million from $275 million. Substantially all of the
patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals (“Receivables”) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings. We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings. We maintain effective control over the Receivables
since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us. The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used
only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities. The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to
collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks. The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose
entities that securitize the loans. At December 31, 2014, we had $330 million of outstanding borrowings and $30 million of additional capacity pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program.

On August 7, 2014, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”)
and $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Notes”, and together with the 2019 Notes, the “New Senior Secured Notes”). The New Senior Secured Notes were offered only to qualified
institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The New Senior Secured Notes have not been registered
under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. Interest is payable on the New Senior Secured Notes on February 1 and August 1 of
each year to the holders of record at the close of business on the January 15 and July 15 immediately preceding the related interest payment dates, commencing on February 1, 2015 until the maturity date of August 1, 2019 for the
2019 Notes and August 1, 2022 for the 2022 Notes.

On June 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior secured notes which have a
7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016 (the “7.125% Notes”). Interest on the 7.125% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 30th and December 30th of each year. In June, 2008, we issued an additional $150
million of 7.125% Notes which formed a single series with the original 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2006. Other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to and
trade interchangeably with, the 7.125% Notes which were originally issued in June, 2006.

On July 31, 2014, we redeemed the $250
million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes (the “Unsecured Notes”), which were scheduled to mature on October 1, 2018, at a redemption price equal to 104.56% of the principal amount of the Unsecured Notes resulting in a make-whole premium
payment of approximately $11 million. The Unsecured Notes were issued on September 29, 2010 and registered in April, 2011. Interest on the Unsecured Note was payable semiannually in arrears on April 1st and October 1st of each year.

In connection with entering into the previous Credit Agreement on November 15, 2010, and in accordance with the Indenture dated
January 20, 2000 governing the rights of our existing notes, we entered into a supplemental indenture pursuant to which our 7.125% Notes (due in 2016) were equally and ratably secured with the lenders under the Credit Agreement with respect to
the collateral for so long as the lenders under the Credit Agreement are so secured.

The average amounts outstanding during each of years
2014, 2013 and 2012 under the current and prior Credit Agreements, demand notes and accounts receivable securitization programs was $2.4 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, with corresponding interest rates of 1.8%, 2.2% and 2.9%,
respectively, including commitment and facility fees. The maximum amounts outstanding at any month-end were $2.65 billion in 2014, $3.00 billion in 2013 and $3.06 billion in 2012. The effective interest rate on our current and prior Credit
Agreements, accounts receivable securitization programs, and demand notes, which includes the respective interest expense, commitment and facility fees, designated interest rate swaps expense and amortization of deferred financing costs and original
issue discounts, was 3.2% in 2014, 3.6% in 2013 and 4.5% in 2012.



Our Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each
draw. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that include a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens and indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, dividends and stock repurchases; and requires compliance with financial
covenants including maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all required covenants as of December 31, 2014.

The carrying value of our debt at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $3.3 billion. The fair values of our debt at December 31, 2014 and
2013 were $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. The fair value of our debt was computed based upon quotes received from financial institutions. We consider these to be “level 2” in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the
authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with debt instruments.

Our total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was
47% at December 31, 2014 and 51% at December 31, 2013.

We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay
dividends and potentially repurchase shares of our common stock utilizing internally generated and additional funds. Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) the issuance of equity; (ii) borrowings under our existing revolving credit
facility or through refinancing the existing revolving credit agreement, and/or; (iii) the issuance of other long-term debt. We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing capacity under our $800
million revolving credit facility and $360 million accounts receivable securitization program, as well as access to the capital markets, provide us with sufficient capital resources to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the
next twelve months. However, in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to
obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2014 we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds
which totaled $94 million consisting of: (i) $73 million related to our self-insurance programs, and; (ii) $21 million of other debt and public utility guarantees.

Obligations under operating leases for real property, real property master leases and equipment amount to $335 million as of December 31,
2014. The real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near hospital property for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income. We sublease space in these buildings and any amounts received from these subleases are offset
against the expense. In addition, we lease three hospital facilities from the Trust with terms expiring in 2016. These leases contain up to three 5-year renewal options. We also lease the real property of certain facilities as indicated in

Item 2. Properties,

(a)

Reflects borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2014 as discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(b)

Assumes that all debt outstanding as of December 31, 2014, including borrowings under our Credit Agreement, demand note and accounts receivable securitization program, remain outstanding until the final maturity of
the debt agreements at the same interest rates (some of which are floating) which were in effect as of December 31, 2014. We have the right to repay borrowings upon short notice and without penalty, pursuant to the terms of the Credit
Agreement, demand note and accounts receivable securitization program. Also includes the impact of various interest rate swap and cap agreements in effect as of December 31, 2014, as calculated to maturity dates utilizing the applicable
floating interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2014.

(c)

Estimated construction cost of a newly constructed acute care hospital located in Henderson, Nevada. We are required to build this hospital pursuant to an agreement with a third party. In addition to this new hospital
project, we had various other projects under construction as of December 31, 2014 with estimated additional cost to complete and equip of approximately $155 million. Because we can terminate substantially all of the related construction
contracts at any time without paying a termination fee, these costs are excluded from the above table except for the amount contractually committed to a third-party.

(d)

Consists of: (i) $87 million related to long-term contracts with third-parties consisting primarily of certain revenue cycle data processing services for our acute care facilities; (ii) $116 million related to
the future expected costs to be paid to a third-party vendor in connection with the on-going operation of an electronic health records application for each of our acute care facilities, and; (iii) a $2 million liability for physician
commitments expected to be paid in the future.

(e)

Reflects our future minimum operating lease payment obligations related to our operating lease agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2014 as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of
the lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease and our future lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options.

(f)

Consists of $234 million of estimated future payments related to our non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan (estimated through 2089), as disclosed in

Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements

, and
$17 million of estimated future payments related to another retirement plan liability. Included in our other non-current liabilities as of December 31, 2014 was an $11 million liability recorded in connection with the non-contributory, defined
benefit pension plan and included in other non-current liabilities as of December 31, 2014 was a $14 million liability recorded in connection with the other retirement plan.

(g)

Consists of accrued and unpaid estimated claims expense incurred in connection with our commercial health insurer (Prominence Health Plan) and self-insured employee benefit plans.

As of December 31, 2014, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $193 million, of which $51 million
is included in other current liabilities and $142 million is included in other non-current liabilities. We exclude the $193 million for professional and general liability claims from the contractual obligations table because there are no significant
contractual obligations associated with these liabilities and because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments. Please see

Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks

above for additional
disclosure related to our professional and general liability claims and reserves.

In connection with five acute care facilities (and one
additional facility currently under construction) located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain
“put rights” that, if exercisable, and if exercised, require us to purchase the minority member’s interests at fair market value. The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions
falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member’s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds. In
connection with a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and acquired by us as part of the PSI acquisition, the minority ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owner has a “put option” to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time. If exercised, the



put option requires us to purchase the minority member’s interest at fair market value. We exclude the approximate amount that we may be required to pay to repurchase these minority
ownership interests from the contractual obligations table because of the uncertainty as to: (i) whether or not the put rights, if exercisable, will actually be exercised; (ii) the dollar amounts that would be paid if the put rights were
exercised, and; (iii) the timing of such payments.

Additionally, the table above does not include $2 million of the total
unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2014. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for which the amounts may be
utilized.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We manage our
ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate. To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to
exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts. We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) guidance which
requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet. For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships
between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of
forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) within shareholders’ equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings. We use interest rate derivatives
in our cash flow hedge transactions. Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of
the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.

For hedge transactions that do not
qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge’s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly
effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.

The
fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties. We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis. We performed periodic
assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2014 and 2013 and determined the hedges to be highly effective. We also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material
effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows. The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance. However, at December 31, 2014, each swap agreement entered
into by us was in a net liability position which would require us to make the net settlement payments to the counterparties. We do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
trading purposes.

During 2011, we entered into a forward starting interest rate cap on a total notional amount of $450 million from
December, 2011 to December, 2012 reducing to $400 million from December, 2012 to December, 2013 whereby we paid a premium of $740,000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 7.00% and three-month LIBOR if the
three-month LIBOR rate rises above 7.00% during the term of the cap. The three-month LIBOR never reached 7.00% during the term of the cap, which expired in December, 2013, and therefore no payment was made to us.



We also entered into six forward starting interest rate swaps in 2011 whereby we pay a fixed rate
on a total notional amount of $425 million and receive three-month LIBOR. Three of these swaps with a total notional amount of $225 million became effective in March, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015. The average fixed rate payable on these swaps
is 1.91%. The three remaining interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of $75 million, $25 million and $100 million became effective in December, 2011 and had corresponding fixed rates of 1.32%, 1.96% and 2.50%. The $75 million, $25 million,
and $100 million interest rate swaps matured in December, 2012, December, 2013, and December, 2014, respectively.

During 2010, we
entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $600 million and receive three-month LIBOR. Each of the four swaps became effective in December, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015. The
average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 2.38%.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, we entered into two interest rate swaps whereby we
paid a fixed rate on a total notional principal amount of $150 million and received three-month LIBOR. Each of the two interest rate swaps, which are now expired, had an initial notional principal amount of $75 million. The fixed rate payable on one
of the interest rate swaps was 4.87% and it matured in October, 2011. The fixed rate payable on the other interest rate swap, on which the notional principal amount reduced to $50 million in October, 2010, was 4.76% and it matured in October, 2012.

We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on
quotes from banks. We consider those inputs to be “level 2” in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities. The fair value of our
interest rate swaps was a liability of $6 million at December 31, 2014, all of which is included in other current liabilities. At December 31, 2013, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $24 million, of which $19
million was included in other current liabilities and $5 million was included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.

The table below presents information about our long-term financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of
December 31, 2014. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

Control

s and Procedures.

As of
December 31, 2014, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by management on a timely basis in order to comply with our disclosure obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the SEC rules
thereunder.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the fourth quarter of 2014 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over our financial reporting. In order to
evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria on

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework (2013),

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We have excluded the acquisitions made during 2014,
including Cygnet Health Care Limited, Prominence Health Plan and the Psychiatric Institute of Washington, from the assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 because they were acquired by us in purchase
business combinations at various times during 2014. These facilities/businesses represented approximately 6% of our consolidated total assets and 2% of our consolidated net revenues as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2014.

Based on its assessment, management has concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2014, based on criteria in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013),

issued by the COSO. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which appears herein.

Supplemental Financial Statement Schedule II: Valuation and Qualifying Accounts




REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Universal Health Services, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Universal Health Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements,
financial statement schedule, and for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Item 9A as

Management’s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control
over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

, management has excluded Cygnet Health Care
Limited, Prominence Health Plan, and the Psychiatric Institute of Washington, from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 because the entities were acquired by the Company in purchase business
combinations during 2014. We have also excluded Cygnet Health Care Limited, Prominence Health Plan, and the Psychiatric Institute of Washington from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Cygnet Health Care Limited, Prominence
Health Plan, and the Psychiatric Institute of Washington are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total net revenues represent 6% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2014.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1) BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Services provided by our hospitals, all of which are operated by subsidiaries of ours include general and specialty surgery,
internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services. We, through our subsidiaries, provide capital resources as well as a
variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public
relations.

The more significant accounting policies follow:

A) Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries
and partnerships controlled by us or our subsidiaries as the managing general partner. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

B) Revenue Recognition:

We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are
provided. Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 36% of our net patient revenues during 2014, 38% during 2013 and 39% during 2012. Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid
programs accounted for 50% of our net patient revenues during 2014 and 49% during each of 2013 and 2012.

We report net patient service
revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered. We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates.
Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the
related contractual agreements. We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available.
However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.

We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided
data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations. The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least
a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term. Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad
Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements. Such amounts are included in accounts receivable,
net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The vast majority of the net revenues generated at our behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom are derived from government based payors. The funding of both federal Medicare and state
Medicaid programs, and the government based payor programs in the United Kingdom, are subject to legislative and regulatory changes. As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a
material impact on our future government based reimbursements. Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2014, 2013 and 2012. We provide care to patients who meet
certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in
accounts receivable, net. See additional disclosure below in

Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts

for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.



C) Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts:

Collection
of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient’s
responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles. We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience. We routinely review accounts
receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted. At our acute care hospitals, third
party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account. For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives
statements and collection letters. Our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old. All self-pay accounts are
fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge. Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge. Patients that express an inability to pay
are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy. If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection
effort.

Historically, a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured
patients which, in part, has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles. Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than
400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care. The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that
qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.

A portion of the accounts
receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of Medicaid accounts that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states. Our
patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient’s responsible party at the time of registration. At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned. There are
various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered. Certain patients may be classified
as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible. When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending, our patient accounting
system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates, subject to the ultimate disposition of the patient’s Medicaid eligibility. When the patient’s ultimate eligibility
is determined, reclassifications may occur which impacts the reported amounts in future periods for the provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending. Although the patient’s ultimate eligibility determination may
result in amounts being reclassified among these accounts from period to period, these reclassifications did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2014, 2013 or 2012 since our facilities make estimates at each financial
reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.

We also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in
“uninsured discounts” amounts below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our net accounts
receivable. In implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured
discount is applied. Effective January 1, 2014, in response to market conditions and other considerations, we modified our uninsured discount policy and increased the discount to 60% of gross charges from 30% previously. The increase in the
uninsured discount in 2014 had no material impact on our net revenues, net income attributable to UHS or



net accounts receivable, as compared to prior year periods. However, since we expect to collect only a small portion of amounts due from our uninsured patients, this change resulted in an
increase in uninsured discounts and a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts.

On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total
self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience. Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $325 million and $395
million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Uncompensated care (charity care and uninsured discounts):

The following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at
established rates, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012:

The provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals decreased to approximately $590 million during
2014 as compared to $1.02 billion during 2013. The decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts during 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to the increase in the uninsured discount effective January 1, 2014, and reclassifications
among provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending based upon our patients’ ultimate eligibility determination, as discussed above.

The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care:

The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of
operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts. The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute
care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities. An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided
could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.

Our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 include amounts due from Illinois of
approximately $44 million and $49 million, respectively. Collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures. Approximately $23 million as of December 31, 2014 and $28 million
as of December 31, 2013, of the receivables due from Illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date. In addition, our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 includes approximately $102 million
and $62 million due from Texas in connection with Medicaid supplemental payment programs. The $102 million due from Texas as of December 31, 2014 consists of $45 million related to uncompensated care program revenues, $33 million related to
disproportionate share hospital program revenues



and $24 million related to Delivery Service Reform Incentive Payment program (“DSRIP”) revenues. Approximately $24 million of cash was received in January, 2015 from Texas related to
the above-mentioned DSRIP receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Although the accounts receivable due from Illinois and Texas could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due
to us, no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements. However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois and/or Texas. Failure to ultimately collect all
outstanding amounts due from these states would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

D) Concentration of Revenues:

Our five majority owned acute care hospitals in the Las Vegas, Nevada market contributed, on a combined
basis, 14% of our consolidated net revenues during each year of 2014, 2013 and 2012.

E) Accounting for Medicare and Medicaid
Electronic Health Records Incentive Payments:

In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The
regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and established the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The implementation period for these new Medicare and
Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency
model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated “meaningful use” of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final
calculation of the incentive payment is available.

Medicare EHR incentive payments:

Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR
incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable “meaningful use” requirements. Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each
of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31

st

, we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the
“meaningful use” criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.

Medicaid EHR incentive
payments:

Medicaid EHR incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the “meaningful use” criteria. Therefore, the majority of the Medicaid EHR incentive
income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable hospitals were deemed to have met initial “meaningful use” criteria. Upon meeting subsequent fiscal year “meaningful use” criteria, our hospitals may become
entitled to additional Medicaid EHR incentive payments which will be recognized as incentive income in future periods. Medicaid EHR incentive payments received prior to our hospitals meeting the “meaningful use” criteria were included in
other current liabilities (as deferred EHR incentive income) in our consolidated balance sheet.

F) Cash and Cash
Equivalents:

We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

G) Property and Equipment:

Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for renewals and
improvements are charged to the property accounts. Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred. We remove the cost and the related accumulated depreciation from the
accounts for assets sold or retired and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations. Construction-in-progress includes both construction projects and equipment not yet placed into service.

We capitalize interest expense on major construction projects while in progress. There was no capitalized interest recorded during 2014. We
capitalized interest on major construction projects and the development and implementation of electronic health records applications amounting to $4.9 million during 2013 and $5.7 million during 2012.



Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of buildings
and improvements (twenty to forty years) and equipment (three to fifteen years). Depreciation expense (excluding discontinued operations) was $314.5 million during 2014, $285.6 million during 2013 and $270.5 million during 2012.

H) Long-Lived Assets:

We review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash
flow. If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash
flows using appropriate discount rates.

I) Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of
each reporting unit. We have designated September 1

st

as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2014 which indicated no
impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. There were also no impairments during 2013 or 2012. Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could
indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2014 were as follows (in thousands):

(a)

The increase in the Behavioral Health Services’ goodwill consists primarily of an amount that was reclassified from other assets.

(b)

The decrease in the Behavioral Health Services’ goodwill consists primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments.

J) Other Assets:

Other assets consist primarily of amounts related to: (i) intangible assets acquired in connection with
our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (“PSI”) in November, 2010 and Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012, consisting of Medicare licenses, certificates of need and contracts to manage the operations of behavioral health
services owned by third-parties (PSI only); (ii) prepaid fees for various software and other applications used by our hospitals; (iii) costs incurred in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records
application for each of our acute care facilities; (iv) required capital reserves related to our commercial insurer; (v) deposits; (vi) investments in various businesses, including Universal Health Realty Income Trust; (vii) the
invested assets related to a deferred compensation plan that is held by an independent trustee in a rabbi-trust and that has a related payable included in other noncurrent liabilities; (viii) the estimated future payments related to
physician-related contractual commitments, as discussed below, and; (ix) other miscellaneous assets. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $98 million and $97
million, respectively.



K) Physician Guarantees and Commitments:

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our
accrued liabilities-other, and our other assets included $2 million and $3 million, respectively, of estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments. The $2 million of potential future financial obligations outstanding
as of December 31, 2014 are potential 2015 obligations.

L) Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks:

We provide for
self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers’ compensation claims. Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other
things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of
amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies. All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability
for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate. Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each
reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense. See Note 8 for discussion of adjustments to our prior year reserves for claims related to our self-insured general and professional liability and
workers’ compensation liability.

In addition, we also: (i) own a commercial health insurer headquartered in Reno, Nevada, and;
(ii) maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims. The ultimate costs related to these programs/operations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated
expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported. Given our significant insurance-related exposure, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a
material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

M) Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. We believe that future income will enable us
to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.

We operate
in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws. We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities. Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) through the year ended December 31, 2006. We
believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes. See Note 6—

Income Taxes,

for additional disclosure.

N) Other Noncurrent Liabilities:

Other noncurrent liabilities include the long-term portion of our professional and general
liability, workers’ compensation reserves, pension and deferred compensation liabilities, and a liability incurred in connection with split-dollar life insurance agreements on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife.

O) Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interest:

Outside owners hold noncontrolling, minority ownership
interests of: (i) approximately 28% in our five acute care facilities (and one additional facility currently under construction) located in Las Vegas, Nevada; (ii) 20% in an acute care facility located in Washington, D.C.;
(iii) approximately 11% in an acute care facility located in Laredo, Texas, and; (iv) 20% in a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balances of $240 million as of
December 31, 2014 and $218 million as of December 31, 2013, and the noncontrolling interest balances of $55 million as of December 31, 2014 and $50 million as of December 31, 2013, consist primarily of the third-party ownership
interests in these hospitals.

In connection with five acute care facilities (and an additional facility currently under construction)
located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling



interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain “put rights” that, if exercisable, and if exercised, require us to purchase the minority member’s
interests at fair market value. The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a
subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member’s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds. In connection with a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and acquired by us as part
of the PSI acquisition, the minority ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owner has a “put option” to put its entire ownership interest to us at
any time. If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member’s interest at fair market value.

P)
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income:

The accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) component of stockholders’ equity includes: net unrealized gains and losses on effective cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation
adjustments and the net minimum pension liability of a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan which covers employees at one of our subsidiaries. See Note 10, “Pension Plan” for additional disclosure regarding the defined
benefit pension plan.

Q) Accounting for Derivative Financial Investments and Hedging Activities:

We manage our
ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate. To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to
exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.

We account for our
derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair
value on the balance sheet. For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking
each hedge transaction.

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future
cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a
corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) within stockholders’ equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.



We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions. Such derivatives are
designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are
recognized currently in the income statement.

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes
in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of both the
derivative instrument and the hedged item in the income statement.

For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method,
at the hedge’s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash
flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.

R) Stock-Based Compensation:

At
December 31, 2014, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans. Pursuant to the FASB’s guidance, we expense the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation pursuant to the straight-line method
over the stated vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The expense associated with share-based
compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities. The applicable FASB guidance requires
that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized be classified as financing cash flows.

S) Earnings per Share:

Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the year. Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year adjusted to give effect to common stock equivalents.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, for the periods indicated:

The “Net effect of dilutive stock options and grants based on the treasury stock

and 2.0 million during 2012.

T) Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The fair values of our registered debt and
investments are based on quoted market prices. The fair values of other long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are estimated by discounting cash flows using period-end interest rates and market conditions for instruments with similar
maturities and credit quality. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings approximates their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the fair value disclosures included elsewhere in these notes to consolidated financial statements.

U) Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

V) Mergers and Acquisitions:

The acquisition method
of accounting for business combinations requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would
be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Any excess of the
purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The fair value of intangible assets,
including Medicare Licenses, Certificates of Need, and certain contracts, is based on significant judgments made by our management, and accordingly, for significant items we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists.

W) GPO Agreement/Minority Ownership Interest:

During 2013, we entered into a new group purchasing organization agreement
(“GPO”) and acquired a minority interest in the GPO for a nominal amount. In connection with the completion of an initial public offering of the stock of the GPO, during the fourth quarter of 2013, we received cash proceeds for the sale of
a portion of our ownership interest, which were recorded as deferred income and included in liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. The deferred income is being recognized, on a pro rata basis, as a
reduction to our supplies expense over the expected life of the GPO agreement. Also in connection with this GPO agreement and related minority interest ownership, we received shares of restricted stock in the GPO which vest ratably over a
seven-year period, contingent upon our continued participation and minority ownership interest in the GPO. We are recognizing the fair value of this restricted stock, as a reduction to our supplies expense, in our consolidated statements of income
on a pro rata basis over the vesting period.

X)

Provider Taxes:

We incur health-care related taxes (“Provider
Taxes”) imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items or
services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services. Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching
funds as part of their respective state Medicaid programs. We derive a related Medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments. Under
these programs, including the impact of Uncompensated Care and Upper Payment Limit programs, and the Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive program, we earned revenues of approximately $293 million during 2014, $213 million during 2013, and $176
million during 2012. These revenues were offset by



assessments of $137 million during 2014, $84 million during 2013, and $93 million during 2012, resulting in a net aggregate benefit of $156 million, $130 million, and $83 million, respectively.
The aggregate net benefit is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular state’s portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, under various disproportionate share hospital payment programs
and the Nevada state plan amendment program, we earned revenues of $59 million in 2014, $54 million in 2013, and $47 million in 2012.

Y) Recent Accounting Standards:

In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) updated the accounting guidance related to the definition of a
discontinued operation and the related disclosures. The updated accounting guidance defines a discontinued operation as a disposal of a component or a group of components that is to be disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a
strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results. The updated guidance is applicable to us effective January 1, 2015 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this
update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
(“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires additional disclosures. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, “Preparation of Financial Statements—Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure
of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern” (ASU 2014-15). Continuation of a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entity’s
liquidation becomes imminent. Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. If and when an entity’s liquidation becomes imminent, financial statements should be
prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 205-30, “Presentation of Financial Statements—Liquidation Basis of Accounting”. Even when an entity’s liquidation is not imminent, there may be
conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. In those situations, financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going concern basis of accounting, but the new
criteria in ASU 2014-15 should be followed to determine whether to disclose information about the relevant conditions and events. The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual
periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. We will evaluate the going concern considerations in this ASU.

2) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

2015 Acquisition:

In February, 2015, we acquired the Orchard Portman House Hospital (now called Cygnet Hospital-Taunton), a 46-bed behavioral health care
facility located near Taunton, United Kingdom.

Year ended December 31, 2014:

2014 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses:

During 2014 we spent $431 million to:

•

acquire the stock of Cygnet Health Care Limited (“Cygnet”) which consists of 17 facilities located throughout the United Kingdom including 15 inpatient behavioral health hospitals and 2 nursing homes with a
total of 723 beds (during the third quarter);



•

acquire and fund the required capital reserves related to Prominence Health Plan, a commercial health insurer headquartered in Reno, Nevada (during the second quarter);

•

acquire the Psychiatric Institute of Washington, a 124-bed behavioral health care facility and outpatient treatment center located in Washington, D.C. (during the second quarter);

•

acquire the operations of Palo Verde Behavioral Health, a 48-bed behavioral health facility in Tucson, Arizona (during the first quarter);

•

acquire the real property of The Bridgeway, a 103-bed behavioral health care facility located in North Little Rock, Arkansas, that was previously leased from Universal Health Realty Income Trust (during the fourth
quarter);

•

acquire the previously leased real property of Cygnet Hospital-Harrow, a 44-bed behavioral health care facility located in the United Kingdom, the operations of which were acquired as part of our acquisition of Cygnet
(during the fourth quarter), and;

•

acquire physician practices.

The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated
to assets and liabilities based on their preliminary estimated fair values as follows:

Amount

(000s)

Working capital, net

Debt

(16,000

)

Other

Cash paid in 2014 for acquisitions

$

431,000

Goodwill of the facilities acquired is computed, pursuant to the residual method, by deducting the fair value
of the acquired assets and liabilities from the total purchase price. The factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill, which may also influence the purchase price, include the following for each of the acquired facilities: (i) the
historical cash flows and income levels; (ii) the reputations in their respective markets; (iii) the nature of the respective operations, and; (iv) the future cash flows and income growth projections. The vast majority of
the goodwill resulting from these transactions is not deductible for federal income tax purposes (see Note 6. Income Taxes).

Included in our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 was an aggregate of approximately $175 million
representing the net revenues generated at the Cygnet facilities, the commercial health insurer located in Reno, Nevada and the 124-bed behavioral health care facility and outpatient treatment center located in Washington, D.C., from their
respective dates of acquisition through December 31, 2014. The aggregate effect of the earnings generated by these facilities since the dates of acquisition, less the cost on the borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition, was not material
to our 2014 net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share.

Assuming the acquisitions occurred on
January 1, 2014, our 2014 pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $8.28 billion and our pro forma net income attributable to UHS would have been approximately $558 million, or $5.55 per diluted share. Assuming the above-mentioned
acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2013, our 2013 unaudited pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $7.62 billion and our



unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS would have been approximately $522 million and $5.25 per diluted share.

2014 Divestiture of Assets and Businesses:

During 2014 we received $15 million in connection with the divestiture of a non-operating investment (during the first quarter) and the real
property of a closed behavioral health facility (during the second quarter).

Year ended December 31, 2013:

2013 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses:

During 2013, we spent an aggregate of $13 million for the purchase of real property located in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. The aggregate
net purchase price of these properties was allocated to property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet.

2013 Divestiture of
Assets and Businesses:

During 2013, we received an aggregate of $37 million in connection with the divestiture of Peak Behavioral
Health Services (sold during the second quarter of 2013) and certain other assets and real property including three previously closed behavioral health care facilities. As discussed below in

Discontinued Operations

, we agreed to sell Peak
Behavioral Health Services as part of our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation (“Ascend”) in October of 2012. The aggregate pre-tax gain on these divestitures was
approximately $3 million and in included in our 2013 consolidated results of operations.

Year ended December 31, 2012:

2012 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses:

During 2012, we spent $528 million to acquire the following assets and businesses:

•

spent $503 million to acquire nine behavioral health care facilities from Ascend in October, 2012, and;

•

spent $25 million in connection with the acquisition of physician practices and various real property.

The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows:

Goodwill of the facilities acquired is computed, pursuant to the residual method, by deducting the fair value
of the acquired assets and liabilities from the total purchase price. The factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill, which may also influence the purchase price, include the following for each of the acquired facilities:



(i) the historical cash flows and income levels; (ii) the reputations in their respective markets; (iii) the nature of the respective operations, and; (iv) the future cash
flows and income growth projections.

During the period of October 10, 2012 through December 31, 2012, the facilities acquired
from Ascend generated $42 million of net revenues which are included in our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012. The aggregate effect of the earnings generated by these facilities since the date of acquisition, less
the cost on the borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition, and less the above-mentioned transaction costs, was not material to our 2012 net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share. Assuming the
acquisition of Ascend occurred on January 1, 2012, our 2012 unaudited pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $7.11 billion and our unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS and unaudited pro forma net income attributable
to UHS per diluted share would have been $464 million and $4.74 per diluted share, respectively.

2012 Divestiture of Assets and
Businesses:

During 2012, we received $149 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:

•

received $93 million for the sale of Auburn Regional Medical Center (“Auburn”), a 159-bed acute care hospital located in Auburn, Washington (sold in October of 2012);

•

received $50 million for the sale of the Hospital San Juan Capestrano, a 108-bed acute care hospital located in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico (sold in January of 2012 pursuant to our below-mentioned agreement with the FTC in
connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010), and;

•

received an aggregate of $6 million for the sale of the real property of two non-operating behavioral health facilities and our majority ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center located in Puerto Rico.

Included in our 2012 consolidated results of operations was a $26 million pre-tax gain on the divestiture of Auburn. The
divestiture of San Juan Capestrano (in January, 2012) did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations.

Discontinued Operations

There were no material divestitures during 2014.

In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) in connection with our acquisition of
Ascend Health Corporation in October of 2012, we agreed to certain conditions, including the divestiture of Peak Behavioral Health Services (“Peak”), a 104-bed behavioral health care facility located in Santa Teresa, New Mexico. The
divestiture of Peak was completed during the second quarter of 2013 for total cash proceeds of approximately $24 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 million which is included in our 2013 consolidated financial statements.

In October of 2012, we completed the divestiture of Auburn Regional Medical Center (“Auburn”), a 159-bed acute care hospital located
in Auburn, Washington, for total cash proceeds of approximately $93 million. This divestiture resulted in a pre-tax gain of $26 million which was included in our 2012 consolidated financial statements.

In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the FTC in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, we agreed to
divest three former PSI facilities (which were divested during 2011) as well as one of our legacy behavioral health facilities in Puerto Rico, which we divested in 2012.



The following table shows the results of operations for Auburn and Peak, on a combined basis,
which were reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership for each of the years presented herein (amounts in thousands). Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is
not material to our consolidated financial statements, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses.

3) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair Value Hedges:

During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we had no fair value hedges outstanding.

Cash Flow Hedges:

We manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate. To manage
this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts. We account for
our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at
fair value on the balance sheet. For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for
undertaking each hedge transaction.

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in
expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability,
with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) within shareholders’ equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects
earnings. We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions. Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability. For derivative instruments designated as
cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.

For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge’s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal
assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly
effective in the future.

The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on
estimates obtained from the counterparties. We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis. We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2014 and 2013 and determined the hedges to be highly
effective. We also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to



be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows. The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements
expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance. However, at December 31, 2014 and 2013, each swap agreement entered into by us was in a liability position which would require us to make the settlement payments to the counterparties. We
do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

During 2010, we entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $600 million
and receive three-month LIBOR. Each of the four swaps became effective in December, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015. The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 2.38%. We also entered into six forward starting interest rate swaps in 2011
whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $425 million and receive three-month LIBOR. Three of these swaps with a total notional amount of $225 million became effective in March, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015. The average fixed
rate payable on these swaps is 1.91%. The three remaining interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of $75 million, $25 million and $100 million became effective in December, 2011 and had corresponding fixed rates of 1.32%, 1.96% and 2.50%.
The $75 million, $25 million and $100 million interest rate swaps matured in December, 2012, December, 2013 and December, 2014, respectively.

During 2011, we entered into a forward starting interest rate cap, which is now expired, on a total notional amount of $450 million from
December, 2011 to December, 2012 reducing to $400 million from December, 2012 to December, 2013 whereby we paid a premium of $740,000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 7.00% and three-month LIBOR if the
three-month LIBOR rate rises above 7.00% during the term of the cap. The three-month LIBOR never reached 7.00% during the term of the cap, which expired in December, 2013, and therefore no payment was made to us.

We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on quotes
from banks. We consider those inputs to be “level 2” in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities. The fair value of our interest
rate swaps was a liability of $6 million at December 31, 2014, all of which is included in other current liabilities. At December 31, 2013, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $24 million, of which $19 million was
included in other current liabilities and $5 million was included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.

During the third quarter of 2014, we completed the following financing transactions:

•

On August 7, 2014, we entered into a Fourth Amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to our credit agreement dated as of November 15, 2010, as amended on March 15, 2011, September 21, 2012
and May 16, 2013, among UHS, as borrower, the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time parties thereto, as lenders (“Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement, as amended, which is scheduled to mature in August,
2019, consists of: (i) an $800 million revolving credit facility ($140 million of borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2014), and; (ii) a $1.775 billion term loan A facility ($1.764 billion of borrowings outstanding as of
December 31, 2014) which combined our previously outstanding term loan A and term loan A2 facilities which were scheduled to mature in 2016;

•

Repaid $550 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to our previously outstanding term loan B facility which was scheduled to mature in 2016;

•

Increased the borrowing capacity on our existing accounts receivable securitization program (“Securitization”) to $360 million from $275 million, effective August 1, 2014. The Securitization, the terms of
which remain the same as the previous agreement, as discussed below, is scheduled to mature in October, 2016;

•

Issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% senior secured notes due in 2019 (see below for additional disclosure);

•

Issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% senior secured notes due in 2022 (see below for additional disclosure);



•

Redeemed our previously outstanding $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2018 on July 31, 2014 for an aggregate price equal to 104.56% of the principal amount.

In connection with these transactions, our 2014 results of operations included a $36 million pre-tax charge incurred for the costs related to
the extinguishment of debt. This charge consisted of the write-off of deferred charges ($20 million) and original issue discount on the extinguished debt ($5 million) as well as the make-whole premium paid ($11 million) on the early
redemption of the $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either
(1) the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to, at our election: the greatest of (a) the lender’s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month LIBOR rate
plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit and term loan-A borrowings, or (2) the one, two, three or six month LIBOR
rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% for revolving credit and term loan-A borrowings. As of December 31, 2014, the applicable margins
were 0.50% for ABR-based loans, 1.50% for LIBOR-based loans under the revolving credit and term loan-A facilities.

As of
December 31, 2014, we had $140 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to the terms of our $800 million revolving credit facility and we had $640 million of available borrowing capacity, net of $500,000 of outstanding borrowings pursuant to
a short-term, on-demand credit facility and $20 million of outstanding letters of credit. The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain assets of the Company and our
material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.

Pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Amendment to our Credit Agreement,
term loan-A quarterly installment payments of approximately: (i) $11 million commenced during the fourth quarter of 2014 and are scheduled to continue through September, 2016, and; (ii) $22 million are scheduled from the fourth quarter of
2016 through June, 2019. Prior to commencement of the Fourth Amendment, we made scheduled principal payments of $36 million on the term loan-A and term loan A2 facilities during 2014 and $72 million during 2013.

As discussed above, on August 1, 2014, our accounts receivable securitization program (“Securitization”), with a group of
conduit lenders and liquidity banks which is scheduled to mature in October, 2016, was amended to increase the borrowing capacity to $360 million from $275 million. Substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care
hospitals (“Receivables”) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings. We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings. We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization,
the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us. The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special
purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities. The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party
conduit lenders and liquidity banks. The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans. At December 31, 2014, we had
$330 million of outstanding borrowings and $30 million of additional capacity pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program.

On August 7, 2014, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”)
and $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Notes”, and together with the 2019 Notes, the “New Senior Secured Notes”). The New Senior Secured Notes were offered only to qualified
institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The New Senior Secured Notes have not been registered
under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration



requirements. Interest is payable on the New Senior Secured Notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year to the holders of record at the close of business on the January 15 and
July 15 immediately preceding the related interest payment dates, commencing on February 1, 2015 until the maturity date of August 1, 2019 for the 2019 Notes and August 1, 2022 for the 2022 Notes.

On June 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior secured notes which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016 (the
“7.125% Notes”). Interest on the 7.125% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 30th and December 30th of each year. In June, 2008, we issued an additional $150 million of 7.125% Notes which formed a single series with
the original 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2006. Other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to and trade interchangeably with, the 7.125% Notes which were
originally issued in June, 2006.

On July 31, 2014, we redeemed the $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes (the “Unsecured
Notes”), which were scheduled to mature on October 1, 2018, at a redemption price equal to 104.56% of the principal amount of the Unsecured Notes resulting in a make-whole premium payment of approximately $11 million. The Unsecured Notes
were issued on September 29, 2010 and registered in April, 2011. Interest on the Unsecured Note was payable semiannually in arrears on April 1st and October 1st of each year.

In connection with entering into the previous Credit Agreement on November 15, 2010, and in accordance with the Indenture dated
January 20, 2000 governing the rights of our existing notes, we entered into a supplemental indenture pursuant to which our 7.125% Notes (due in 2016) were equally and ratably secured with the lenders under the Credit Agreement with respect to
the collateral for so long as the lenders under the Credit Agreement are so secured.

The average amounts outstanding during each of years
2014, 2013 and 2012 under the current and prior Credit Agreements, demand notes and accounts receivable securitization programs was $2.4 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, with corresponding interest rates of 1.8%, 2.2% and 2.9%,
respectively, including commitment and facility fees. The maximum amounts outstanding at any month-end were $2.65 billion in 2014, $3.00 billion in 2013 and $3.06 billion in 2012. The effective interest rate on our current and prior Credit
Agreements, accounts receivable securitization programs, and demand notes, which includes the respective interest expense, commitment and facility fees, designated interest rate swaps expense and amortization of deferred financing costs and original
issue discounts, was 3.2% in 2014, 3.6% in 2013 and 4.5% in 2012.

Our Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that
must be represented at each draw. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that include a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens and indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, dividends and stock repurchases; and requires
compliance with financial covenants including maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all required covenants as of December 31, 2014.

The carrying value of our debt at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $3.3 billion. The fair values of our debt at December 31, 2014 and
2013 were $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. The fair value of our debt was computed based upon quotes received from financial institutions. We consider these to be “level 2” in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the
authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with debt instruments.

5) COMMON STOCK

Dividends

Cash dividends of $0.30 per share ($29.7 million in the aggregate) were declared and paid during 2014, $.20 per share ($19.6 million in the
aggregate) were declared and paid during 2013 and $.60 per share ($58.4 million in the aggregate), including a $.40 per share special cash dividend ($38.9 million) were declared and paid during 2012. All classes of our common stock have similar
economic rights.

Stock Repurchase Programs

In various prior years, our Board of Directors approved stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our outstanding Class B
Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. In conjunction with the new stock repurchase program discussed below, remaining shares available for repurchase pursuant to prior
authorizations were cancelled.

In July, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program whereby, from time to time
as conditions allow, we may spend up to $400 million to purchase shares of our Class B Common Stock on the open market or in negotiated private transactions. There is no expiration date for our stock repurchase program. Upon approval of the new
stock purchase program, our previously announced stock repurchase program was cancelled. The following schedule provides information related to our stock repurchase program for each of the three years ended December 31, 2014. All of the shares
repurchased during 2013 and 2012 related to income tax withholding obligations resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock grants. No shares were repurchased during 2013 or 2012 pursuant to our publicly announced
stock repurchase program. During 2014, 548,192 shares ($58.0 million in the aggregate) were repurchased pursuant to the terms of our recently authorized stock repurchase program and 480,972 shares ($42.7 million in the aggregate) were repurchased in
connection with income tax withholding obligations resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock grants.

Stock-based Compensation Plans

At December 31, 2014, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans. Pursuant to the FASB’s guidance, we expense the
grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation pursuant to the straight-line method over the stated vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

Pre-tax compensation costs of $29.2 million during 2014, $25.8 million during 2013, and $20.1 million during 2012 were recognized related to
outstanding stock options. In addition, pre-tax compensation costs of $1.9 million during 2014, $2.0 million during 2013 and $2.4 million during 2012 were recognized related to amortization of restricted stock and discounts provided in connection
with shares purchased pursuant to our 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

The expense associated with stock-based compensation
arrangements is a non-cash charge. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, stock-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities and aggregated to $31.1 million in 2014, $27.8
million in 2013 and $22.5 million in 2012. In accordance with ASC 718, excess income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation are classified as cash inflows from financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. During 2014,
2013 and 2012 we generated $33.9 million, $20.1 million and $16.0 million, respectively, of excess income tax benefits related to stock based compensation which are reflected as cash inflows from financing activities in our Consolidated Statements
of Cash Flows, as included herein.

We adopted the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended in 2008 and 2010, (the “Stock Incentive
Plan”) which replaced our Amended and Restated 1992 Stock Option Plan which expired in July of 2005. An aggregate of 23 million shares of Class B Common Stock has been reserved under the Stock Incentive Plan. During 2014, 2013 and 2012,
stock options, net of cancellations, of approximately 2.8 million, 2.6 million and 2.6 million, respectively, were granted. The per option weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2014, 2013 and 2012 was
$17.23, $13.33 and $10.73, respectively. Stock options to purchase Class B Common Stock have been granted to our officers, key employees and members of our Board of Directors. All stock options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair
market value on the date of the grant. Options are exercisable ratably over a four-year period beginning one year after the date of the grant. All outstanding options expire five years after the date of the grant. As of December 31, 2014,
approximately 3.1 million shares of Class B Common Stock remain available for issuance pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan.

The fair
value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were derived from averaging the number of options granted during the most recent five-year period.
The weighted-average assumptions reflected below were based upon twenty-one options grants for the five-year period ending December 31, 2014 and eighteen option grants for each of the five-year periods ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.

The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the
provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (dollar amounts in thousands):

Impacting the effective tax rates during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were favorable discrete tax items of
approximately $1 million recorded during each year to adjust the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions.

The foreign provision
for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $15 million, $6 million, and $38 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. The Company’s consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on undistributed
earnings that the Company does not intend to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Certain of the Company’s undistributed international earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. have a statutory rate
of 21%. As of December 31, 2014, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $10 million of such earnings. The amount of unrecognizable deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be
approximately $4 million.

The assets and liabilities classified as current relate primarily to the allowance for uncollectible patient
accounts, compensation-related accruals and the current portion of the temporary differences related to self- insurance reserves. At December 31, 2014, state net operating loss carryforwards (expiring in years 2015 through 2034), and credit
carryforwards available to offset future taxable income approximated $1.11 billion representing approximately $54 million in deferred state tax benefit (net of the federal benefit). At December 31, 2014, there were foreign net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $7 million expiring through 2022 representing approximately $3 million in deferred foreign tax benefit.

A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Based on
available evidence, it is more likely than not that certain of our state tax benefits will not be realized. Therefore, valuation allowances of approximately $50 million and $44 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2014 and
2013, respectively. During 2014, the valuation allowance on these state tax benefits increased by approximately $6 million due to additional net operating losses incurred. In addition, valuation allowances of approximately $3 million have been
reflected as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 related to foreign net operating losses. There were no significant increases in valuation allowances as a result of the acquisition of Prominence Health Plan, the Psychiatric Institute of Washington
and Cygnet Health Care.

We adopted the provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes effective January 1, 2007. During
2014 and 2013, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were increased less than $1 million due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years. During



2014, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were reduced due to the lapse of the statute of limitations resulting in a net income tax
benefit of approximately $1 million. The balance at each of December 31, 2014 and 2013, if subsequently recognized, that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes is approximately $2 million for each date.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision. As of December 31,
2014 and 2013, we have accrued interest and penalties of less than $1 million as of each date. The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the 2011 and subsequent years. Foreign and U.S. state and local jurisdictions have statutes of
limitations generally ranging for 3 to 4 years. The statute of limitations on certain jurisdictions could expire within the next twelve months. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next 12
months, however, it is anticipated that any such change, if it were to occur, would not have a material impact on our results of operations.

routinely lease equipment pursuant to new lease arrangements that will likely result in future lease and rental expense in excess of amounts indicated above.

8) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Professional and General Liability, Workers’ Compensation Liability and Property Insurance

Professional and General Liability and Workers Compensation Liability:

Effective November, 2010, excluding certain subsidiaries acquired since 2010 as discussed below, the vast majority of our subsidiaries are
self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million and $3 million per occurrence, respectively. Our subsidiaries were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage
in excess of the applicable per occurrence self-insured retention (either $3 million or $10 million) up to $250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for claims incurred in 2014 and up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for
claims incurred from 2011 through 2013. We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.

Since our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (“PSI”) in November, 2010, the former PSI subsidiaries are self-insured for
professional and general liability exposure up to $3 million per occurrence. The nine behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation (“Ascend”) in October, 2012 have general and professional liability policies
through commercial insurance carriers which provide for up to $12 million of aggregate coverage, subject to a $100,000 per occurrence deductible. The 18 facilities acquired from Cygnet Health Care Limited (“Cygnet”), consisting of 16
inpatient behavioral health hospitals and 2 nursing homes, have policies through a commercial insurance carrier located in the United Kingdom that provides for £10 million of professional liability coverage and £25 million of
general liability coverage. The facilities acquired from PSI, Ascend and Cygnet, like our other facilities, are also provided excess coverage through commercial insurance carriers for coverage in excess of the underlying commercial policy
limitations, as mentioned above.

Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number
of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses



for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our
commercial insurance policies. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this
estimate. Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect
on our future results of operations.

As of December 31, 2014, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims
was $193 million, of which $51 million is included in current liabilities. As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $206 million, of which $44 million is included in current liabilities.

We recorded reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $20
million during 2014, $81 million during 2013 and $27 million during 2012. The favorable change recorded during 2014 and 2012 resulted from favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments pursuant to a reserve analysis. The favorable change
in our estimated future claims payments recorded during 2013, relating to years prior to 2013, were due primarily to: (i) an increased weighting given to company-specific metrics (to 100% from 75%), and decreased general industry metrics (to 0%
from 25%), related to projected incidents per exposure, historical claims experience and loss development factors; (ii) historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several
states in which we operate, and; (iii) a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years. As the
number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased, thereby providing for a statistically significant data group, and taking into consideration our long-history of company-specific risk management programs and claims experience, our
reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends.

As of December 31, 2014, the total accrual for our workers’ compensation liability claims was $67 million, of which $32 million is
included in current liabilities. As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our workers’ compensation liability claims was $64 million, of which $34 million is included in current liabilities. The adjustments recorded during the last
three years to our prior year reserves for workers’ compensation claims did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.

Property Insurance:

We
have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence, subject to a $250,000 deductible for the majority of our properties (the properties acquired from
PSI are subject to a $50,000 deductible). Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property. In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering
catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses). Our earthquake limit is $250 million, subject to a deductible of $250,000, except for facilities located
within documented fault zones. Earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the United States are subject to a $100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value
of the property. The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million, subject to a $25,000 deductible. Non-critical flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility. Since certain of our facilities
have been designated by our insurer as flood prone, we have elected to purchase policies from The National Flood Insurance Program to cover a substantial portion of the applicable deductible. Property insurance for the facilities acquired from
Cygnet are provided on an all risk basis up to a £180 million limit that includes coverage for real and personal property as well as business interruption losses.



Legal Proceedings

We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our
hospitals and are party to litigation, as outlined below.

Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) and Other Government
Investigations

In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United
States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) advising of a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (“ICDs”) from 2003 to 2010 at several of our acute
care facilities. The DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a National Coverage Determination regarding these devices. We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In February, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena requesting various documents from
January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. (“UHS”) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and several UHS owned behavioral health facilities including: Keys of Carolina, Old Vineyard Behavioral
Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a, The Pines Residential Treatment
Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health. Prior to receiving this subpoena: (i) the Keys of Carolina and Old Vineyard received notification during the second
half of 2012 from the United States Department of Justice of its intent to proceed with an investigation following requests for documents for the period of January, 2007 to the date of the subpoenas from the North Carolina state Attorney
General’s Office; (ii) Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center received a subpoena in December, 2012 from the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Virginia requesting various documents from July, 2006 to the date of the subpoena, and;
(iii) The Meadows Psychiatric Center received a subpoena from the OIG in February, 2013 requesting certain documents from 2008 to the date of the subpoena. Unrelated to these matters, the Keys of Carolina was closed and the real property was
sold in January, 2013. We were advised that a qui tam action had been filed against Roxbury Treatment Center but the government declined to intervene and the case was dismissed.

In April, 2013, the OIG served facility specific subpoenas on Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting various
documents from January, 2005 to the date of the subpoenas. In July, 2013, another subpoena was issued to Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting additional records. In October, 2013, we were advised by the DOJ’s
Criminal Frauds Section that they received a referral from the DOJ Civil Division and opened an investigation of River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center. Subsequent subpoenas have since been issued to River Point Behavioral Health
and Wekiva Springs Center requesting additional documentation. In April, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) instituted a Medicare payment suspension at River Point Behavioral Health in accordance with federal
regulations which implemented provisions of the Affordable Care Act regarding suspension of payments during certain investigations. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration subsequently issued a Medicaid payment suspension for the facility.
River Point Behavioral Health submitted a rebuttal statement disputing the basis of the suspension and requesting revocation of the suspension. In response, CMS has continued the payment suspension. River Point Behavioral Health has provided
additional information to CMS in an effort to obtain relief from the payment suspension but the suspension remains in effect. In August 2014, we received notification from CMS that, effective September, 2014, the payment suspension was to be
continued for another 180 days. We cannot predict if and/or when the facility’s suspended payments will resume. However, if continued for a significant period of time, the payment suspension will likely have a material adverse effect on River
Point Behavioral Health’s future results of operations and financial condition. The operating results of River Point Behavioral Health did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended
December 31, 2014 or 2013.

In June, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena on Coastal Harbor Health System in Savannah, Georgia requesting
documents from January, 2009 to the date of the subpoena.



In February, 2014, we were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds
Section had been expanded to include the National Deaf Academy. In March, 2014, a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) was served on the National Deaf Academy requesting documents and information from the facility from January 1, 2008
through the date of the CID. We have been advised by the government that the National Deaf Academy has been added to the facilities which are the subject of the coordinated investigation referenced above.

In March, 2014, CIDs were served on Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Streamwood Behavioral Health requesting documents and
information from those facilities from January, 2008 through the date of the CID.

In September, 2014, the DOJ Civil Division advised us
that they were expanding their investigation to include four additional facilities and were requesting production of documents from these facilities. These facilities are Arbour-HRI Hospital, Behavioral Hospital of Bellaire, St. Simons by the Sea,
and Turning Point Care Center.

In December 2014, the DOJ Civil Division requested that Salt Lake Behavioral Health produce documents
responsive to the original subpoenas issued in February, 2013.

The DOJ has advised us that the civil aspect of the coordinated
investigation in connection with the behavioral health facilities named above is a False Claim Act investigation focused on billings submitted to government payers in relation to services provided at those facilities. At present, we are uncertain as
to potential liability and/or financial exposure of the Company and/or named facilities, if any, in connection with these matters.

Matters Relating to Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (“PSI”):

The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of PSI) which were in existence prior to the acquisition
of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010:

Department of
Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:

In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from
the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility. The requested documents were collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination. Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July, 2011 requesting additional documents, which have
also been delivered to the DOJ. All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI’s ownership prior to our acquisition. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the
investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.

Department of
Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital:

In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ
requesting certain information from the facility. Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010. The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ. All documents requested and produced pertained to the
operations of the facility while under PSI’s ownership prior to our acquisition. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in
connection with this matter.

General:

The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare
participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government



action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers.
Currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies. Providers that are found to have
violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to payment suspension, subjected to fines or
penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed
applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including
ours. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with
respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.

The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be
accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it
is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters
specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate;
(ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or;
(vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes. It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.

In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending. In the opinion of management, the
outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In
addition to our long-term debt obligations as discussed in Note 4.

Long-Term Debt

and our operating lease obligations as discussed in Note 7.

Lease Commitments

9) RELATIONSHIP WITH UNIVERSAL HEALTH REALTY INCOME TRUST AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust:

At December 31, 2014, we held approximately 5.9% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the
“Trust”). We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the Trust’s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities.
In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust. Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust
using the equity method of accounting. We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $2.5 million during 2014, $2.4 million during 2013 and $2.1
million during 2012.

Our pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $3.2 million during 2014, $842,000 during 2013 and $1.2 million
during 2012, and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year. Included in our share of the Trust’s income for 2014 and 2012 was approximately $2.3 million in 2014 and $500,000 in 2012 related
to our share of the net favorable impact realized by the Trust in connection with: (i) gains on the sale of medical office buildings (in 2012); (ii) gain on sale of a behavioral health hospital facility (in 2014), and; (iii) gain on
fair value recognition resulting from the Trust’s purchase of minority ownership interests in majority owned limited liability companies (in 2014).

The carrying value of our investment in the Trust was $9.3 million and $8.1 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and is
included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The market value of our investment in the Trust was $37.9 million at December 31, 2014 and $31.5 million at December 31, 2013, based on the closing price of the
Trust’s stock on the respective dates.

Total rent expense under the operating leases on the four hospital facilities with the Trust
(as discussed below) was $16.8 million during 2014, $16.4 million during 2013 and $16.3 million during 2012. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by the Trust or by limited liability
companies in which the Trust holds 100% of the ownership interest.

The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain
properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries. Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional
5-year renewal terms. Each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below. The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter
revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year. The leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.

During the third quarter of 2014, we provided notification to the Trust that, upon the December, 2014 expiration of the The Bridgeway’s
lease term, we intended to exercise our option to purchase the real property of the facility. On December 31, 2014, we purchased The Bridgeway’s real property (a 103-bed behavioral health facility located in North Little Rock, Arkansas)
from the Trust. Pursuant to the terms of the lease, we and the Trust were both required to obtain appraisals of the property to determine its fair market value. Based upon the property appraisals obtained by each party, the purchase price of The
Bridgeway’s real property was approximately $17.3 million.

In addition, we recently constructed two free-standing emergency
departments (“FEDs”) located in Weslaco and Mission, Texas which were completed and opened during the first quarter of 2015. The Trust purchased one of these FEDs from us in January, 2015 and the other in February, 2015. In conjunction
with these sales, wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours, which will operate the FEDs, executed agreements with the Trust to lease the properties for initial terms of 10-years with six, 5-year renewal options. The aggregate construction cost/sales
proceeds of these facilities was approximately $12.8 million and the aggregate rent expense paid to the Trust at the commencement of the leases will approximate $900,000 annually.

Pursuant to the terms of the leases with the Trust, we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing
notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term. In addition, we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same
price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or; (ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer. We also
have the right to purchase the respective leased facilities at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at their appraised fair market value as well as purchase any or all of the three leased hospital properties at their appraised fair market
value upon one month’s notice should a change of control of the Trust occur.

Other Related Party Transactions:

In December, 2010, our Board of Directors approved the Company’s entering into supplemental life insurance plans and agreements on the
lives of our chief executive officer (“CEO”) and his wife. As a result of these agreements, based on actuarial tables and other assumptions, during the life expectancies of the insureds, we would pay approximately $25 million in premiums,
and certain trusts owned by our chief executive officer, would pay approximately $8 million in premiums. Based on the projected premiums mentioned above, and assuming the policies remain in effect until the death of the insureds, we will be entitled
to receive death benefit proceeds of no less than $33 million representing the $25 million of aggregate premiums paid by us as well as the $8 million of aggregate premiums paid by the trusts. During each of 2014 and 2013 we paid approximately $1.3
million in premium payments and during 2012, we paid approximately $1.4 million in premium payments. These agreements did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations during 2014, 2013 or 2012.

A member of our Board of Directors and member of the Executive Committee is Of Counsel to the law firm used by us as our principal
outside counsel. This Board member is also the trustee of certain trusts for the benefit of our CEO and his family. This law firm also provides personal legal services to our CEO.

10) PENSION PLAN

We maintain contributory and non-contributory retirement plans for eligible employees. Our contributions to the contributory
plan amounted to $35.7 million, $29.9 million and $27.3 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The non-contributory plan is a defined benefit pension plan which covers employees of one of our subsidiaries. The benefits are based on years of
service and the employee’s highest compensation for any five years of employment. Our funding policy is to contribute annually at least the minimum amount that should be funded in accordance with the provisions of ERISA.

December 31, 2014 and 2013:

The accumulated benefit obligation was $126.4 million and $102.3 million as of December 31, 2014 and
2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $9.7 million. As of December 31, 2013, the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation by
$4.1 million.



We estimate that there will be a $3.2 million net loss amortized from accumulated other
comprehensive income during 2015.

Investment Policy, Guidelines and Objectives have been established for the defined benefit pension plan. The
investment policy is in keeping with the fiduciary requirements under existing federal laws and managed in accordance with the Prudent Investor Rule. Total portfolio risk is regularly evaluated and compared to that of the plan’s policy target
allocation and judged on a relative basis over a market cycle. The following asset allocation policy and ranges have been established in accordance with the overall risk and return objectives of the portfolio:

In accordance with the investment policy, the portfolio will invest in high quality, large and small
capitalization companies traded on national exchanges, and investment grade securities. The investment managers will not write or buy options for speculative purposes; securities may not be margined or sold short. The manager may employ futures or
options for the purpose of hedging exposure, and will not purchase unregistered sectors, private placements, partnerships or commodities.



11) SEGMENT REPORTING

Our reportable operating segments consist of acute care hospital services and behavioral health care services. The
“Other” segment column below includes centralized services including information services, purchasing, reimbursement, accounting, taxation, legal, advertising, design and construction and patient accounting as well as the operating results
for our other operating entities including outpatient surgery and radiation centers. The chief operating decision making group for our acute care hospital services and behavioral health care services is comprised of our Chief Executive Officer, the
President and the Presidents of each operating segment. The Presidents for each operating segment also manage the profitability of each respective segment’s various facilities. The operating segments are managed separately because each
operating segment represents a business unit that offers different types of healthcare services or operates in different healthcare environments. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. The corporate overhead allocations, as reflected below, are utilized for internal reporting purposes and are comprised of each
period’s projected corporate-level operating expenses (excluding interest expense). The overhead expenses are captured and allocated directly to each segment, to the extent possible, with the non-directly allocated overhead expenses allocated
based upon each segment’s respective percentage of total facility-based operating expenses.

an unfavorable $8.9 million pre-tax impact ($4.9 million, or $.05 per diluted share, net of taxes) recorded in connection with the implementation of EHR applications;

•

a favorable $10.1 million pre-tax impact ($6.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, net of taxes) resulting from the gain realized on the sale of a non-operating investment.

Second Quarter:

•

an unfavorable $7.1 million pre-tax impact ($3.9 million, or $.04 per diluted share, net of taxes) recorded in connection with the implementation of EHR applications.

Third Quarter:

•

an unfavorable $7.9 million pre-tax impact ($4.5 million, or $.04 per diluted share, net of taxes) recorded in connection with the implementation of EHR applications;



•

an unfavorable $36.2 million pre-tax impact ($22.7 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, net of taxes) recorded in connection with the costs related to extinguishment of debt resulting primarily from the early redemption
of our previously outstanding $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in 2018 and the repayment of $550 million of borrowings pursuant to the terms of our previously outstanding Term Loan B facility which was

Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks.

13) SUPPLEMENTAL CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Certain of our senior notes are guaranteed by a group of subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”). The Guarantors, each of
which is a 100% directly owned subsidiary of Universal Health Services, Inc., fully and unconditionally guarantee the senior notes on a joint and several basis, subject to certain customary release provisions.

The following financial statements present condensed consolidating financial data for (i) Universal Health Services, Inc. (on a parent
company only basis), (ii) the combined Guarantors, (iii) the combined non guarantor subsidiaries (all other subsidiaries), (iv) an elimination column for adjustments to arrive at the information for the parent company, Guarantors, and
non guarantors on a consolidated basis, and (v) the parent company and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

Investments in
subsidiaries are accounted for by the parent company and the Guarantors using the equity method for this presentation. Results of operations of subsidiaries are therefore classified in the parent company’s and Guarantors’ investment in
subsidiaries accounts. The elimination entries set forth in the following condensed consolidating financial statements eliminate distributed and undistributed income of subsidiaries, investments in subsidiaries, and intercompany balances and
transactions between the parent, Guarantors, and non guarantors.
