PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

Our principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, surgical
hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers. As of February 28, 2011, we owned and/or operated 25 acute care hospitals and 206 behavioral health centers located in 37 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands. As part of our ambulatory treatment centers division, we manage and/or own outright or in partnerships with physicians, 7 surgical hospitals and surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 5 states and Puerto Rico.

In November, 2010, we completed the acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (“PSI”). PSI was formerly the largest operator
of freestanding inpatient behavioral health care facilities operating a total of 105 inpatient and outpatient facilities in 32 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Net revenues from our acute care hospitals, surgical hospitals, surgery centers and radiation oncology centers accounted for 70% of our
consolidated net revenues in 2010 and 74% in each of 2009 and 2008. Net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities accounted for 30% of our consolidated net revenues during 2010 and 25% during each of 2009 and 2008. The net revenues
generated at the facilities acquired from PSI on November 15, 2010 are included from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2010. Approximately 1% in each of 2009 and 2008 of our consolidated net revenues were recorded in connection with two
construction management contracts pursuant to the terms of which we built newly constructed acute care hospitals for an unrelated third party.

Services provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services,
pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services. We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning,
physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.

We are a Delaware
corporation that was organized in 1979. Our principal executive offices are located at Universal Corporate Center, 367 South Gulph Road, P.O. Box 61558, King of Prussia, PA 19406. Our telephone number is (610) 768-3300.

Our Mission

Our mission and objective is to provide superior healthcare services that patients recommend to families and friends, physicians prefer
for their patients, purchasers select for their clients, employees are proud of, and investors seek for long-term results. To achieve this, we have a commitment to:

•

service excellence

•

continuous improvement in measurable ways

•

employee development

•

ethical and fair treatment

•

teamwork

•

compassion

•

innovation in service delivery

Business Strategy

We believe community-based hospitals will remain
the focal point of the healthcare delivery network and we are committed to a philosophy of self-determination for both the company and our hospitals.

Acquisition of Additional Hospitals.

We selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by acquiring, constructing or leasing additional hospital facilities. We are committed
to a program of rational growth around our core businesses, while retaining the missions of the hospitals we manage and the communities we serve. Such expansion may provide us with access to new markets and new healthcare delivery capabilities. We
also continue to examine our facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities that we believe do not have the potential to contribute to our growth or operating strategy.

Improvement of Operations of Existing Hospitals and Services.

We also seek to increase the operating revenues and
profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services, improvement of existing services, physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls.

We are involved in continual development activities for the benefit of our existing facilities. Applications to state health planning
agencies to add new services in existing hospitals are currently on file in states which require certificates of need, or CONs. Although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our
operations, no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in these efforts.

Quality and Efficiency of
Services.

Pressures to contain healthcare costs and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible. We are
responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services. In addition, in response to cost containment pressures, we continue to implement programs at our facilities designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while
continuing to provide quality care, including more efficient use of professional and paraprofessional staff, monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage, improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more
efficient billing and collection procedures. In addition, we will continue to emphasize innovation in our response to the rapid changes in regulatory trends and market conditions while fulfilling our commitment to patients, physicians, employees,
communities and our shareholders.

In addition, our aggressive recruiting of highly qualified physicians and developing
provider networks help to establish our facilities as an important source of quality healthcare in their respective communities.



2010 Acquisition and Divestiture Activities

Acquisitions:

During 2010, we spent $1.96 billion and assumed $1.08 billion of debt on the acquisition of businesses and real property, including the following:

•

the acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. in November, 2010 for a total purchase price of $3.04 billion consisting of $1.96 billion in cash plus
the assumption of approximately $1.08 billion of PSI’s debt, the majority of which has since been refinanced. PSI was formerly the largest operator of freestanding inpatient behavioral health care facilities operating a total of 105 inpatient
and outpatient facilities in 32 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and;

•

the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of an outpatient surgery center located in Florida in which we previously held a 20% minority
ownership interest. The purchase price consideration in connection with this transaction, which occurred during the first quarter, consisted of acquisition of the net assets less the assumption of the outstanding liabilities and third-party debt.

Divestitures:

During 2010, we received $21 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:

•

the sale of our minority ownership interest in a healthcare technology company;

•

the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center located in Texas, and;

•

the sale of the real property of Methodist Hospital located in Louisiana that was severely damaged and closed in 2005 as a result of Hurricane Katrina.

The PSI Acquisition

In November, 2010, we acquired Psychiatric Solutions Inc. for a total purchase price of $3.04 billion consisting of $1.96 billion in cash plus the assumption of approximately $1.08 billion of PSI’s
debt, the majority of which has since been refinanced, as discussed herein. PSI was formerly the largest operator of freestanding inpatient behavioral health care facilities operating a total of 105 inpatient and outpatient facilities in 32 states,
Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The facilities acquired by us, with an aggregate of approximately 11,500 licensed
beds, offer an extensive continuum of behavioral health programs to critically ill children, adolescents and adults. We also acquired management contracts to manage freestanding behavioral health care inpatient facilities for government agencies and
behavioral health units within certain medical/surgical hospitals owned by third-parties.

Combined with our previously
existing behavioral health care operations, consisting of 101 behavioral health care facilities located throughout the U. S. and Puerto Rico, we believe this acquisition makes us the largest facility-based provider in the behavioral health care
sector. Our increased operating scale may allow us to operate more efficiently and enhance our presence within certain markets. We also believe we can achieve operating expense reductions during the first year following the acquisition primarily
through the elimination of corporate overhead. This acquisition also helps diminish our geographic concentration in certain markets thereby diversifying our overall portfolio and reducing our reliance on one hospital or a cluster of hospitals in a
certain market.

Hospital Utilization

We believe that the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital include the quality and market position of the hospital and the number, quality and specialties of physicians
providing patient care within the facility. Generally, we believe that the ability of a hospital to meet the health care needs of its



community is determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that affect utilization include
general and local economic conditions, market penetration of managed care programs, the degree of outpatient use, the availability of reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and demographic changes such as the growth in local
populations. Utilization across the industry also is being affected by improvements in clinical practice, medical technology and pharmacology. Current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in
reimbursement policies of third party payors. We are also unable to predict the extent to which these industry trends will continue or accelerate. In addition, hospital operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, such as higher patient
volumes and net patient service revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year.

The following table sets forth certain
operating statistics for hospitals operated by us for the years indicated. Accordingly, information related to hospitals acquired during the five-year period has been included from the respective dates of acquisition, and information related to
hospitals divested during the five year period has been included up to the respective dates of divestiture. Information related to the behavioral health care facilities acquired by us in connection with our acquisition of PSI is included for the
period of November 16, 2010 through December 31, 2010, excluding the 3 former PSI facilities that are reflected as discontinued operations, as discussed herein. The licensed and available beds for those facilities are included in 2010 on a
weighted average basis for the period owned.

(1)

Central Montgomery Medical Center located in Pennsylvania was divested during the fourth quarter of 2008. The statistical information for these facilities is included
in the above information through the divestiture date.

(2)

“Average Available Beds” is the number of beds which are actually in service at any given time for immediate patient use with the necessary equipment and
staff available for patient care. A hospital may have appropriate licenses for more beds than are in service for a number of reasons, including lack of demand, incomplete construction, and anticipation of future needs

(3)

“Patient Days” is the sum of all patients for the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient.

(4)

“Occupancy Rate” is calculated by dividing average patient days (total patient days divided by the total number of days in the period) by the number of
average beds, either available or licensed.



Sources of Revenue

We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare
program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients. See

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Sources of Revenue

for additional
disclosure. Other information related to our revenues, income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements,

Segment Reporting.

Regulation and Other Factors

Overview:

The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure
and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse provisions (including, but not limited to, federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and
other illegal inducements to potential referral sources, false claims submitted to federal health care programs and self-referrals by physicians). Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from
participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. Although we believe our policies, procedures and
practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions, or that we would not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties if so subjected. Even if we
were to ultimately prevail, a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us.

Licensing, Certification and Accreditation:

All of our hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local statutes and regulations and receive periodic inspection by
state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care, equipment and cleanliness. Our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal, state and local health agencies, as well as the
requirements of municipal building codes, health codes and local fire departments. Various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment.

All of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by the Joint Commission. All of our acute care hospitals and most of our
behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.

If any of our facilities were to lose its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement
from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other payors. Although we believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards, please see
Item

1A. Risk Factors

of this Report for disclosure regarding ongoing matters with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the California Department of Public Health in connection with our Southwest Healthcare System. The
requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services in the future, which could have
a material adverse impact on operations.

Certificates of Need:

Many of the states in which we operate hospitals
have enacted certificates of need (“CON”) laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services. Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our
inability to complete an acquisition, expansion or replacement, the imposition of civil or, in some cases, criminal sanctions, the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility’s license, which could



harm our business. In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services
from review requirements. In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.

Conversion Legislation:

Many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of
not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities. These laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general, advance notification and community involvement. In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation
may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions. Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a
not-for-profit entity sells a health care facility to a for-profit entity. The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of
not-for-profit hospitals.

Utilization Review:

Federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of
facilities by Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services. The law and regulations require Peer Review Organizations (“PROs”) to review the appropriateness of Medicare
and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of diagnosis related group (“DRG”) classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay. PROs may deny payment for
services provided, assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) that a provider that is in substantial non-compliance with the standards of the PRO be excluded from
participating in the Medicare program. We have contracted with PROs in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews.

Audits:

Most hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of Medicare and Medicaid program submitted claims. If these audits identify overpayments, we could be
required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years’ payments subject to various administrative appeal rights. The federal government contracts with third-party “recovery audit contractors” (“RACs”) and “Medicaid
integrity contractors” (“MICs”), on a contingent fee basis, to audit the propriety of payments to Medicare and Medicaid providers. Permanent RAC audits were created by Section 302 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 and
required the secretary to expand the program to all 50 states by no later than 2010. Similarly, Medicare zone program integrity contractors (“ZPICs”) target claims for potential fraud and abuse. Additionally, Medicare administrative
contractors (“MACs”) must ensure they pay the right amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers. We have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of federal healthcare
payments during the last three years with no material overpayments identified. However, potential liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves, and any excess could potentially be
substantial. Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations also provide for withholding Medicare and Medicaid overpayments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash flow.

Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation

The Stark Law:

The Social Security Act includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities
with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception is met. These types of referrals are known as “self-referrals.” Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include civil penalties up to
$15,000 for each violation, up to $100,000 for sham arrangements, up to $10,000 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal health care programs. There are a number of exceptions to the self-referral
prohibition, including an exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit, service or subpart. However, federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of
hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities. There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial



arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements.

We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or
exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Nonetheless, because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements
with physicians violate the Stark Law.

Anti-kickback Statute:

A provision of the Social Security Act known as the
“anti-kickback statute” prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using, referring, ordering,
recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state health care program. However, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation; one is no
longer required to “have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of” the anti-kickback statute in order to be found guilty of violating such law.

The anti-kickback statute contains certain exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) has issued regulations that provide for
“safe harbors,” from the federal anti-kickback statute for various activities. These activities, which must meet certain requirements, include (but are not limited to) the following: investment interests, space rental, equipment rental,
practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care
arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services. The fact that conduct or a
business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti- kickback statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased
scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.

Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral
sources have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these
financial arrangements do not violate the anti-kickback statute or other applicable laws. Violations of the anti-kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, however, under 18 U.S.C.
Section 3571, this fine may be increased to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations. Civil money penalties may include fines of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the
remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid.

Similar State Laws:

Many of the states
in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care. These statutes typically
provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure. In many instances, the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes. However, in most cases,
little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws.

These laws and regulations are extremely
complex and, in many cases, we don’t have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation. It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to
allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or
the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws (see “Legal Proceedings”), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and
our business reputation



could suffer significantly. In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may
take or what their impact on us may be.

If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark
Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from
participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs. The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Regulations:

A current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased
use of the federal False Claims Act, and, in particular, actions being brought by individuals on the government’s behalf under the False Claims Act’s qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions. Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals
to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the Federal government.

When a
defendant is determined by a court of law to have violated the False Claims Act, the defendant may be liable for up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 to $11,000 for each
separate false claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act
has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the False Claims Act, eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act also
clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention, as well as the receipt, of overpayments. In addition, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil False Claims Act.
Further, a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court.

Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions:

The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false
claims to Medicare and Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, billing for services without prescribed documentation, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement
and cost report fraud. Like the anti-kickback statute, these provisions are very broad.

Further, the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs, whether or not payments
under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs. HIPAA also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in Medicare. There are civil penalties for prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to billing for medically
unnecessary products or services.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy Requirements:

The
administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims
and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health
information. The privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed. Violations of HIPAA can result in
both criminal and civil fines and penalties.

Compliance with the electronic data transmission standards became mandatory in
October 2003. However, during the following year, HHS agreed to allow providers and other electronic billers to continue to submit pre-HIPAA format electronic claims for periods after October 16, 2003, provided they can show good faith



efforts to become HIPAA compliant. Since this exception expired, we believe that we have been in compliance with the electronic data transmission standards.

We were required to comply with the privacy requirements of HIPAA by April 14, 2003. We believe that we were in material compliance
with the privacy regulations by that date and remain so, as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance. The HIPAA security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative, physical and
technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of patient information. HITECH has since strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information, extended certain HIPAA
provisions to business associates, and created new security breach notification requirements. HITECH has also extended the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a HIPAA violation has occurred. We were required to
comply with the security regulations by April 20, 2005 and believe that we have been in substantial compliance with HIPAA and HITECH requirements to date.

Environmental Regulations:

Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations.
Infectious waste generators, including hospitals, face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste, including civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day of noncompliance, criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day, imprisonment, and
remedial costs. In addition, our operations, as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations. We believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all
state and federal laws.

Corporate Practice of Medicine:

Several states, including Florida, Nevada and Texas, have
laws and/or regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers
that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and
criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These statutes and/or regulations vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the
courts or regulatory agencies. We do not expect these state corporate practice of medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations. Many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and fee-splitting
with physicians. We do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements.

EMTALA:

All of our hospitals are
subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”). This federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under Medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the
hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency, to either stabilize the patient’s condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition. Our obligation to
screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the
hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient’s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program. In addition to any
liabilities that a hospital may incur under EMTALA, an injured patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against
the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that statute.

The federal government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover
situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospital’s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical
conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions. EMTALA does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services; however, CMS has recently announced its intent to issue proposed rulemaking
concerning



the applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively. The government also has expressed its intent to investigate
and enforce EMTALA violations actively in the future. We believe that we operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.

Health Care Industry Investigations:

We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those
arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation. Please see

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

included herein for disclosure related to False Claim Act case against
certain of our behavioral health care facilities located in Virginia and California and a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implementation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators from 2003 to the present at
several of our acute care facilities.

We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and
compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that
are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions, or that we
will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with the investigations. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, the government’s inquiry and/or action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on
our future operating results.

Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened
scrutiny of our operations. It is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible
that our executives and/or managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation and/or named as defendants in private litigation.

Revenue Rulings 98-15 and 2004-51:

In March 1998 and May 2004, the IRS issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals. As
a result of the tax rulings, the IRS has proposed, and may in the future propose, to revoke the tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as
unrelated business taxable income to them. The tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts regarding the tax-exempt or public charity status of a not-for-profit partner or the
characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with not-for-profits.

State Rate Review:

Some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget
review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state. In the aggregate, state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected
our results of operations.

Compliance Program:

Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1998.
Currently, the program’s elements include a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs, and a means for enforcing the
program’s policies.

Since its initial adoption, the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet
the industry’s expectations and our needs. Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and
operational aspects of our business. Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program. Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing, and cost reports,
comprise the bulk of these areas. Financial arrangements with physicians and



other referral sources, including compliance with anti-kickback and Stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training, standardized
documentation requirements, and review and audit.

Medical Staff and Employees

Our facilities had approximately 65,100 employees on December 31, 2010, of whom approximately 49,700 were employed full-time.
Approximately 24,000 of these employees (approximately 19,300 full-time employees) are employed by the facilities acquired by us in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010. Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have
been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals. Typically, physicians are not employees of our hospitals and in a number of our markets may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours. Within our acute care division,
approximately 125 physicians are employed either directly by certain of our facilities or affiliated by group practices structured as 501A corporations. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not
owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. In addition, we employ approximately 250 psychiatrists within our behavioral health division. Each of our hospitals are managed on a day-to-day basis by a managing
director employed by us. In addition, a Board of Governors, including members of the hospital’s medical staff, governs the medical, professional and ethical practices at each hospital.

Approximately 2,100 of our employees at seven of our hospitals are unionized. At Valley Hospital Medical Center, unionized employees
belong to the Culinary Workers and Bartenders Union, the International Union of Operating Engineers and the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”). Nurses and technicians at Desert Springs Hospital are represented by the SEIU.
Registered nurses at Auburn Regional Medical Center located in Washington, are represented by the United Staff Nurses Union, the technical employees are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers, and the service employees are represented
by the SEIU. At The George Washington University Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the SEIU or the Hospital Police Association. Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, certain technicians and therapists, pharmacy assistants, and
some clerical employees at HRI Hospital in Boston are represented by the SEIU. At Pennsylvania Clinical Schools, unionized employees are represented by the District Council 88, American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees—AFL-CIO. At Brooke Glen Behavioral Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the Teamsters and the Northwestern Nurses Association/Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals. We believe that our relations
with our employees are satisfactory.

Competition

The health care industry is highly competitive. In recent years, competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in
the United States due to, among other things, regulatory and technological changes, increasing use of managed care payment systems, cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment. In all of the geographical areas in which we
operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals. In addition, some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may
be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sale and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to us.

In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us. Certain hospitals that are located in the areas served
by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical, surgical and behavioral health services, facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals. The increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities,
outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us.

The number and quality of
the physicians on a hospital’s staff are important factors in determining a hospital’s success and competitive advantage. Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital



admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment. We believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patient’s needs, the quality of
other physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospital’s facilities. We strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional
standards and providing adequate support personnel, technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians.

In addition, we depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals. We compete
with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel. Our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff
nationwide, which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate. In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing
levels. To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may by required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.

Many states in which we operate hospitals have CON laws. The application process for approval of additional covered services, new
facilities, changes in operations and capital expenditures is, therefore, highly competitive in these states. In those states that do not have CON laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state
authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. See “Regulation and Other Factors.”

Our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our
hospitals. Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment. In addition, employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs
through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges. In return, hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients. Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group
health care service purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience. The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies
from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations.

A key element of our growth strategy is
expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets. The competition to acquire hospitals is significant. We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit health care companies, as well as from
not-for-profit entities. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do. We intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth, but may not be successful in
accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms.

Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust

At December 31, 2010, we held approximately 6.2% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income
Trust (the “Trust”). We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the Trust’s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment
opportunities. In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust. Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment
in the Trust using the equity method of accounting. We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $1.8 million during 2010 and $1.6 million during
each of 2009 and 2008. Our pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $1.0 million during 2010, $1.1 million during 2009 and $900,000 during 2008 and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year.
The



carrying value of this investment was $7.3 million and $8.1 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. The market value of this investment was $28.8 million at December 31, 2010 and $25.2 million at December 31, 2009, based on the closing price of the Trust’s stock on the respective dates.

Total rent expense under the operating leases on the hospital facilities with the Trust was $16.2 million during 2010, $16.3 million
during 2009 and $16.1 million during 2008. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds non-controlling ownership interests.

The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our
respective subsidiaries. Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5-year renewal terms. Each lease also provided for additional or
bonus rental, as discussed below. The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year. The leases
with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.

Pursuant to the terms of
the leases with the Trust, we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term. In addition, we have rights of first refusal
to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or; (ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and
for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer. We also have the right to purchase the respective leased facilities at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at the appraised fair
market value. In addition, during 2006, as part of the overall exchange and substitution transaction relating to Chalmette Medical Center (“Chalmette”) which was completed during the third quarter of 2006, as well as the early five year
lease renewals on Southwest Healthcare System-Inland Valley Campus (“Inland Valley”), Wellington Regional Medical Center (“Wellington”), McAllen Medical Center and The Bridgeway (“Bridgeway”), the Trust agreed to amend
the Master Lease to include a change of control provision. The change of control provision grants us the right, upon one month’s notice should a change of control of the Trust occur, to purchase any or all of the four leased hospital properties
at their appraised fair market value purchase price.

The table below details the renewal options and terms for each of our
four hospital facilities leased from the Trust:

(a)

We have four 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2031).

(b)

We have two 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2021) and two 5-year renewal options at fair market value lease rates (2022 through 2031).

(c)

We have two 5-year renewal options at fair market value lease rates (2015 through 2024).

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

We are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, could also impact our business and results of operations.

A significant portion of our revenue is produced by facilities located in Nevada, Texas and California.

Nevada:

We own 6 acute care hospitals and 6 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in

Item 2. Properties

. On a
combined basis, these facilities contributed 23% in 2010, 24% in 2009 and 24% in 2008 of our consolidated net revenues. On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 15% in 2010, 14% in
2009 and 18% in 2008 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. On a pro forma basis, assuming we had completed the acquisition of PSI on January 1, 2010, these facilities contributed 18% in 2010 of
our consolidated net revenues and 10% of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.

Texas:

We own 8 acute care hospitals and 14 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in

Item 2. Properties

. On a
combined basis, these facilities contributed 19% during 2010 and 20% during each of 2009 and 2008, of our consolidated net revenues. On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 15% in
2010, 16% in 2009 and 8% in 2008 of our income from operations after net



income attributable to noncontrolling interest. On a pro forma basis, assuming we had completed the acquisition of PSI on January 1, 2010, these facilities contributed 17% in 2010 of our
consolidated net revenues. and 13% of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.

California:

We own 4 acute care hospitals and 15 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in

Item 2. Properties

. On
a combined basis, these facilities contributed 10% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2010, 2009 and 2008. On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 4% in 2010, 5% in
2009 and 7% in 2008 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. On a pro forma basis, assuming we had completed the acquisition of PSI on January 1, 2010, these facilities contributed 9% in 2010 of
our consolidated net revenues and 6% of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.

The significant portion of our revenues and earnings derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to legislative,
regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in Nevada, Texas and California. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a
disproportionate effect on our overall business results.

Our revenues and results of operations are significantly
affected by payments received from the government and other third party payors.

We derive a significant portion of our
revenue from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and, in some cases, reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare
services. Payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding
restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities. We are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy
changes on our operations. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of, among other things, the substantial deterioration in general economic conditions, the funding requirements from
the federal government’s stimulus package, the War on Terrorism and the relief efforts related to hurricanes and other disasters, may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs. If the rates paid or the scope
of services covered by government payors are reduced, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

On a prospective basis (including the projected revenues generated at the facilities acquired from PSI), we expect to receive a large concentration of our Medicaid revenues from Texas and significant
amounts from Pennsylvania, Illinois, Washington, D.C., Nevada and Virginia. These states, as well as most other states in which we operate, have reported significant budget deficits that have resulted in proposed reductions to Medicaid funding for
2011. We can provide no assurance that reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in these states, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to changes in government reimbursement programs, our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private payors, including
managed care providers, significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals. Private payors, including managed care providers, increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment.

We expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls. Reductions in reimbursement
amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.



A worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States could
materially affect our business and future results of operations.

Our patient volumes, revenues and financial results
depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance, which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets. A continuation or worsening of economic conditions may result in a continued
increase in the unemployment rate which will likely increase the number of individuals without health insurance. As a result, our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes, particularly in less intense, more elective service lines, or
a significant increase in services provided to uninsured patients. These factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes, revenues and operating results.

Our patient revenues and payor mix during the last few years were adversely affected by economic conditions, particularly in certain
markets, such as Nevada, Texas and California, where a significant portion of our revenues are concentrated and unemployment rates remain high. In our acute care business, we experienced net revenue pressures caused primarily by declining commercial
payor utilization and an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients treated at our facilities. We can provide no assurance that these trends will not continue. During 2010, our revenues and payor mix within our acute care
operations have been volatile and are unfavorable compared to the comparable prior year period, making it difficult to predict the results for 2011 or thereafter.

We are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform.

On
March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”). The Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “Reconciliation Act”), which contains a number of
amendments to the PPACA, was signed into law on March 30, 2010. Two primary goals of the PPACA, combined with the Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as the “Legislation”), are to provide for increased access to coverage for
healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.

Although it is expected that as a result of the Legislation there may
be a reduction in uninsured patients, which should reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable, the Legislation makes a number of other changes to Medicare and Medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us. The Legislation
revises reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals. The Legislation provides for
decreases in the annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the market basket update beginning October 1, 2011 for Medicare Part B reimbursable items and services and beginning
October 1, 2012 for Medicare inpatient hospital services. The Legislation will reduce Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in 2014, which would adversely impact the reimbursement we receive under these programs. The
Legislation implements a value-based purchasing program, which will reward the delivery of efficient care. Conversely, certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters; such hospitals may include those
with excessive readmission or hospital-acquired condition rates.

The various provisions in the Legislation that directly or
indirectly affect reimbursement are scheduled to take effect over a number of years. Legislation provisions are likely to be affected by the incomplete nature of implementing regulations or expected forthcoming interpretive guidance, gradual
implementation, future legislation, and possible judicial nullification of all or certain provisions of the Legislation. Further Legislation provisions, such as those creating the Medicare Shared Savings Program and the Independent Payment Advisory
Board, create certain flexibilities in how healthcare may be reimbursed by federal programs in the future. Thus, we cannot predict the impact of the Legislation on our future reimbursement at this time.

The Legislation also contains provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare. The Legislation amends several existing laws,
including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it



easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers. Congress revised the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide
that a person is not required to “have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of” the Anti-Kickback Statute in order to be found guilty of violating such law. The Legislation also provides that any claims for items or
services that violate the Anti-Kickback Statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The Legislation provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to
the federal civil False Claims Act. The Legislation also expands the Recovery Audit Contractor program to Medicaid. These amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable
laws and regulations.

We have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities. These
investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self-referral law. The Legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a “grandfather” clause if the arrangement satisfies certain
requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited, effective immediately, from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital. The Legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon
existing physician-owned hospitals and restricts the ability of physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities.

The impact of the Legislation on each of our hospitals may vary. Because Legislation provisions are effective at various times over the next several years, we anticipate that many of the provisions in the
Legislation may be subject to further revision or judicial nullification. We cannot predict the impact the Legislation may have on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity, or whether we will be able to
successfully adapt to the changes required by the Legislation.

We are required to treat patients with emergency medical
conditions regardless of ability to pay.

In accordance with our internal policies and procedures, as well as the
Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor and/or seeking medical treatment (whether or not such individual is
eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay) to determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition. If it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition, we provide such further medical
examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patient’s medical condition, within the facility’s capability, or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the
treating hospital’s written procedures. Our obligations under EMTALA may increase substantially going forward; CMS has recently announced its intent to issue proposed rulemaking concerning the applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and
the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively. If the number of indigent and charity care patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly, or if regulations expanding our obligations to
inpatients under EMTALA is proposed and adopted, our results of operations will be harmed.

An increase in uninsured and
underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations.

Collection of receivables from third-party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the
portion of the bill that is the patient’s responsibility, which primarily includes co-payments and deductibles. We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix, the agings of the receivables and
historical collection experience. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our
allowances as warranted. Significant changes in business office operations, payor mix, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flow and results of
operations. If we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses, our results of operations will be harmed.



Our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care
providers.

The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals, and other healthcare
providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years. In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals. Some of our competitors
include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sales and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are
not available to us.

In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and
offer a broader range of services than we. The number of inpatient facilities, as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers, many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians, in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased
significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment.

If our competitors are
better able to attract patients, recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities, we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed.

Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.

Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment. As a
result, the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends, in part, on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations
with those physicians. Physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals, and, in a number of our markets, physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. They may terminate their affiliation with us at
any time. If we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards, adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged from referring patients
to our facilities and our results of operations may decline.

It may become difficult for us to attract and retain an adequate
number of physicians to practice in certain of the non-urban communities in which our hospitals are located. Our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to
attract patients to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of
operations.

We depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our
nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other healthcare professionals. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.

The nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other
healthcare providers. This shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel. In addition, in some markets like California,
there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels. To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets, which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net
operating revenues.

We cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of
attracting and retaining talented medical support staff. If our general labor and related expenses increase, we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly. Our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management, nurses and
other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations.



If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer
civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability.

The healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things: hospital billing practices
and prices for services; relationships with physicians and other referral sources; adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services; ownership of facilities; qualifications of medical and support personnel; confidentiality,
maintenance and security issues associated with health-related information and patient medical records; the screening, stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions; certification, licensure and accreditation of our
facilities; operating policies and procedures, and; construction or expansion of facilities and services.

Among these laws
are the federal False Claims Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the federal anti-kickback statute and the provision of the Social Security Act commonly known as the “Stark Law.” These laws, and
particularly the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities,
including employment contracts, leases and professional service agreements. We also provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals. The Office of the Inspector
General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti-kickback statute. A number of our current arrangements, including
financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources, may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the anti-kickback statute. Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti-kickback
statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. We cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti-kickback statute. CMS recently published a Medicare self-referral disclosure
protocol, which is intended to allow providers to self-disclose actual or potential violations of the Stark law. Because there are only a few judicial decisions interpreting the Stark law, there can be no assurance that our hospitals will not be
found in violation of the Stark law or that self-disclosure of a potential violation would result in reduced penalties.

These
laws and regulations are extremely complex, and, in many cases, we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation. In the future, it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could
subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we
have violated one or more of these laws (see

Item 3-Legal Proceedings

), or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or
regulations may take or what their impact on us may be. See

Item 1 Business—Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation

.

If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil
penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. The imposition of such penalties
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We may be subject
to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities.

We are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits, product
liability lawsuits, class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business. Some of these actions may involve large claims, as well as



significant defense costs. We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us. All professional and general liability insurance we
purchase is subject to policy limitations. We believe that, based on our past experience and actuarial estimates, our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals. While we continuously monitor
our coverage, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates. If such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future, or payments of claims exceed our
estimates or are not covered by our insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

We may be
subject to governmental investigations, regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits

The federal False Claims Act
permits private parties to bring qui tam, or whistleblower, lawsuits against companies. Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government.
Because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal, we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware.

In
2009, we agreed to settle a qui tam lawsuit relating to our South Texas Health System after many years of governmental investigations. Some of our subsidiaries operating small behavioral healthcare facilities in Virginia and California are currently
the subject of governmental investigations and, in two cases, a qui tam action in which the government intervened and is charging violations of the False Claims Act. We cannot predict whether we will be the subject of additional investigations or
whistleblower lawsuits. Any determination that we have violated applicable laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us.

If any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation, such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement
under Medicare or Medicaid.

The construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal,
state and local regulation relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection.
Additionally, such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards.

All of our hospitals are deemed certified, meaning that they are accredited, properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the Medicare program. The effect of
maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We believe that all of our healthcare facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local and other relevant
regulations and standards. However, should any of our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from
either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected.

During the third quarter of 2009, Southwest
Healthcare System (“SWHCS”), which operates Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Regional Medical Center in Riverside County, California, entered into an agreement with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(“CMS”). The agreement required SWHCS to engage an independent quality monitor to assist SWHCS in meeting all CMS’ conditions of participation. Further, the agreement provided that, during the last 60 days of the agreement, CMS would
conduct a full Medicare certification survey. That survey took place the week of January 11, 2010.

In April, 2010, SWHCS
received notification from CMS that it intended to effectuate the termination of SWHCS’s Medicare provider agreement effective June 1, 2010. In May, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CMS which abated the termination action
scheduled for June 1, 2010. The agreement is one year in duration and required SWHCS to engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for SWHCS to meet the Medicare conditions of participation. At
the conclusion of the



agreement, CMS will conduct a full certification survey to determine if SWHCS has achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation. During the term of the agreement,
SWHCS remains eligible to receive reimbursements from Medicare for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries.

Also in
April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from the California Department of Public Health (“CDPH”) indicating that it planned to initiate a process to revoke SWHCS’s hospital license. In May, 2010, SWHCS received the formal document
related to the revocation action. In September, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CDPH relating to the license revocation. The terms of the CDPH agreement are substantially similar to those contained in the agreement with CMS. As a result
of the agreement, SWHCS’s hospital license remains in effect pending the outcome of the CMS full certification survey which will occur at the end of the agreement. Pursuant to the results of the CMS full certification survey, which we
anticipate occurring in mid-year, 2011, should SWHCS be deemed to have achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, CDPH shall deem SWHCS’s license to be in good standing. Failure of SWHCS to achieve
substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, pursuant to CMS’s full certification survey, will likely have a material adverse impact on SWHCS’s ability to continue to operate the facilities.

As a result of the matters discussed above, we were not previously permitted to open newly constructed capacity at Rancho Springs Medical
Center and Inland Valley Medical Center. However, in February, 2011, we received permission from CDPH to begin accessing the new capacity. Unrelated to these developments, we expect a competitor to open a newly constructed acute care hospital during
the first quarter of 2011. We are unable to predict the net impact of these developments on SWHCS’s results of operations in 2011 and beyond.

Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center remain fully committed to providing high-quality healthcare to their patients and the communities they serve. We therefore intend to work
expeditiously and collaboratively with both CMS and CDPH in an effort to resolve these matters, although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. Failure to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on us. For the years
ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, SWHCS generated approximately 1.1% and 4.3%, respectively, of our income from operations after income attributable to noncontrolling interest.

We may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisition of PSI or realize the potential benefits of the
acquisition, which could cause an adverse effect on us.

We may not be able to combine successfully the operations of
PSI with our operations, and, even if such integration is accomplished, we may never realize the potential benefits of the acquisition. The integration of PSI with our operations requires significant attention from management and may impose
substantial demands on our operations or other projects. The integration of PSI also involves a significant capital commitment, and the return that we achieve on any capital invested may be less than the return that we would achieve on our other
projects or investments. Any of these factors could cause delays or increased costs of combining PSI with us and could adversely affect our operations, financial results and liquidity.

Our level of indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the acquisition of PSI could adversely affect our ability to raise
additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness.

Our level of indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the acquisition of PSI could adversely affect our ability to raise
additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and could potentially prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness.



In connection with the consummation of our acquisition of PSI, in addition to undertaking a
$250 million offering of notes in September, 2010, we obtained a debt financing commitment of $3.45 billion under a senior credit facility consisting of an $800 million revolving credit facility, a $1.05 billion term loan A facility and a $1.6
billion term loan B facility. The senior credit facility became effective upon closing of the acquisition of PSI, which occurred in November, 2010. We also obtained an amended $240 million accounts receivable securitization facility during 2010
(increased from $200 million).

As of December 31, 2010, after giving effect to the use of proceeds from the various debt
financing sources mentioned above, our total debt was $3.92 billion and we had $577 million of unused borrowing capacity under our senior credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities, after taking into account $71 million of outstanding
letters of credit and $3 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to our short-term, on-demand note.

Subject to the limits
contained in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility, the indenture that governs the notes and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital
expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify. Our leverage could result in unfavorable impact on us, including the following:

•

it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements,
acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;

•

a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be
available for other purposes, including our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;

•

some of our borrowings, including borrowings under the credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest, exposing us to the risk of increased
interest rates;

•

it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less
debt, and;

•

we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is
important to our operations.

Our growth strategy depends, in part, on acquisitions, and we may not be
able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our target criteria. We may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from not-for-profit entities due to regulatory scrutiny.

Acquisitions of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy. We face competition for acquisition candidates
primarily from other for-profit healthcare companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do. Also, suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms.

In addition, many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that affect the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals
to for-profit entities. These laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification and community involvement. In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise
discretionary authority over such transactions. Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a
not-for-profit entity sells a healthcare facility to a for-profit entity. The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation, increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential
purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals, increase our acquisition costs or make it difficult for us to acquire hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria, any of which could adversely affect our growth
strategy and results of operations.



Further, the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of
operations, depending on various factors, including the amount paid for the acquisition, the acquired hospital’s results of operations, allocation of the purchase price, effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases.

We may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire, which could harm our results of operations and
adversely affect our growth strategy.

We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the hospitals that we
acquire with our ongoing operations. We may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals. Integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business,
negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel. In addition, acquisition activity requires transitions from, and the integration of, operations and, usually, information systems that are used by acquired hospitals. In
addition, some of the hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition. If we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire, operate such hospitals
profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals, our results of operations could be harmed.

If
we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities, we could become liable for material obligations.

Hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, liabilities for failure to comply
with applicable laws and regulations. Although we typically attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters, we could experience difficulty
enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of hospitals we acquire. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs and/or resulting damage to a facility’s reputation could harm our business.

Our subsidiary, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and
regulatory actions.

Our subsidiary, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental
investigations and regulatory actions (see

Item 3-Legal Proceedings

).

State efforts to regulate the
construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand.

Many of the states in which we
operate hospitals have enacted Certificates of Need, or CON, laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services. Our failure to obtain necessary state approval could
result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition, expansion or replacement, make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, result in the revocation of a facility’s license or
impose civil or criminal penalties on us, any of which could harm our business.

In addition, significant CON reforms have
been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements. In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements,
but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.

Controls designed to reduce inpatient services
may reduce our revenues.

Controls imposed by third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay,
commonly referred to as “utilization review,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization



review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively
affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are
expected to continue. Although we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position and results of operations.

Fluctuations in our operating results, quarter to quarter earnings and
other factors may result in decreases in the price of our common stock.

The stock markets have experienced volatility
that has often been unrelated to operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and, as a result, there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock. If we
are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future, the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when it
becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized.

In addition to our operating results, many economic and
seasonal factors outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings. These factors include certain of the risks discussed herein, demographic changes, operating
results of other hospital companies, changes in our financial estimates or recommendations of securities analysts, speculation in the press or investment community, the possible effects of war, terrorist and other hostilities, adverse weather
conditions, the level of seasonal illnesses, managed care contract negotiations and terminations, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, or other developments affecting the health care industry.

We are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could
subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price.

As a publicly traded company, we are subject to a
significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update
this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations. For example, we cannot provide assurance that,
in the future, our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We also cannot provide assurance that we
could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that
such assessment will have been fairly stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations,
we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation. If we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our stock price could decline.

Different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
condition.

Generally accepted accounting principles are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied
interpretation by us, our independent registered public accounting firm and the SEC. Such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances. Differences in interpretation of generally accepted
accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.



We continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor. Such increased
costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects.

The cost of
construction materials and labor has significantly increased. As we continue to invest in modern technologies, emergency rooms and operating room expansions, the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the
flow of patient care, we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds. In addition, we have a commitment with an unrelated third party to build a newly constructed facility with a specified minimum number of
beds and services. Although we evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital, such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction
continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained.

The deterioration of credit and
capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed.

We require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for
renovation, expansion, construction and addition of medical equipment and technology. We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We cannot predict, however, whether financing for
our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed, which could harm our business.

To fund all or a portion of our future financing needs, we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate, long-term debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and
accounts receivable securitization program. If any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other
sources of funding. In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain
financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

We depend heavily on key management personnel and the departure of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could harm our business.

The expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of our local hospital management personnel are
critical to the success of our business. The loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or of a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability
to provide efficient, quality healthcare services at our facilities, which could harm our business.

The number of
outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock is subject to potential increases or decreases.

At December 31,
2010, 23,588,743 shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock
under other incentive plans. Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock. To the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of Class B Common Stock, the number of
shares of Class B Common Stock available for trading in the public market place would increase substantially and the holders of Class B Common Stock would own a smaller percentage of that class.



In addition, from time-to-time our Board of Directors approve stock repurchase programs
authorizing us to purchase shares of our Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. Such repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock.
Conversely, as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business, we may from time-to-time issue equity through the sale of stock which would increase the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock.
Based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the market price of our stock, interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash, repurchase or issuance of our stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings
per share.

The right to elect the majority of our Board of Directors and the majority of the general shareholder voting
power resides with the holders of Class A and C Common Stock, the majority of which is owned by Alan B. Miller, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors.

Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, with respect to the election of directors, holders of Class A Common Stock
vote as a class with the holders of Class C Common Stock, and holders of Class B Common Stock vote as a class with holders of Class D Common Stock, with holders of all classes of our Common Stock entitled to one vote per share.

As of March 31, 2010, the shares of Class A and Class C Common Stock constituted 7.5% of the aggregate outstanding shares of
our Common Stock, had the right to elect six members of the Board of Directors and constituted 87.3% of our general voting power. As of March 31, 2010, the shares of Class B and Class D Common Stock (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of
options) constituted 92.5% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect two members of the Board of Directors and constituted 12.7% of our general voting power.

As to matters other than the election of directors, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that holders of Class A,
Class B, Class C and Class D Common Stock all vote together as a single class, except as otherwise provided by law.

Each
share of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote; each share of Class B Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one-tenth of a vote; each share of Class C Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to 100 votes (provided
the holder of Class C Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that holder holds); and each share of Class D Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to ten
votes (provided the holder of Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class D Common Stock that holder holds).

In the event a holder of Class C or Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively,
less than ten times the number of shares of Class C or Class D Common Stock that holder holds, then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of Class C Common Stock, or one-tenth of a vote for every share of Class D Common
Stock, which that holder holds in excess of one-tenth the number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, held by that holder. The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory
evidence that such owner holds ten times as many shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock as Class C or Class D Common Stock, respectively, if such facts are not apparent from our stock records.

Since a substantial majority of the Class A shares and Class C shares are controlled by Mr. Alan B. Miller and members of
his family who are also directors and officers of our company, and they can elect a majority of our company’s directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders, there are
potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of our company.

In addition, because this concentrated control
could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, our business and prospects and the trading price of our securities could be adversely
affected.

ITEM 3.

Legal Proceedings

U.S. v. Marion and UHS:

In late 2007, July, 2008 and January, 2009,
the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) issued a series of subpoenas seeking documents related to the treatment of Medicaid beneficiaries at two of our facilities, Marion Youth Center and
Mountain Youth Academy,. It was our understanding at that time that the OIG was investigating whether claims for reimbursement submitted by those facilities to the Virginia Medicaid program were supported by adequate documentation of the services
provided which could be considered to be a basis for a false claims act violation. In August, 2008, the Office of the Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Virginia issued a subpoena to Keystone Newport News, another of our facilities. It was our
understanding at that time that the Office of Attorney General was investigating whether Keystone Newport News complied with various Virginia laws and regulations, including documentation requirements.

In response to these subpoenas, we produced the requested documents on a rolling basis and we cooperated with the investigations in all
respects. We also met with representatives of the OIG, the Virginia Attorney General, the United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, and the United States Department of Justice Civil Division on several occasions to discuss a
possible resolution of this matter. However, the parties were not able to reach a resolution.

Consequently, in November,
2009, the United States Department of Justice and the Virginia Attorney General intervened in a qui tam case that had been filed by former employees of Marion Youth Center under seal in 2007 against Universal Health Services, Inc. (“UHS”),
and Keystone Marion, LLC and Keystone Education and Youth Services, LLC (“Keystone”). The Department of Justice and the Commonwealth of Virginia filed and served their complaint which, at present, relates solely to the Marion Youth Center.
The complaint originally alleged causes of action pursuant to the federal and state false claims acts, the Virginia fraud statute, and unjust enrichment. The former employees filed a separate amended complaint, alleging employment and retaliation
claims as well as false claim act violations. In April, 2010, the defendants in the lawsuit filed motions to dismiss the claims filed by the government and the former employees. In July, 2010, the court ruled on the motions, granting them in part
and denying them in part. The court has allowed the government to proceed with its claims under the federal and state false claims act and the Virginia fraud statute. In addition, the court has allowed the former employees to proceed with parts of
their employment related and retaliation claims. We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our financial statements. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously against the
government’s and the former employees’ allegations. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in the litigation or that the case will be limited to the Marion Youth Center.

Devore, et. al. v. Keystone Education and Youth Services, LLC:

Alicante School in California was acquired by a subsidiary of ours in October, 2005. Prior to our acquisition, two former employees of the
facility filed a false claim act qui tam action and a gender discrimination/whistleblower claim in Sacramento County Superior Court. The plaintiffs allege that the Alicante School improperly billed subdivisions of the state of California based upon
services provided at the school and that the plaintiffs were discriminated against based upon their gender and as a result of their objection to these practices. In June, 2008, we entered into an agreement with the former owners of the facility
whereby they agreed to defend the case, indemnify us and hold us harmless for any damages that may result from this case. The former owners of the facility had been funding the legal defense of this case since that time. Recently, the court
approved the agreed upon $9.5 million settlement of this matter which we paid to the plaintiffs in January, 2011. Since we have made a demand on the former owners of the facility for repayment, and intend to pursue collection of the $9.5 million
pursuant to the June, 2008 indemnification agreement (although we can provide no assurance that we will collect the entire $9.5 million), the settlement amount and related receivable is reflected in other current assets and other accrued liabilities
on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010.



Martin v. UHS of Delaware:

UHS of Delaware, Inc., a subsidiary, and one of our non-public schools in California operated by one of our subsidiaries have been named
as defendants in a state False Claim Act case in Sacramento County Superior Court. Plaintiffs are a former student and employees of the Elmira School who claim that the UHS Schools in California unlawfully retained public education funding from the
state of California for the operation of these schools but failed to meet state requirements to qualify as a non-public school. Plaintiffs have also claimed that we committed unfair business practices associated with these allegations. We deny
liability and intend to defend this case vigorously. We are presently uncertain as to the legal viability of the claims and are unable to determine the extent of potential financial exposure, if any, at this time.

Wage and Hour Class Actions:

Ethridge v. Universal Health Services et. al:

In June, 2008, we and one of
our acute care facilities, Lancaster Community Hospital, were named as defendants in a wage and hour lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court. This is a purported class action lawsuit alleging that the hospital failed to provide sufficient meal
and break periods to certain employees. In June, 2010 a settlement was reached with the attorneys for the class representative. The settlement was recently approved by the court. The reserve established for the settlement of this matter did not have
a material impact on our 2010 consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Other:

We and/or our subsidiaries are presently involved in three other wage and hour class action cases in California and Tennessee. Two of
those cases have been certified as a class by the California State Superior Court in Alameda County and the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, respectively. At present, we are uncertain as to the extent of potential
financial exposure but do not believe potential settlements or judgments in these cases will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Department of Justice ICD Investigation:

In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) advising of a False Claim Act
investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (“ICDs”) from 2003 to the present at several of our acute care facilities. The DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by
our facilities in contravention of a National Claims Determination regarding these devices. At present, we are uncertain as to the extent of the claims, liability for such claims and potential financial exposure in connection with this matter.

Other Matters

The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications,
and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims
statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers. Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or
accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and
compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that
are inconsistent



with industry practices, including ours. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with
sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material
adverse effect on us.

Southwest Healthcare System:

During the third quarter of 2009, Southwest Healthcare System (“SWHCS”), which operates Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland
Valley Regional Medical Center in Riverside County, California, entered into an agreement with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The agreement required SWHCS to engage an independent quality monitor to assist SWHCS in
meeting all CMS’ conditions of participation. Further, the agreement provided that, during the last 60 days of the agreement, CMS would conduct a full Medicare certification survey. That survey took place the week of January 11, 2010.

In April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from CMS that it intended to effectuate the termination of SWHCS’s Medicare
provider agreement effective June 1, 2010. In May, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CMS which abated the termination action scheduled for June 1, 2010. The agreement is one year in duration and required SWHCS to engage
independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for SWHCS to meet the Medicare conditions of participation. At the conclusion of the agreement, CMS will conduct a full certification survey to determine if SWHCS
has achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation. During the term of the agreement, SWHCS remains eligible to receive reimbursements from Medicare for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries.

Also in April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from the California Department of Public Health (“CDPH”) indicating that it
planned to initiate a process to revoke SWHCS’s hospital license. In May, 2010, SWHCS received the formal document related to the revocation action. In September, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CDPH relating to the license
revocation. The terms of the CDPH agreement are substantially similar to those contained in the agreement with CMS. As a result of the agreement, SWHCS’s hospital license remains in effect pending the outcome of the CMS full certification
survey which will occur at the end of the agreement. Pursuant to the results of the CMS full certification survey, which we anticipate occurring in mid-year, 2011, should SWHCS be deemed to have achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare
conditions of participation, CDPH shall deem SWHCS’s license to be in good standing. Failure of SWHCS to achieve substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, pursuant to CMS’s full certification survey, will likely
have a material adverse impact on SWHCS’s ability to continue to operate the facilities.

As a result of the matters
discussed above, we were not previously permitted to open newly constructed capacity at Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center. However, in February, 2011, we received permission from CDPH to begin accessing the new capacity.
Unrelated to these developments, we expect a competitor to open a newly constructed acute care hospital during the first quarter of 2011. We are unable to predict the net impact of these developments on SWHCS’s results of operations in 2011 and
beyond.

Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center remain fully committed to providing high-quality
healthcare to their patients and the communities they serve. We therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with both CMS and CDPH in an effort to resolve these matters, although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so.
Failure to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on us. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, SWHCS generated approximately 1.1% and 4.3%,
respectively, of our income from operations after income attributable to noncontrolling interest.



Matters Relating to PSI:

The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.) for which we have
assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition of PSI which was completed in November, 2010:

Garden City
Employees’ Retirement System v. PSI:

This is a purported shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States
District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against PSI and the former directors in 2009 alleging violations of federal securities laws. We are uncertain at this time as to potential liability and damages but intend to defend the case
vigorously.

Department of Justice Investigation of Sierra Vista:

In 2009, Sierra Vista Hospital in Sacramento, California learned of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”)
relating to Medicare services provided by the facility. The DOJ ultimately notified the facility that with respect to partial hospitalization and outpatient services, the DOJ believed that the medical record documentation did not
adequately support the claims submitted for reimbursement by Medicare. We recently reached a tentative financial settlement with the DOJ. The reserve established in connection with this matter did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations. As part of that agreement, the facility will be subject to a corporate integrity agreement, the terms of which have not yet been finalized.

Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:

In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility. The requested documents have been collected and provided
to the DOJ for review and examination. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.

Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital:

In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010. The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ and we continue to cooperate with the DOJ with respect to this investigation. At present, we are uncertain as
to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.

Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services Recoupment Claims:

The
Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (“DMAS”) has conducted audits at seven former PSI Residential Treatment Centers operated in the Commonwealth of Virginia to confirm compliance with provider rules under the state’s
Medicaid Provider Services Manual (“Manual”). As a result of those audits, DMAS claims the facilities failed to comply with the requirements of the Manual and has requested repayment of Medicaid payments to those facilities. PSI had
previously filed appeals to repayment demands at each facility which are currently pending.

General:

Currently, and from time to time, some of our other facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive
notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies. If one of our facilities is found to have violated these laws and regulations, the facility may be excluded from



participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for
previously billed patient services. We do not believe that, other than as described above, any such existing action would materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending. In the opinion of management,
the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.



PART II

ITEM 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our Class B Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of our Class A, Class C and Class D Common Stock are not
traded in any public market, but are each convertible into shares of our Class B Common Stock on a share-for-share basis. In November, 2009, we declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend which was paid on
December 15, 2009 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2009. All classes of common stock participated on a pro rata basis and, as required, all references to share quantities and share prices for all periods presented have been
adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.

ITEM 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Our principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers. As
of February 28, 2011, we owned and/or operated 25 acute care hospitals and 206 behavioral health centers located in 37 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As part of our ambulatory treatment centers division, we
manage and/or own outright or in partnerships with physicians, 7 surgical hospitals and surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 5 states and Puerto Rico.

In November, 2010, we completed the acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (“PSI”). PSI was formerly the largest operator of freestanding inpatient behavioral health care facilities
operating a total of 105 inpatient and outpatient facilities in 32 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Net
revenues from our acute care hospitals, surgical hospitals, surgery centers and radiation oncology centers accounted for 70% of our consolidated net revenues in 2010 and 74% in each of 2009 and 2008. Net revenues from our behavioral health care
facilities accounted for 30% of our consolidated net revenues during 2010 and 25% during each of 2009 and 2008. The net revenues generated at the facilities acquired from PSI on November 15, 2010 are included from the date of acquisition through
December 31, 2010. Approximately 1% of our consolidated net revenues in each of 2009 and 2008 were recorded in connection with two construction management contracts pursuant to the terms of which we built newly constructed acute care hospitals
for an unrelated third party.

Services provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine,
obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services. We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our
facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors

This Annual Report contains “forward-looking statements” that reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities.
Forward-looking statements include, among other things, the information concerning our possible future results of operations, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expectations that regulatory developments or other matters will not have a
material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, our competitive position and the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industry in which we operate, and the benefits and synergies to be obtained from our completed and
any future acquisitions, and statements of our goals and objectives, and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,”
“would,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,”
“appears,” “projects” and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results
will be achieved. Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to
differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Such factors include, among other things, the following:

•

our ability to comply with the existing laws and government regulations, and/or changes in laws and government regulations;

•

an increasing number of legislative initiatives have recently been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system
on a national or state level. No assurances can be given that the implementation of these new laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations;



•

possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government programs, including Medicare
or Medicaid;

•

an increase in the number of uninsured and self-pay patients treated at our acute care facilities that unfavorably impacts our ability to
satisfactorily and timely collect our self-pay patient accounts;

•

our ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same, including contracts
with United/Sierra Healthcare and the Healthcare Services Coalition in Las Vegas, Nevada;

•

the outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, false claim act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against
us, including matters as disclosed in

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

;

•

the potential unfavorable impact on our business of continued deterioration in national, regional and local economic and business conditions, including
a continuation or worsening of unfavorable credit market conditions;

•

competition from other healthcare providers, including physician owned facilities in certain markets, including McAllen/Edinburg, Texas, the site of
one of our largest acute care facilities;

•

technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for healthcare;

•

our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor expenses
resulting from a shortage of nurses and other healthcare professionals;

•

demographic changes;

•

our acquisition of PSI: (i) has substantially increased our level of indebtedness which could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to
raise additional capital to fund operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and could potentially prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements related to our indebtedness, and; (ii) will
require us to successfully integrate the operations of PSI with our operations and, even if such integration is accomplished, we may never realize the potential benefits of the acquisition;

•

our ability to successfully integrate and improve our recent acquisitions and the availability of suitable acquisitions and divestiture opportunities;

•

a significant portion of our revenues is produced by facilities located in Nevada, Texas and California making us particularly sensitive to reductions
in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs (which have been proposed for 2011) as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states;

•

our ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms, including borrowed funds, to fund the future growth of our business;

•

some of our acute care facilities continue to experience decreasing inpatient admission trends;

•

our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors and there can be no assurance that failure of the payors
to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;

•

the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published final regulations in July, 2010 implementing the health information technology
(“HIT”) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the
requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The implementation period for these new Medicare and



Medicaid incentive payments starts in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. Our acute care hospitals may qualify for
these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the “meaningful use criteria”. Our acute care facilities are scheduled to implement an EHR application, on a facility-by-facility basis, beginning
in 2011 and ending in 2014, however, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for these incentive payments and, should we qualify, we are unable to quantify the amount of incentive payments we may receive since the amounts is
dependent upon various factors including the implementation timing at each facility. Should we qualify for incentive payments, there may be timing differences in the recognition of the revenues and expenses recorded in connection with the
implementation of the EHR application which may cause material period-to-period changes in our future results of operations. Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the
inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. Although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the EHR standards by 2015, there can be no assurance
that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the HITECH Act;

•

the ability to obtain adequate levels of general and professional liability insurance on current terms;

•

changes in our business strategies or development plans;

•

fluctuations in the value of our common stock, and;

•

other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Southwest Healthcare System:

During the third quarter of 2009, Southwest Healthcare System (“SWHCS”), which operates
Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Regional Medical Center in Riverside County, California, entered into an agreement with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The agreement required SWHCS to engage an
independent quality monitor to assist SWHCS in meeting all CMS’ conditions of participation. Further, the agreement provided that, during the last 60 days of the agreement, CMS would conduct a full Medicare certification survey. That survey
took place the week of January 11, 2010.

In April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from CMS that it intended to
effectuate the termination of SWHCS’s Medicare provider agreement effective June 1, 2010. In May, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CMS which abated the termination action scheduled for June 1, 2010. The agreement is one year
in duration and required SWHCS to engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for SWHCS to meet the Medicare conditions of participation. At the conclusion of the agreement, CMS will conduct a full
certification survey to determine if SWHCS has achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation. During the term of the agreement, SWHCS remains eligible to receive reimbursements from Medicare for services rendered to
Medicare beneficiaries.

Also in April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from the California Department of Public Health
(“CDPH”) indicating that it planned to initiate a process to revoke SWHCS’s hospital license. In May, 2010, SWHCS received the formal document related to the revocation action. In September, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with
CDPH relating to the license revocation. The terms of the CDPH agreement are substantially similar to those contained in the agreement with CMS. As a result of the agreement, SWHCS’s hospital license remains in effect pending the outcome of the
CMS full certification survey which will occur at the end of the agreement. Pursuant to the results of the CMS full certification survey, which we anticipate occurring in mid-year, 2011, should SWHCS be deemed to have achieved substantial compliance
with the Medicare conditions of participation, CDPH shall deem SWHCS’s license to be in good standing. Failure of SWHCS to achieve substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, pursuant to CMS’s full certification
survey, will likely have a material adverse impact on SWHCS’s ability to continue to operate the facilities.



As a result of the matters discussed above, we were not previously permitted to open newly
constructed capacity at Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center. However, in February, 2011, we received permission from CDPH to begin accessing the new capacity. Unrelated to these developments, we expect a competitor to open
a newly constructed acute care hospital during the first quarter of 2011. We are unable to predict the net impact of these developments on SWHCS’s results of operations in 2011 and beyond.

Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center remain fully committed to providing high-quality healthcare to their
patients and the communities they serve. We therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with both CMS and CDPH in an effort to resolve these matters, although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. Failure to resolve
these matters could have a material adverse effect on us. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, SWHCS generated approximately 1.1% and 4.3%, respectively, of our income
from operations after income attributable to noncontrolling interest.

Given these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, as
outlined above, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. We assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting
forward-looking information, except as may be required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

A summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in
Note 1 to the financial statements. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements, including the following:

Revenue recognition:

We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are
provided. Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 38% of our net patient revenues during each of 2010, 2009 and 2008. Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs
accounted for 46% of our net patient revenues during each of 2010, 2009 and 2008.

We report net patient service revenue at
the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered. We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates. Payment
arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related
contractual agreements. We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available. However,
due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.

We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid
payment rules and regulations. The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded



estimates will change by material amounts in the near term. Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare
Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements. Such amounts are included in
accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes. As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and
regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2010, 2009
or 2008. If it were to occur, each 1% adjustment to our estimated net Medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of December 31, 2010, would change our after-tax net income by approximately $1 million.

We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less
than our established rates. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net. Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured
discounts, based on charges at established rates, amounting to $807 million, $671 million and $609 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

At our acute care facilities, Medicaid pending accounts comprise the large majority of our receivables that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other
miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states. Approximately 4% or $33 million as of December 31, 2010 and 6% or $35 million as of December 31, 2009 of our accounts receivable, net, were comprised of Medicaid
pending accounts.

Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient’s responsible
party at the time of registration. At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned. There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the
expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered. Certain patients may be classified as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to
definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible. When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending our patient accounting system records net revenues for the services provided to that patient based upon the
established Medicaid reimbursement rates pending ultimate disposition of the patient’s Medicaid eligibility.

Based on
historical hindsight information related to Medicaid pending accounts, we estimate that approximately 56% or $18 million of the $33 million Medicaid pending accounts receivable as of December 31, 2010 will subsequently qualify for Medicaid
reimbursement. Approximately 56% or $20 million of $35 million total Medicaid pending accounts receivable as of December 31, 2009 subsequently qualified for Medicaid pending reimbursement and were therefore appropriately classified at the
patient’s registration. Additional charity reserves of $15 million during 2010 and $16 million during 2009 were established to cover the Medicaid Pending patients that failed to qualify for the Medicaid program based on historical conversion
rates. Based on general factors as discussed below in

Provision for Doubtful Accounts

, our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible. Such estimated uncollectible
amounts related to Medicaid pending, as well as other accounts receivable payer classifications, are considered when the overall individual facility and company-wide reserves are developed.



Below are the Medicaid pending receivable agings as of December 31, 2010 and 2009
(amounts in thousands):

Provision for Doubtful Accounts:

Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients
is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient’s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles. We
estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and
other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted. At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and
adjustments are posted to the patient account. For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient is sent a series of statements and collection letters. Patients that
express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of assistance including our charity care policy. If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for
additional collection effort. Our accounts receivable are recorded net of established charity care reserves of $99 million as of December 31, 2010 and $61 million as of December 31, 2009.

Uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of at least 20% of total charges. During
the collection process the hospital establishes a partial reserve in the allowance for doubtful accounts for self-pay balances outstanding for greater than 60 days from the date of discharge. All self-pay accounts at the hospital level are fully
reserved if they have been outstanding for greater than 90 days from the date of discharge. Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
Potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay.

On a consolidated
basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, accounts receivable
are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $249 million and $169 million, respectively.

Approximately 93% during
2010, 94% during 2009 and 93% during 2008, of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts, was incurred by our acute care hospitals. Shown below is our payer mix concentrations and related aging of our billed accounts receivable, net of
contractual allowances, for our acute care hospitals as of December 31, 2010 and 2009:

As of December 31, 2010:



As of December 31, 2009:

Self-Insured Risks:

We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional
liability claims and workers’ compensation claims. Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported
incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance
policies. All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could
change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate. Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as
additional expense or as a reduction of expense. Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us
will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

Professional and General Liability Claims

Effective January 1, 2008, most of our subsidiaries became self-insured for professional and general liability
exposure up to $10 million per occurrence (as compared to $20 million per occurrence prior to 2008). Prior to our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, our subsidiaries purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which
provide for coverage in excess of $10 million up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. However, we are liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per
occurrence and in the aggregate.

Prior to our acquisition in November, 2010, the PSI facilities were commercially insured for
professional and general liability insurance claims in excess of a $3 million self-insured retention to a limit of $75 million. PSI utilized its captive insurance company to manage the self-insured retention and that captive insurance
company remains in place after our acquisition of PSI.

Since our acquisition of PSI on November 15, 2010, the former PSI
subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $3 million per occurrence and our legacy subsidiaries (which are not former PSI subsidiaries) are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to
$10 million per occurrence. Effective November, 2010, our subsidiaries (including the former PSI subsidiaries) were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable
per occurrence self-insured retention (either $3 million or $10 million) up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to
$60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.

Upon our acquisition of PSI, we conducted a thorough analysis of PSI’s
claims and related reserves and, with the assistance of an independent third-party actuary, we determined that the aggregate self-insured retention estimate for the pre-acquisition professional and general liability claims amounted to $51 million
which is included in our total accrual as of December 31, 2010, as discussed below.



As of December 31, 2010, the total accrual for our professional and general liability
claims, including the estimated claims related to the facilities acquired from PSI, was $289 million, of which $60 million is included in current liabilities. As of December 31, 2009, the total accrual for our professional and general liability
claims was $266 million, of which $46 million is included in other current liabilities.

Based upon the results of reserve
analyses, we recorded reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $49 million during 2010 and $23 million during 2009. These favorable changes in our estimated future claims
payments were due to: (i) an increased weighting given to company-specific metrics (to 75% from 50%), and decreased general industry metrics (to 25% from 50%), related to projected incidents per exposure, historical claims experience and loss
development factors; (ii) historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate, and; (iii) a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk
specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years. As the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased, thereby providing for a
statistically significant data group, and taking into consideration our long-history of company-specific risk management programs and claims experience, our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general
liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends. Actuarially determined estimates for our 2011 provision for self-insured professional and general liability claims were developed based upon similar metrics
and weighting.

For the years of 1998 through 2001, most of our subsidiaries were covered under commercial insurance policies
with PHICO, a Pennsylvania based insurance company that was placed into liquidation in February, 2002. As a result, although PHICO continued to be liable for claims on our behalf that were related to 1998 through 2001, we began paying the claims
upon PHICO’s liquidation. Since that time, although we preserved our right to receive reimbursement from the PHICO estate, we were not previously able to assess the probability of collection or reasonably quantify our share of the liquidation
proceeds. In January, 2009, a court order from the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania was executed in connection with the partial liquidation of the PHICO estate. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2008, based upon our share of the undisputed
and resolved claims made against the PHICO estate as of a specified date and as approved by the liquidator to the court, we recorded a $10 million reduction to our professional and general liability self-insured claims expense. These liquidation
proceeds were received during the first quarter of 2009.

Based upon the results of workers’ compensation reserves
analyses, we recorded reductions to our prior year reserves for workers’ compensation claims amounting to $4 million during 2010, $7 million during 2009 and $4 million during 2008.

Although we are unable to predict whether or not our future financial statements will include adjustments to our prior year reserves for
self-insured general and professional and workers’ compensation claims, given the relatively unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the factors impacting these reserves as discussed above, it is reasonably likely that our
future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves.



Below is a schedule showing the changes in our general and professional liability and
workers’ compensation reserves during the three years ended December 31, 2010 (amount in thousands):

(a)

Excludes the impact of the $10 million recovery from the liquidation of the PHICO estate, as discussed above.

(b)

General and professional liability amounts for 2009 and 2010 are net of adjustments recoded during each year relating to prior years, as discussed above.

(c)

Workers’ compensation amounts for 2008, 2009 and 2010 are net of adjustments recorded during each year as discussed above.

In addition, we also maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims. The ultimate costs
related to these programs include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.

Property Insurance:

Acute care facilities and legacy behavioral health care facilities

We have
commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence, subject to $250,000 deductible. Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles
between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property. In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as
opposed to per occurrence losses.). Our earthquake limit is $250 million, subject to a deductible of $250,000, except for facilities located within documented fault zones. Earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the
United States are subject to a $100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property. The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million. Flood losses have either a $250,000
or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility.

Behavioral health care facilities acquired in November,

The newly acquired facilities formerly owned by PSI have all risk property coverage with a loss limit of $100 million
with a $25,000 deductible. Earth movement losses, except California, are subject to an annual aggregate loss limit of $100 million with a $50,000 per occurrence deductible. Earthquake coverage in California



is further sub-limited to an annual aggregate loss limit of $50 million with a deductible of 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property. Named windstorms are insured to $100 million
per occurrence but are potentially subject to applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property. Flood losses are subject to an annual aggregate loss limit of $100 million with deductibles ranging from
$50,000 to $100,000. Flood losses that occur in designated high hazard areas are sub-limited to $25 million with a $500,000 deductible.

Due to an increase in property losses experienced nationwide in recent years, the cost of commercial property insurance has increased. As a result, catastrophic coverage for earthquake and flood has been
limited to annual aggregate losses (as opposed to per occurrence losses). Given these insurance market conditions, there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained
by us, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

Long-Lived Assets:

We review
our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to
recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow. If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value
and an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.

Goodwill:

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise. Our judgments regarding the existence of
impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit. We have designated September 1

st

as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2010 which
indicated no impairment of goodwill. Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a
portion or all of our goodwill.

Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount
of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred
tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.

We operate in multiple
jurisdictions with varying tax laws. We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities. Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) through the year ended December 31, 2006. We believe that
adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.

Tax Rates

Results of Operations

The following table summarizes our results of operations, and is used in the discussion below, for the years ended December 31, 2010,
2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in thousands):

Year Ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009:

Net
revenues increased 7% or $366 million to $5.57 billion during 2010 as compared to $5.20 billion during 2009. The increase was attributable to:

•

a $169 million or 3% increase in net revenues generated at our acute care hospitals and behavioral health care facilities owned during both periods
(which we refer to as “same facility”);

•

$227 million of combined behavioral health revenues generated during the period of November 16, 2010 to December 31, 2010 at the facilities
acquired by us from PSI, and;

•

$30 million of other combined net decreases in revenues resulting primarily from decreased revenues earned during 2010 in connection with construction
management contract pursuant to the terms of which we built a newly constructed acute care hospital for an unrelated third party that was completed during the fourth quarter of 2009.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $47 million to $428 million during 2010 as compared to $475 million
during 2009 due to the following:

•

a decrease of $33 million at our acute care facilities, as discussed below in

Acute Care Hospital Services,

exclusive of: (i) the $22
million net favorable effect of the reductions recorded during 2010 and 2009 to our professional and general liability reserves, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

(the amounts attributable to our acute care hospitals were $42 million
in 2010 and $20 million in



2009); (ii) the $5 million net unfavorable effect of the reduction to our workers’ compensation self insurance reserves recorded during 2009 that related to years prior to 2009

,
and; (iii) the unfavorable effect of the $7 million charge recorded during 2010 to write-off certain costs related to an acute care hospital construction project;

•

an increase of $62 million at our behavioral health care facilities as discussed below in

Behavioral Health Services

exclusive of: (i) the
$4 million net favorable effect of the reductions recorded during 2010 and 2009 to our professional and general liability reserves, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

(the amounts attributable to our behavioral health care facilities
were $7 million in 2010 and $3 million in 2009

), and; (ii) the $2 million unfavorable effect of the reduction to our workers’ compensation self insurance reserves recorded during 2009 that related to years prior to 2009;

•

a decrease of $53 million

resulting from the transaction fees incurred during 2010 in connection with our acquisition of PSI;

•

a decrease of $32 million

resulting from an increase in interest expense resulting primarily from the cost of borrowings incurred to finance the
acquisition of PSI;

•

a net increase of $26 million resulting from the reductions recorded during 2010 and 2009 to our professional and general liability reserves, as
discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks ($49 million reduction recorded during 2010 and $23 million reduction during 2009), and;

•

a net decrease of $17 million from other combined net unfavorable changes consisting of: (i) a $9 million decrease resulting from the charge
incurred during 2010 in connection with the previously disclosed split-dollar life insurance agreements entered into during 2010 on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife; (ii) a $7 million decrease resulting from the charge
recorded during 2010 to write-off certain costs related to an acute care hospital construction project; (iii) a $7 million decrease resulting from a reduction to our workers’ compensation self insurance reserves recorded during 2009 that
related to years prior to 2009, and; (iv) a net increase of $6 million from other combined net favorable changes.

Net income attributable to UHS decreased $30 million to $230 million during 2010 as compared to $260 million during 2009 due to the following:

•

the $47 million decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes, as discussed above;

•

an unfavorable change of $2 million in the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests;

•

a favorable change of $19 million resulting from a decrease in the provision for income taxes resulting from the $49 million decrease in pre-tax income
($47 million decrease income from continuing operations and $2 million increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests) and certain other nondeductible items as discussed below in

Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax
Rates

.

Year Ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the Year Ended December 31,
2008:

Net revenues increased 4% or $180 million to $5.20 billion during 2009 as compared to $5.02 billion during 2008. The increase was attributable to:

•

a $182 million or 4% increase in net revenues generated at our acute care hospitals and behavioral health care facilities, on a same facility basis;

•

$22 million of combined increases due primarily to the revenues generated at behavioral health facilities acquired or opened during 2009 and 2008, and;

•

$24 million of other combined net decreases in revenues resulting primarily from decreased revenue earned during 2009 in connection with construction
management contracts pursuant to the terms of which we built two newly constructed acute care hospitals for an unrelated third party.



Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased $118 million to $475
million during 2009 as compared to $357 million during 2008 due to the following:

•

an increase of $52 million at our acute care facilities, as discussed below in

Acute Care Hospital Services,

exclusive of: (i) the
favorable effect of the $26 million reduction recorded during 2009 (the amount attributable to our acute care hospitals) to our professional and general liability and workers’ compensation self insurance reserves relating to years prior to
2009, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

, and; (ii) the $25 million provision for settlement recorded during 2008 in connection with the investigation of our South Texas Health System affiliates (which was settled during 2009);

•

an increase of $33 million at our behavioral health care facilities as discussed below in

Behavioral Health Services

exclusive of: (i) the
favorable effect of the $4 million reduction recorded during 2009 (the amount attributable to our behavioral health facilities) to our professional and general liability and workers’ compensation self-insurance reserves relating to years prior
to 2009, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

;

•

an increase of $30 million resulting from the reduction recorded during 2009 to our professional and general liability and workers’ compensation
self insurance reserves relating to years prior to 2009, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks;

•

a favorable change of $25 million resulting from the provision for settlement recorded during 2008 to establish a reserve in connection with the
government’s investigation of our South Texas Health System affiliates which was settled during 2009;

•

an unfavorable change of $10 million resulting from the reduction to our professional and general liability expense recorded during 2008 in connection
with the liquidation proceeds received from the PHICO estate, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

;

•

a decrease of $12 million from other combined net unfavorable changes.

Net income attributable to UHS increased $61 million to $260 million during 2009 as compared to $199 million during 2008 due to the
following:

•

the $118 million increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes, as discussed above;

•

an unfavorable change of $3 million in the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests;

•

an unfavorable change of $47 million in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from the tax provision on the net increase of $115 million
in income from continuing operations before income taxes, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Also contributing to the increase in the income tax provision was a $4 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded during 2009 in
connection with the settlement of the government’s investigation of our South Texas Health System affiliates, and;

•

an unfavorable change of $7 million resulting primarily from the after-tax gain realized during 2008 on the sale of an acute care hospital.



Acute Care Hospital Services

Year Ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009:

The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities on a same facility basis and is used in the
discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands):

On a same facility basis during 2010, as compared to 2009, net revenues at our acute care hospitals
increased $91 million or 2%. Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $33 million or 9% to $328 million or 8.4% of net revenues during 2010 as compared to $361 million or 9.5% of net revenues during 2009.

Inpatient admissions to these facilities decreased 0.3% during 2010, as compared to 2009, while patient days decreased 0.9%. Adjusted
admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased 1.3% and adjusted patient days increased 0.7% during 2010, as compared to 2009. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.4 days during each of 2010 and 2009. The occupancy
rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 59% during 2010 and 62% during 2009.

On a same facility
basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities increased 1.0% during 2010, as compared to 2009, and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 1.7% during 2010, as compared to 2009.

The decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes at our acute care hospitals during 2010, as compared to 2009, was
due primarily to net revenue pressures experienced throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals. The revenue pressures were caused primarily by declining commercial payor utilization and an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured
patients treated at our facilities. Our acute care facilities located in Texas were also unfavorably impacted by reductions in Medicaid revenues. Also contributing to the decline in income from continuing operations before income taxes at our acute
care facilities were increases in salaries, wages and benefits expense and supplies expense which increased beyond the rate of increase of our acute care revenues.

We continue to experience an increase in uninsured patients throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals which in part, has resulted from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do
not have health insurance. We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined



to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net. Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at
established rates, amounting to $807 million during 2010 and $671 million during 2009. An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and charity care
provided, could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.

The following table summarizes the
results of operations for all our acute care operations during 2010 and 2009. Included in these results, in addition to the same facility results shown above, is: (i) the favorable effect of $42 million recorded during 2010 and $20 million
recorded during 2009 resulting from reductions to our professional and general liability self insurance reserves, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

; (ii) the unfavorable effect of $7 million recorded during 2010 to write-off
certain costs related to an acute care hospital construction project, and; (iii) the favorable effect of $5 million recorded during 2009 resulting from a reduction to our workers’ compensation self insurance reserves (amounts in
thousands):

During 2010, as compared to 2009, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased 2% or $91 million to
$3.90 billion due to an increase in same facility revenues, as discussed above.

Income from continuing operations before
income taxes decreased $23 million to $363 million or 9.3% of net revenues during 2010 as compared to $386 million or 10.1% of net revenues during 2009. The decrease in income before income taxes at our acute care facilities resulted from:

•

a $33 million decrease at our acute care facilities on a same facility basis, as discussed above;

•

an increase of $22 million resulting from the reductions recorded during 2010 ($42 million) and 2009 ($20 million) to our professional and general
liability self-insurance reserves, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

;

•

a decrease of $7 million resulting from the write-off of certain costs during 2010 related to an acute care hospital construction project, and;

•

a decrease of $5 million resulting from a reduction to our workers’ compensation reserves recorded during 2009 that related to years prior
to 2009.



Year Ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the Year Ended December 31,
2008:

The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities on a same facility basis
and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in thousands):

On a same facility basis during 2009, as compared to 2008, net revenues at our acute care hospitals
increased $135 million or 4%. Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased $48 million or 15% to $361 million or 9.5% of net revenues during 2009 as compared to $313 million or 8.5% of net revenues during 2008.

Inpatient admissions to these facilities increased 0.6% during 2009, as compared to 2008, while patient days decreased 1.4%. Adjusted
admissions increased 2.2% and adjusted patient days increased 0.1% during 2009, as compared to 2008. The average length of patient stay at these facilities was 4.4 days during 2009 as compared to 4.5 days during 2008. The occupancy rate, based on
the average available beds at these facilities, was 62% during 2009 and 63% during 2008.

Our same facility net revenues were
favorably impacted by an increase in prices charged to private payors including health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations. On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities increased 1.4%
during 2009, as compared to 2008, and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 3.5% during 2009, as compared to 2008.

In addition to the increase in net revenues, the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes generated by our acute
care facilities during 2009, as compared to 2008, was due primarily to, as a percentage of net revenues:

•

a decrease in salaries, wages and benefits expense (to 38.0% of net revenues during 2009 as compared to 38.3% during 2008) due primarily to a
moderation of increases to salaries and wages due to the increased unemployment rates and general economic conditions as well as staff reductions at certain of our facilities due to decreased patient volumes;

•

a decrease in supplies expense (to 16.2% during 2009 as compared to 16.7% during 2008) due primarily to the cost savings realized from a new group
purchasing agreement that commenced in April, 2008, and;



•

a decrease in other operating expenses (to 18.0% during 2009 as compared to 18.6% during 2008) due primarily to cost-reducing initiatives undertaken at
our facilities as well as the impact of the disinflationary economy which has limited our vendors’ and service providers’ ability to increase their prices.

Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, amounting to $671 million
during 2009 and $609 million during 2008.

The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our acute care
operations during 2009 and 2008. Included in these results, in addition to the same facility results shown above, is: (i) the favorable effect of $26 million recorded during 2009 resulting from the reduction to our professional and general
liability and workers’ compensation self insurance reserves relating to years prior to 2009, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks,

and; (ii) the unfavorable effect resulting from the $25 million provision for settlement recorded
during 2008 to establish a reserve in connection with the government’s investigation of our South Texas Health System affiliates which was settled during 2009 (amounts in thousands):

During 2009, as compared to 2008, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased 4% or $141 million to
$3.81 billion. The increase in net revenues was attributable to:

•

a $135 million increase at same facility revenues, as discussed above, and;

•

a net increase of $6 million resulting from other combined revenue changes.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased $103 million to $386 million or 10.1% of net revenues during 2009 as
compared to $283 million or 7.7% of net revenues during 2008. The increase in income before income taxes at our acute care facilities resulted from:

•

a $48 million increase at our acute care facilities on a same facility basis, as discussed above;

•

an increase of $25 million resulting from the reduction recorded during 2009 to our professional and general liability ($20 million) and workers’
compensation ($5 million) self-insurance reserves relating to years prior to 2009, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

;

•

a favorable change of $25 million resulting from the provision for settlement recorded during 2008 to establish a reserve in connection with the
government’s investigation of our South Texas Health System affiliates which was settled during 2009;

•

$5 million of other combined net increases

Sources of Revenue

Overview:

We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective
Medicaid programs and directly from patients.

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and
ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services. Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services
vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our
control. The percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally



increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare,
Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis. We believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in
the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues.

Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services
under Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions,
deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year. Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from
governmental or business payors and we continue to experience an increase in uninsured and self-pay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts thereby increasing our provision for doubtful accounts and charity care
provided.

Since a significant portion of our revenues are derived from facilities located in Nevada, Texas and California, we
are particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in those states. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could
have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.

The following tables show the approximate percentages of net
patient revenue during the past three years (excludes sources of revenues for all periods presented for divested facilities which are reflected as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements) for: (i) our Acute Care and
Behavioral Health Care Facilities Combined; (ii) our Acute Care Facilities, and; (iii) our Behavioral Health Care Facilities. Net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts
from established billing rates, which we derived from various sources of payment for the years indicated.



Medicare:

Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits
to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental
authorities. Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program,
our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.

Under the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”). Under the IPPS, hospitals are
paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge. The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient’s Medicare severity diagnosis related group (“MS-DRG”). Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the
estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis. The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in
providing care. This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG. The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which
a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity. While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for
an “outlier” payment if a particular patient’s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold.

MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the “hospital market basket index,”
gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services
purchased by hospitals.

In July, 2009, CMS published the final IPPS 2010 payment rule which provided for a 2.1% market basket
increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates and the documenting and coding adjustments were considered, our overall increase from the final federal
fiscal year 2010 rule was approximately 1.1%.

In July, 2010, CMS published its final IPPS 2011 payment rule which provided
for a 2.6% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates and the documenting and coding adjustments are considered, we estimate our
overall decrease from the proposed federal fiscal year 2011 rule will approximate 1.1%. In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by
0.25% in federal fiscal year 2011.

In September, 2007, the “TMA, Abstinence Education, and QI Programs Extension Act of
2007” legislation took effect and scaled back cuts in hospital reimbursement that CMS was set to impose. In federal fiscal years



2010 to 2012, the new law requires CMS to make adjustments to the Medicare standardized amounts in these years to reflect the removal of actual aggregate payment increases or decreases for
documentation and coding adjustments that occurred during federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009 as compared to the initial CMS estimates. In federal fiscal year 2010, CMS made its initial statutory mandated adjustment under this legislation and will
continue to do so in subsequent fiscal years to ensure the implementation of MS-DRGs was budget neutral among all affected hospitals. In July, 2010, the IPPS 2011 proposed payment rule applied a 2.9% reduction to the 2011 market basket update and
indicated another 2.9% reduction would also be applied in 2012 for documenting and coding. In this same rule, CMS indicated a remaining documenting and coding adjustment of 3.9% reduction is still required to be made to future IPPS updates. CMS did
not indicate to which future federal fiscal year(s) this reduction would be applied.

On January 1, 2005, CMS implemented
a new Psychiatric Prospective Payment System (“Psych PPS”) for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program. This system replaced the cost-based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem Psych PPS with
adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics. The Psych PPS also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency
department. According to the May, 2009 CMS notice, the market basket increase was 2.1% for the period of July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010. According to the April, 2010 CMS notice, the market basket increase is 2.4% for the period of
July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011. In January, 2011 CMS published its proposed Psych PPS rule for the fifteen month period July 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012. The market basket increase for this time period is scheduled to be
2.75%, which includes a 0.25% reduction required by the federal Health Care Reform legislation enacted in 2010.

In October
2009, CMS published its annual final Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“OPPS”) rule for 2010. The final market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.1%. When other statutorily required adjustments are considered the
overall Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2010 is estimated to be 1.9%.

In November 2010, CMS published its annual final
Medicare OPPS rule for 2011. The final market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.46%. In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update
factor by 0.25% in federal fiscal year 2011. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, the overall Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2011 is estimated to be 3.2%.

In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published final regulations implementing the health
information technology (“HIT”) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”)
and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria.

The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments starts in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late
as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary and we are unable to predict which states will chose to participate. We estimate
that approximately 75% of the projected incentive payments will be paid by Medicare and 25% from state Medicaid programs. Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they
meet the “meaningful use criteria”. These Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments are intended to offset a portion of the cost incurred to qualify as a meaningful user of EHR. Our acute care facilities are scheduled to implement an EHR
application, on a facility-by-facility basis, beginning in 2011 and ending in 2013. However, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for these incentive payments and, should we qualify, we are unable to quantify the amount of
incentive payments we may receive since the amount is dependent upon various factors including the implementation timing at each facility. Should we qualify for incentive payments, there may be timing differences in the recognition of the revenues
and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of



the EHR application which may cause material period-to-period changes in our future results of operations. Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a
reduced market basket update to the IPPS standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. Although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the EHR standards by 2015, there can be no assurance that all of our
facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the HITECH Act.

Medicaid:

Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or
under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. In addition to revenues received
pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid. All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are
certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.

We receive a large concentration of
our Medicaid revenues from Texas and significant amounts from Nevada, Florida, California, Washington, D.C. and Illinois. The majority of these states, as well as most other states in which we operate, have reported significant budget deficits that
have resulted in the reduction of Medicaid funding for 2009 and 2010. Furthermore, many states are currently working to effectuate further significant reductions in the level of Medicaid funding due to significant state budget deficits also
projected for 2011, which could adversely affect future levels of Medicaid reimbursement received by our hospitals. We can provide no assurance that reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a
material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Conversely, on February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was signed into law and contained various Medicaid provisions that will impact our hospitals
including the following: (i) temporary increases to Medicaid funding through enhanced federal matching assistance percentages (“FMAPs”) for a 27 month period retroactive to October 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010 with all
states receiving a FMAP increase of 6.2% and also receiving a bonus FMAP increase contingent on the increased level of a state’s unemployment rate; (ii) a temporary increase of 2.5% in the federal Medicaid disproportionate share hospital
allotment for both federal fiscal years 2009 and 2010, and; (iii) states will be required to maintain effort on Medicaid eligibility consistent with requirements prior to passage of this law. In August, 2010, H.R. 1586 was enacted into law and
extended the enhanced FMAPs until June 30, 2011, but at a reduced rate. The FMAP increase will be 3.2% during the first quarter of 2011 and 1.2% during the second quarter. Due to the indirect nature of the enhanced Medicaid federal funding
contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and H.R. 1586, we are unable to determine the impact of these Medicaid changes on our future results of operations.

Certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas (Hildalgo, Maverick, Potter and Webb) participate in
CMS-approved private Medicaid supplemental payment (“UPL”) programs. These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these
counties. Our hospitals receive both UPL payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals. The UPL payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer
(“IGT”) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals. We received $38 million during 2010, $48 million during 2009 and $30 million during 2008,
of aggregate, net UPL and affiliated hospital indigent care payments. If during 2011 the hospital district makes IGTs consistent with 2010, we believe we would be entitled to aggregate, net UPL and affiliated hospital indigent care payment revenues
of approximately $35 million during 2011.

In July 2009, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (“THHSC”)
issued a final rule and will rebase during state fiscal year (“SFY”) 2010, on a statewide budget neutral basis, all acute care hospital inpatient Standard Dollar Amount (“SDA”) rates. In addition, the THHSC will also rebase all
MS-DRG relative weights concurrent with this SDA rate change. The THHSC will use SFY2008 cost report data for the SDA and relative



weight rebasing and will only make changes on a prospective basis regardless of when the rebased SDA rates and relative weights are implemented. The THHSC recently notified hospitals of their
rebased SFY2011 SDA rates, preliminary statewide MS-DRG relative weights for SFY2011 and the estimated statewide budget neutrality adjustment. In addition, in October, 2010, THHSC finalized a rule whereby: (i) the period November 1, 2010
to August 31, 2011 will be considered a transition period to fully rebased SDA rates, and; (ii) fully rebased SDA rates will then become effective September 1, 2011. We estimate that the November 1, 2010 rate changes will not
have a material impact on our inpatient Medicaid reimbursement. In addition, we estimate the September 1, 2011 SDA rate changes could potentially reduce our inpatient Medicaid reimbursement by up to $5 million annually.

The THHSC has indicated an intention to expand state Medicaid managed care programs in future state fiscal years starting in the
state’s 2012 fiscal year. Although we are unable to determine the impact of the managed care expansion on future Medicaid reimbursement or its impact on Medicaid UPL payments, depending on the actual structure of the actual managed care
expansion, this change could have a material adverse impact on our Medicaid UPL payments.

Managed Care:

A
significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage)
and Medicaid programs. In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow. The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our
facilities vary among the markets in which we operate. Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from
many of our commercial payors including managed care companies.

Commercial Insurance:

Our hospitals also provide
services to individuals covered by private health care insurance. Private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital’s established charges
and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy. Private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor.

Commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms,
including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services. To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers’ reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to
their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.

Other Sources:

Our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage. Such patients
are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals’ indigent and
charity care policy. Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.

State Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments:

Hospitals that have an unusually large number of low-income patients
(i.e., those with a Medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean Medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital
(“DSH”) adjustment. Congress established a national limit on DSH adjustments. Although this legislation and the resulting state broad-based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the Medicaid program, to date the net
impact has not been materially adverse.

Upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of
Texas’ and South Carolina’s low income patients, five of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina received



additional reimbursement from each state’s DSH fund. The Texas and South Carolina programs have been renewed for each state’s 2011 fiscal years (covering the period of October 1,
2010 through September 30, 2011 for each state). In connection with these DSH programs, included in our financial results was an aggregate of $54 million during 2010, $56 million during 2009 and $42 million during 2008. Failure to renew these
DSH programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of our hospitals that currently receive DSH payments to qualify for future DSH funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our
future results of operations. . Assuming that the Texas and South Carolina programs are renewed for each state’s 2012 fiscal years at amounts similar to the 2011 fiscal year amounts, we estimate our aggregate reimbursements pursuant to these
programs to be $47 million during 2011.

Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform:

Given increasing budget
deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals. In addition, the
uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, the War on Terrorism, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, the expansion of a Medicare drug benefit and the
federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future. We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.

In March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872, P.L. 111-152), (the “Reconciliation Act”)
and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), (the “Affordable Care Act”), were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the
federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs. Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below.

Immediate Medicare Reductions:

The Reconciliation Act reduced the market basket update for inpatient and outpatient hospitals and inpatient behavioral health facilities in each of 2010 and 2011 by 0.25%. Further, the Affordable Care
Act implements certain reforms to Medicare Advantage payments, effective in 2011.

Future Medicare Reductions:

Future changes to the Medicare program include:

•

Implements a Medicare shared savings program (effective 2012)

•

Implement a hospital readmissions reduction program (effective 2012)

•

Implement a national pilot program on payment bundling (effective 2013)

•

Implement a value-based purchasing program for hospitals (effective 2012)

•

Reduction to Medicare disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) payments (effective 2014)

Medicaid Revisions:

•

Expanded Medicaid eligibility and related special federal payments (effective 2014)

•

Reduction to Medicaid DSH (effective 2014)

Health Insurance Revisions:

•

Large employer insurance reforms (effective 2014)

•

Individual insurance mandate and related federal subsidies (effective 2014)

•

Federally mandated insurance coverage reforms (2010 and forward)



Although we do not believe the above-mentioned Medicare market basket reductions implemented
in 2010 will have a material impact on our results of operations, we are unable to estimate the future impact of the other legislative changes as outlined above.

In addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel
interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as
affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities. The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives,
providers’ rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments. Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues
remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.

Finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls. Reductions in
reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.

Other Operating Results

Combined net revenues from our surgical
hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers were $17 million during 2010, $24 million during 2009 and $29 million during 2008. In connection with construction management contracts pursuant to the terms of which we are
building/have built newly constructed acute care hospitals for an unrelated third party, we earned revenues of $3 million during 2010, $42 million during 2009 and $64 million during 2008. Combined income from continuing operations before income
taxes earned in connection with the revenues mentioned above was $5 million during 2010, $13 million during 2009 and $11 million during 2008.

Interest Expense

Below is a schedule of our interest expense during
2010, 2009 and 2008 (amounts in thousands):

(a.)

In June, 2008, we issued an additional $150 million of senior notes (the “Notes”) which formed a single series with the original $250 million
of Notes issued in June, 2006 (see

Note 4—Long Term Debt

). Other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the Notes issued in June, 2008 are



identical to, and trade interchangeably with, the Notes which were originally issued in June, 2006. The proceeds from this issuance were used to repay other outstanding borrowings.

(b.)

Pursuant to the terms of these notes, which were assumed by us in connection with the acquisition of PSI, notice of redemption was provided by us as of the acquisition
date and the indenture was satisfied and discharged and these notes were subsequently redeemed on December 15, 2010 utilizing borrowed funds which were held in escrow from November 15, 2010 to the date of redemption.

Interest expense increased $32 million during 2010 to $78 million during 2010 as compared to $46 million during
2009. This increase was due primarily to: (i) the increased borrowings used to finance our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, and an increase in the average effective interest rate, as discussed below; (ii) the interest expense incurred
during 2010 on the $250 million, 7.00% senior notes issued in September, 2010, and; (iii) the interest expense incurred during 2010 on the $590 million, 7.75% notes assumed in connection with the acquisition of PSI in November, 2010 (these
notes were redeemed on December 15, 2010) . During 2010, the average outstanding borrowings under our new $3.45 billion credit agreement (consisting of an $800 million revolving credit facility, a $1.05 billion Term Loan A and a $1.6 billion
Term Loan B) , accounts receivable securitization program and previously outstanding credit agreement was $610 million as compared to $287 million during 2009. The effective interest rate on these facilities, including the amortization of deferred
financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 5.0% during 2010 and 3.9% during 2009. Interest expense decreased $7 million during 2009 to $46 million as compared to $53 million during 2008. The decrease
resulted primarily from a decrease in the combined interest expense on our revolving credit agreement, demand notes, senior notes and accounts receivable securitization program. This decrease was due primarily to an $81 million decrease in the
aggregate average outstanding borrowings on those debt facilities and a 0.4% decrease in the weighted average borrowing rate.

Transaction costs incurred in connection with acquisition of PSI

During 2010, we incurred $53 million of transaction costs in connection with our acquisitions of PSI in November, 2010, consisting of the
following:

Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates

The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income from continuing operations before income
taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in thousands):

The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the

in thousands):

Impacting the effective tax rates during 2010 were the following items: (i) $5 million unfavorable
discrete tax item recorded to adjust the non-deductible portion of certain transaction costs incurred during 2010 in connection with our acquisition of PSI; (ii) a $4 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded to adjust for the
non-deductible, $9 million charge incurred from split-dollar life insurance agreements entered into during 2010 on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife, partially offset by; (iii) a $4 million favorable discrete tax item
recorded during 2010 to adjust the estimated non-deductible portion of the previously disclosed South Texas Health System settlement with the government based upon the final agreement. Impacting the effective tax rates during 2009 was a $4 million
unfavorable discrete tax item related to the estimated non-deductible portion of the South Texas Health System settlement.

Discontinued Operations

In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, we agreed to divest three former PSI
facilities, one of which is located in Delaware (MeadowWood Behavioral Health System) and two of which are located in Nevada (Montevista Hospital and Red Rock Hospital) as well as one of our legacy facilities in Puerto Rico (Hospital San Juan
Capestrano). Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with the FTC, we are required to divest the facilities in Delaware and Nevada within approximately six months and the facility in Puerto Rico within approximately nine months from the date the FTC
finalizes the agreement. As of the date of this filing, our agreement with the FTC is not final and thus, the time period within which we must divest the facilities has not yet commenced. The operating results for the three former PSI
facilities located in Delaware and Nevada are reflected as discontinued operations during 2010 from the
November 15

th

date of acquisition through
December 31

st

. Since the aggregate income from
discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is not material to our 2010 consolidated financial statements, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses. The assets and liabilities for MeadowWood Behavioral
Health System, Montevista Hospital, Red Rock Hospital and Hospital San Juan Capestrano are reflected as “held for sale” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010.

During 2008, we sold a 125-bed acute care hospital located in Pennsylvania and commenced divestiture considerations for the real property
of our four acute care facilities located in Louisiana that were severely damaged and closed during 2005 as a result of damage sustained from Hurricane Katrina. The operating results and gain on divestiture for the facility located in Pennsylvania
are reflected as “Income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2008.



The following table shows the results of operations of these facilities, on a combined
basis, for all facilities reflected as discontinued operations (amounts in thousands):

Effects of Inflation and Seasonality

Seasonality

—Our acute care services business is typically seasonal, with higher patient volumes and net patient service
revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year. This seasonality occurs because, generally, more people become ill during the winter months, which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those
months.

Inflation

—Inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years.
However, since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supply and other costs, we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to
contain future expense increases. Our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases,
limit our ability to increase prices. We believe, however, that through adherence to cost containment policies, labor management and reasonable price increases, the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable.

Liquidity

Year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009:

Net cash provided by operating activities

Net cash provided by
operating activities was $501 million during 2010 as compared to $541 million during 2009. The net decrease of $40 million, or 7%, was primarily attributable to the following:

•

an unfavorable net change of $7 million due to an decrease in net income, plus or minus the adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by
operating activities (depreciation and amortization, gains on sales of businesses and assets and stock-based compensation expense);

•

a favorable change of $24 million in accounts receivable;

•

an unfavorable change of $30 million in construction management and other receivable which includes $10 million of cash proceeds received during the
first quarter of 2009 from the estate liquidation of a commercial insurer (related receivable was recorded during fourth quarter of 2008);

•

an unfavorable change of $15 million in accrued and deferred income taxes;

•

an unfavorable change of $25 million in accrued insurance expense, net of commercial premium paid, resulting primarily from the reductions recorded
during 2010 and 2009 to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks);

•

a favorable change of $8 million in accrued interest, and;

•

$5 million of other combined net favorable changes.



Days sales outstanding (“DSO”):

Our DSO are calculated by
dividing our annual net revenue by the number of days in the year. The result is divided into the accounts receivable balance at the end of the year to obtain the DSO. Without adjustment, our DSO were 43 days in 2010, 42 days in 2009 and 46 days in
2008. No adjustments were required to our 2010 or 2009 DSO. After adjusting our 2008 year-end accounts receivable balance for the PHICO liquidation and construction management receivables as of December 31, 2008, our adjusted DSO were 44 days
in 2008.

Capital Resources

Credit Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities

On
November 15, 2010, we terminated our credit agreement dated March 4, 2005 (the “Prior Credit Agreement”). The Prior Credit Agreement provided for an unsecured revolving line of credit of up to $800 million including a $100
sublimit for letters of credit. The interest rate on borrowings was determined, at our option, as either (i) the LIBOR plus a spread of 0.33% to 0.575% or (ii) at the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5%. A facility
fee ranging from 0.07% to .175% based on our credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. was required on the total commitment.



Also, on November 15, 2010, we entered into a new credit agreement (the “Credit
Agreement”) with various financial institutions. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured credit facility in an aggregate amount of $3.45 billion, comprised of a new $800 million revolving credit facility, a $1.05 billion Term Loan A
facility and a $1.6 billion Term Loan B facility. The revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A mature on November 15, 2015 and the Term Loan B matures on November 16, 2016. The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million
sub-limit for letters of credit. The senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and our material subsidiaries (the “Collateral”) and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.

Borrowings made pursuant to the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, (1) at the
greatest of : (a) the lender’s prime rate; (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5%, and; (c) one month LIBOR plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin which ranges from 1.50% to 3.00%, initially
2.25%, 2.25% and 3.00% for the revolving credit facility, the Term Loan A facility and the Term Loan B facility, respectively, or: (2) one, two, three, or six month LIBOR (at our election), plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.5% to 4.0%
initially 3.25%, 3.25% and 4.00% for the revolving credit facility, the Term Loan A facility and the Term Loan B facility, respectively. At no time shall the LIBOR rate used to determine the rate on a tranche B Term Loan be deemed to be less than
1.50%. A commitment fee ranging from .25% to .50% is required on the unused commitment. At December 31, 2010 the applicable commitment fee was .50%. Commencing with the quarter ending June 30, 2011 the applicable margins for the Term Loan
A facility and the revolving credit facility are subject to increase or decrease based upon our consolidated leverage ratio or upon our credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Moody’s Investor Services Inc. at
such time. There are no compensating balance requirements.

In October, 2010, we amended our accounts receivable
securitization program (“Securitization”) with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks. We increased the size of the Securitization to $240 million (the “Commitments”), from $200 million, and extended the maturity date to
October 25, 2013. Substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals (“Receivables”) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings. The interest rate on the borrowings is based on the
commercial paper rate plus a spread of .475% and there is a facility fee of .375% required on 102% on the Commitments. We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings. We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the
terms of the Securitization; the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us. The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the
debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities. The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans
obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks. The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the
loans. We had $204 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program.

As of December 31, 2010, we had $3 million of outstanding borrowings under a short-term, on-demand credit facility. Outstanding
borrowings pursuant to this facility are classified as long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet since they can be refinanced through available borrowings under the terms of our Credit Agreement.

As of December 31, 2010, we had an aggregate of $577 million of available borrowing capacity pursuant to the terms of our Credit
Agreement and Securitization, net of $71 million of outstanding letters of credit and $3 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to the short-term, on-demand note.

On November 15, 2010, in connection with our acquisition of PSI, we assumed $1.08 billion of PSI’s outstanding debt. As of December 15, 2010, $1.05 billion of PSI’s outstanding
borrowings, in addition to $29 million of call premiums and original issue discounts related to PSI’s senior subordinated notes, was repaid utilizing funds borrowed under our Credit Agreement. In connection with PSI’s 7.75% senior
subordinated notes



due in 2015 (“PSI Notes”), we provided notice of redemption of all the PSI Notes and irrevocably deposited $632 million (the redemption price plus interest through December 15,
2010) with the trustee on November 15, 2010 thereby satisfying and discharging our obligations under the PSI Notes.

On
September 29, 2010, we issued $250 million of 7.00% senior unsecured notes (the “Unsecured Notes”) which are scheduled to mature on October 1, 2018. The funds generated from this debt issuance were held in escrow until the
November 15, 2010 completion date of the PSI acquisition. Interest on the Unsecured Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on April 1st and October 1st of each year. The Unsecured Notes can be redeemed in whole at anytime subject to
a make-whole call at treasury rate plus 50 basis points prior to October 1, 2014. They are also redeemable in whole or in part at a price of: (i) 103.5% on or after October 1, 2014; (ii) 101.75% on or after October 1, 2015, and; (iii) 100% on or
after October 1, 2016.

On June 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior notes which have a 7.125% coupon rate and
mature on June 30, 2016 (the “7.125% Notes”). Interest on the 7.125% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 30th and December 30th of each year. In June, 2008, we issued an additional $150 million of 7.125% Notes
which formed a single series with the original 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2006. Other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to and trade interchangeably with,
the 7.125% Notes which were originally issued in June, 2006.

During 2001, we issued $200 million of senior notes which have a
6.75% coupon rate and which mature on November 15, 2011 (the “6.75% Notes”). The interest on the 6.75% Notes is paid semiannually in arrears on May 15th and November 15th of each year. The 6.75% Notes can be redeemed in
whole at any time and in part from time to time. Since we expect to have the borrowing capacity, and intend to refinance the 6.75% Notes upon their maturity in November, 2011 utilizing borrowings under our Credit Agreement, they are classified as
long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010.

In connection with the entering into of the
Credit Agreement on November 15, 2010, and in accordance with the Indenture dated January 20, 2000 governing the rights of our existing notes, we entered into a supplemental indenture pursuant to which our 7.125% Notes (due in 2015) and
our 6.75% Notes (due in 2011) will be equally and ratably secured with the lenders under the Credit Agreement with respect to the collateral for so long as the lenders under the Credit Agreement are so secured.

The average amounts outstanding during 2010, 2009, and 2008 are under the Credit Agreement, Prior Credit Agreement, demand notes and
accounts receivable securitization program were $610 million, $287 million and $431 million, respectively, with corresponding interest rates of 3.4%, 1.7%, and 3.9% including commitment and facility fees. The maximum amounts outstanding at any
month-end were $3.11 billion in 2010, $356 million in 2009, and $566 million in 2008. The effective interest rate on our Credit Agreement, accounts receivable securitization program and demand notes, which includes the respective interest expense,
commitment and facility fees, designated interest rate swaps expense and amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts, was 5.0% in 2010, 3.9% in 2009, and 4.5% in 2008.

Our Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw. The Credit Agreement includes
covenants that include (1) a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens and indebtedness, transactions with affiliates and dividends; and (2) requires compliance financial covenants including maximum leverage and
minimum interest coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all required covenants as of December 31, 2010.

The fair
value of our long-term debt at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $3.96 billion and $1.02 billion, respectively.

Our total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 66% at December 31, 2010 and 35% at December 31, 2009.



We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay dividends and
potentially repurchase shares of our common stock utilizing internally generated and additional funds. Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) the issuance of equity; (ii) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility or
through refinancing the existing revolving credit agreement, and/or; (iii) the issuance of other long-term debt. In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2010 we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety
bonds. Our outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of December 31, 2010 totaled $76 million consisting of: (i) $63 million related to our self-insurance programs; (ii) $3 million related primarily to pending appeals of legal
judgments (including judgments related to professional and general liability claims), and; (iii) $10 million of other debt guarantees related to public utilities and entities in which we own a minority interest.

Obligations under operating leases for real property, real property master leases and equipment amount to $196 million as of
December 31, 2010. The real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near hospital property for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income. We sublease space in these buildings and any amounts received from these subleases
are offset against the expense. In addition, we lease four hospital facilities from the Trust with terms expiring in 2011 and 2014. These leases contain up to four 5-year renewal options. We also lease the real property of certain facilities
acquired by us in connection with the acquisition of PSI in November, 2010.

The following represents the scheduled maturities
of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010:

(a)

Reflects borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2010 as discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(b)

Assumes that all debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010, including borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, Term Loan A, Term Loan B, demand note and
accounts receivable securitization program, remain outstanding until the final maturity of the debt agreements at the same interest rates which were in effect as of December 31, 2010. We have the right to repay borrowings upon short notice and
without penalty, pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit agreement, demand note, Term Loan A facility and accounts receivable securitization program. In connection with the Term Loan B facility, there is a 1% premium required on optional
repayments prior to November 15, 2011.

(c)

Consists of: (i) $82 million related to long-term contracts with third-parties consisting primarily of certain revenue cycle data processing
services for our acute care facilities; (ii) $81 million related to the expected costs to be paid to a third-party vendor in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic



health records application (“EHR”) for each of our acute care facilities (excludes expected internal costs to be incurred, please see

Item 7-Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Medicare

for additional disclosure), and; (iii) a $15 million liability for physician commitments expected to be paid in the future.

(d)

Reflects our future minimum operating lease payment obligations related to our operating lease agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2010 as discussed in Note
7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of the lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease and our future lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options.

(e)

Consists of $220 million of estimated future payments related to our non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan (estimated through 2087), as disclosed in

Note 8
to the Consolidated Financial Statements

, $14 million of estimated future payments related to another retirement plan liability and $21 million of deferred severance payments due related to our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010. Included in
our other non-current liabilities as of December 31, 2010 was a $20 million liability recorded in connection with the non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan and a $10 million liability recorded in connection with the other retirement
plan. The $21 million of deferred severance payments related to our acquisition of PSI are included in accrued compensation and related benefits as of December 31, 2010.

As of December 31, 2010, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $289 million, of which $60 million
is included in other current liabilities and $229 million is included in other non-current liabilities. We exclude the $289 million for professional and general liability claims from the contractual obligations table because there are no significant
contractual obligations associated with these liabilities and because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments. Please see Self-Insured Risks

above for additional disclosure related
to our professional and general liability claims and reserves.

In connection with five acute care facilities located in Las
Vegas, Nevada, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain “put rights”, that are currently exercisable, that if
exercised, require us to purchase the minority member’s interests at fair market value. The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds;
(ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member’s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds. In connection with a behavioral health care
facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and acquired by us as part of the PSI acquisition, the minority ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owner
has a “put option” to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time. If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member’s interest at fair market value. As of December 31, 2010, we believe the fair
market value of the minority ownership interests in these facilities approximates the $212 million aggregate book value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests. We exclude the approximate amount that we may be required to pay to repurchase these
minority ownership interests from the contractual obligations table because of the uncertainty as to: (i) whether or not the put rights will actually be exercised; (ii) the dollar amounts that would be paid if the put rights were
exercised, and; (iii) the timing of such payments.

Additionally, the table above does not include $8 million of the
total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2010. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for which the amounts
may be utilized.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in domestic interest rates, a portion of our debt is fixed rate accomplished by
either borrowing on a long-term basis at fixed rates or by, from time to time, entering into interest rate swap and interest rate cap transactions. Interest rate swap agreements require us to pay fixed and receive floating interest rates or to pay
floating and receive fixed interest rates over the life of the agreements. Interest rate caps provide for us to receive



a payment for each quarter the 3-month LIBOR exceeds a given strike price. We may also, from time to time, enter into treasury locks (“T-Locks”) to protect from a rise in the yield of
the underlying treasury security for a forecasted bond issuance.

Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted the authoritative
guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities which requires additional disclosure about a company’s derivative activities, but does not require any new accounting related to derivative activities. We
have applied the requirements of the guidance on a prospective basis. Accordingly, disclosures related to interim periods prior to the date of adoption have not been presented.

During the fourth quarter of 2010, we entered into three interest rate caps on a total notional amount of $1.00 billion whereby we paid a
premium of $240,000 in exchange for the counterparties agreeing to pay the difference between 2.25% and three-month LIBOR if the 3 month LIBOR rate rises above 2.25% during the term of the caps. If the three month LIBOR does not reach 2.25% during
the term of the caps, no payment is made to us. All of the caps expire on December 15, 2011. We also entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter of 2010 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of
$600 million and receive 3-month LIBOR. Each of the four swaps become effective on December 15, 2011 and will mature on May 15, 2015. The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 2.38%.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, we entered into two interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional principal
amount of $150 million and receive 3-month LIBOR. Each of the two interest rate swaps had an original notional principal amount of $75 million. The interest rate swaps mature on October 17, 2011 and October 5, 2012 and have fixed rates
payable of 4.865% and 4.7625%, respectively. The notional amount of the interest rate swap maturing on October 17, 2011 reduced to $50 million on October 18, 2010.

During the second quarter of 2006, in connection with the issuance of the $250 million of senior notes (“Notes”) which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016, we entered into
T-Locks, with an aggregate notional amount of $250 million, to lock in the 10-year treasury rate underlying the bond issuance. These T-Locks, which were designated as cash flow hedges, were unwound during the second quarter of 2006 resulting in a $3
million cash payment to us which has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (net of income taxes) and is being amortized over the life of the 10-year Notes.

The table below presents information about our long-term financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2010. For debt obligations, the table presents
principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

Maturity Date, Fiscal Year
Ending December 31

(Dollars in thousands)



As calculated based upon our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010
that is subject to interest rate fluctuations, each 1% change in interest rates would impact our pre-tax income by approximately $30 million.

ITEM 9A.

Controls and Procedures.

As of December 31, 2010, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), we
performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by management on a timely basis in order to comply with our disclosure obligations under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, and the SEC rules thereunder.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the
fourth quarter of 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

In November, 2010, we completed the acquisition of PSI. We are in the process of transferring all accounting for the new acquisition to our headquarters and into our existing internal control procedures.
The integration may lead to changes in these controls in future periods but we do not expect these changes to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over our financial reporting. In order
to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria on

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework,

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We have excluded the
facilities acquired from PSI from the assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 because it was acquired by us in a purchase business combination in



November, 2010. These facilities represented 40% and 4% of our consolidated total assets and total net revenues, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Based on its assessment, management has concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2010, based on criteria in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework,

issued by the COSO. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears herein.

UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES, INC.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Universal Health Services, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Universal Health Services, Inc. at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, financial statement schedule, and for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included under item 9A as

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in under item 9A

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

, management has excluded Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries from its assessment of internal control



over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2010. We have also excluded Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. from
our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries are wholly owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues represent 40% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial
statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1) BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Services provided by our hospitals, all of which are operated by subsidiaries of ours include general and specialty surgery, internal
medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services. We, through our subsidiaries, provide capital resources as well as a variety of
management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.

The more significant accounting policies follow:

A) Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships controlled by us or our subsidiaries as the
managing general partner. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

B) Revenue
Recognition:

We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided. Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 38% of our net patient revenues during each of 2010, 2009 and 2008. Revenues
from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 46% of our net patient revenues during each of 2010, 2009 and 2008.

We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for
services rendered. We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates. Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted
charges and per diem payments. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in
applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available. However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different
from the amounts we estimate and record.

We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial
information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations. The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and
subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term. Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g.
Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the
final settlements. Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes. As such, we can not
provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts
did not materially impact our results in 2010, 2009 or 2008.

We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or
economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, amounting to $807 million during 2010, $671 million during 2009 and $609 million during 2008.



C) Provision for Doubtful Accounts:

Collection of receivables from
third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient’s responsibility, primarily
co-payments and deductibles. We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in
conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted. At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts
are pursued until all payments and adjustments are posted to the patient account. For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient is sent a series of statements and
collection letters. Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of assistance including our charity care policy. If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an
outside collection agency for additional collection effort. Our accounts receivable are recorded net of established charity care reserves of $99 million as of December 31, 2010 and $61 million as of December 31, 2009.

Uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of at least 20% of total charges. During
the collection process the hospital establishes a partial reserve in the allowance for doubtful accounts for self-pay balances outstanding for greater than 60 days from the date of discharge. All self-pay accounts at the hospital level are fully
reserved if they have been outstanding for greater than 90 days from the date of discharge. Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
Potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay.

On a consolidated
basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, accounts receivable
are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $249 million and $169 million, respectively.

D) Concentration
of Revenues:

Our five majority owned acute care hospitals in the Las Vegas, Nevada market contributed, on a combined basis, 21% in 2010 and 22% in each of 2009 and 2008, of our consolidated net revenues. On a combined basis, our facilities
in the McAllen/Edinburg, Texas market (consisting of three acute care facilities, a children’s hospital and a behavioral health facility) contributed 6% in 2010 and 7% in each of 2009 and 2008 of our consolidated net revenues.

E) Cash and Cash Equivalents:

We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.

F) Property and Equipment:

Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Expenditures for renewals and improvements are charged to the property accounts. Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred. We remove the cost and the related
accumulated depreciation from the accounts for assets sold or retired and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations.

We capitalize interest expense on major construction projects while in progress. We capitalized interest on major construction projects amounting to $7.6 million during 2010, $11.6 million during 2009 and
$7.9 million during 2008.

Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of buildings
and improvements (twenty to forty years) and equipment (three to fifteen years). Depreciation expense (excluding discontinued operations) was $202.8 million during 2010, $184.6 million during 2009 and $176.1 million during 2008.



G) Long-Lived Assets:

We review our long-lived assets, including
amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of
our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow. If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is
recognized. Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.

H) Goodwill:

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise. Our judgments regarding the existence of
impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit. We have designated September 1

st

as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2010 which
indicated no impairment of goodwill. There were also no goodwill impairments during 2009 or 2008. Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment
in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill.

Changes in the carrying amount of
goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2010 were as follows (in thousands):

(a)

Consists of adjustments to prior year purchase price allocations.

(b)

The reduction to the Behavioral Health Services’ goodwill consists primarily of a reclassification to “assets of facilities held for sale” and represents
the goodwill attributable to a legacy facility which we agreed to divest pursuant to our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission.

I) Other Assets:

Other assets consist primarily of amounts related to: (i) intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.
(“PSI”) in November, 2010 consisting of Medicare licenses, certificates of need and contracts to manage the operations of behavioral health services owned by third-parties; (ii) prepaid fees for various software and other applications
used by our hospitals; (iii) costs incurred in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application for each of our acute care facilities; (iv) deposits; (v) investments in various businesses,
including Universal Health Realty Income Trust; (vi) the invested assets related to a deferred compensation plan that is held by an independent trustee in a rabbi-trust and that has a related payable included in other noncurrent liabilities;
(vii) the estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments, as discussed below, and; (viii) other miscellaneous assets. As of December 31, 2010 other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization,
were approximately $100 million. Other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were not material to our financial statements as of December 31, 2009.

J) Physician Guarantees and Commitments:

As of December 31, 2010, our accrued liabilities-other, and our other assets include $8 million of estimated future payments related to
physician-related contractual



commitments. Pursuant to contractual guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2010 that are applicable to future years, we have $15 million of potential future financial obligations of
which $13 million are potential obligations during 2011 and $2 million are potential obligations during 2012 and later.

K) Self-Insured Risks:

We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and
workers’ compensation claims. Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of
losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies. All relevant
information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from
our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate. Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as
a reduction of expense. See Note 8 for discussion of revisions to prior year general and professional liability reserves and self-insurance liability assumed in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010. Based on the results of
workers’ compensation reserves analyses, we recorded reductions of prior year reserves of $4 million during 2010, $7 million during 2009 and $4 million during 2008.

L) Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.

We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws. We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities. Our tax returns
have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) through the year ended December 31, 2006. We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.

See Note 6 for additional disclosure regarding income taxes.

M) Other Noncurrent Liabilities:

Other noncurrent liabilities include the long-term portion of our professional and general liability, workers’ compensation reserves, pension and
deferred compensation liabilities, liability incurred in connection with split-dollar life insurance agreements on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife and interest rate swap liabilities.

N) Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interest:

Outside owners hold noncontrolling, minority
ownership interests of: (i) approximately 28% in our five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada; (ii) 20% in an acute care facility located in Washington, D.C.; (iii) approximately 11% in an acute care facility located in
Laredo, Texas, and; (iv) 20% in a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the majority ownership interest of which was acquired by us as result of our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010. The redeemable
noncontrolling interests balances of $212 million and $197 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and the noncontrolling interests balances of $45 million and $41 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively,
consist primarily of the third-party ownership interests in these hospitals.

Generally accepted accounting principles require
that noncontrolling interests be classified as equity and we have previously presented all noncontrolling interests in total equity. However, since certain of our noncontrolling interests have redemption rights outside of our control, those
noncontrolling interests are classified outside of permanent equity and reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests. As previously disclosed in our Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2010 and September 30,
2010, noncontrolling interests with an estimated redemption amount of $197 million as of December 31, 2009 and $186 million as of December 31, 2008, have been reclassified from total equity to redeemable noncontrolling interests



outside of permanent equity. These revisions did not affect stockholders’ equity attributable to UHS nor did they affect any previously reported percentages based upon equity (such as
percentage of debt to total capitalization and return on average equity), since we have based those calculations on only stockholders’ equity attributable to UHS (as opposed to total equity). We do not believe that these revisions, which are
reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Common Stockholders’ Equity for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, as included herein, are material to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the prior years.

The applicable sections of our December 31, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity for the
Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, as reported and as revised, are as follows (amounts in thousands):

In connection with the five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the minority ownership
interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain “put rights”, that are currently exercisable, that if exercised, require us to purchase the minority
member’s interests at fair market value. The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing
member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member’s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds. In connection with the behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the minority
ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010, the outside owner has a “put option” to put its entire ownership interest to us at any
time. If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member’s interest at fair market value. As of December 31, 2010, we believe the fair market value of the minority ownership interests in these facilities approximates
the book value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests.

O) Comprehensive Income:

Comprehensive income or
loss, is comprised of net income, changes in unrealized gains or losses on derivative financial instruments and a pension liability.

P) Accounting for Derivative Financial Investments and Hedging Activities:

We manage our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management
believes is appropriate. To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon
notional amounts.

We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s
(“FASB”) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet. For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we
formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other
types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Cash flow hedges



are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income (“AOCI”) within shareholders’ equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.

We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions. Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting
changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset,
liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the
hedged item in the income statement.

For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge’s
inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged
items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.

Q) Stock-Based Compensation:

At
December 31, 2010, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans. Pursuant to the FASB’s guidance, we expense the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation pursuant to the straight-line method
over the stated vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The expense associated with
share-based compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities. The applicable FASB
guidance requires that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized be classified as financing cash flows. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, there were no net excess tax benefits generated.

R) Earnings per Share:

Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the year. Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year adjusted to give effect to common stock equivalents.



The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, for
the periods indicated:

The “Net effect of dilutive stock options and grants based on the treasury stock method”, for all
years presented above, excludes certain outstanding stock options applicable to each year since the effect would have been anti-dilutive. The excluded weighted-average stock options totaled 1,000 during 2010, 3.6 million during 2009 and 1.9 million
during 2008.

S) Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The fair values of our registered debt and investments
are based on quoted market prices. The fair values of other long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are estimated by discounting cash flows using period-end interest rates and market conditions for instruments with similar maturities
and credit quality. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings approximates their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Accordingly, these
items have been excluded from the fair value disclosures included elsewhere in these notes to consolidated financial statements.

T) Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

U) Mergers and Acquisitions

:

The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations
requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values



with limited exceptions. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as
goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The fair value of intangible assets, including Medicare Licenses, Certificates of Need, and certain contracts, is based on significant judgments made
by our management, and accordingly, for significant items we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists.

V) Accounting Standards:

Transfers of Financial Assets:

In
June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets. This amendment requires greater transparency and additional disclosures for transfers of financial assets and the entity’s
continuing involvement with them and changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets. In addition, this amendment eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity (“QSPE”). This amendment became effective for us on
January 1, 2010. This amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities:

In June 2009, the FASB also issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities
(“VIE”s). The elimination of the concept of a QSPE, as discussed above, removes the exception from applying the consolidation guidance within this amendment. This amendment requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis when
determining whether or not it must consolidate a VIE. The amendment also requires an enterprise to continuously reassess whether it must consolidate a VIE. Additionally, the amendment requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise’s
involvement with VIEs and any significant change in risk exposure due to that involvement, as well as how its involvement with VIEs impacts the enterprise’s financial statements. Finally, an enterprise will be required to disclose significant
judgments and assumptions used to determine whether or not to consolidate a VIE. This amendment became effective for us on January 1, 2010. This amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

Presentation of Insurance Claims and Related Insurance Recoveries:

In August 2010, the FASB issued
Accounting Standard Updates (“ASU”) 2010-24, “Health Care Entities (Topic 954): Presentation of Insurance Claims and Related Insurance Recoveries,” which clarifies that a health care entity should not net insurance
recoveries against a related claim liability. The guidance provided in this ASU is effective for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have
any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Measuring Charity Care for Disclosures:

In
August 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-23, “Health Care Entities (Topic 954): Measuring Charity Care for Disclosure,” which prescribes a specific measurement basis of charity care for disclosure. The guidance provided in this ASU is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures:

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2010-06,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements

(“ASU 2010-06). ASU 2010-06 affects all entities that are required to make disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value
measurements under FASB ASC Topic 820, originally issued as FASB Statement No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

. This ASU requires certain new disclosures and clarifies two existing disclosure requirements. The new disclosures and
clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in
Level 3 fair value measurements.



Those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU No. 2010-06 is not expected to have a
significant impact on our disclosures.

2) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

Year ended December 31, 2010:

2010 Acquisitions of Assets
and Businesses:

During 2010, we spent $1.96 billion and assumed $1.08 billion of debt on the acquisition of businesses and
real property, including the following:

•

the acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. on November 15, 2010 for a total purchase price of $3.04 billion consisting of $1.96 billion in
cash plus the assumption of approximately $1.08 billion of PSI’s debt, the majority of which has since been refinanced. PSI was formerly the largest operator of freestanding inpatient behavioral health care facilities operating a total of 105
inpatient and outpatient facilities in 32 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and;

•

the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of an outpatient surgery center located in Florida in which we previously held a 20% minority
ownership interest. The purchase price consideration in connection with this transaction, which occurred during the first quarter, consisted of acquisition of the net assets less the assumption of the outstanding liabilities and third-party debt.

The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their
preliminary estimated fair values as follows:

Goodwill of the facilities acquired is computed, pursuant to the residual method, by deducting the fair
value of the acquired assets and liabilities from the total purchase price. The factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill, which may also influence the purchase price, include the following for each of the acquired facilities:
(i) the historical cash flows and income levels; (ii) the reputations in their respective markets; (iii) the nature of the respective operations, and; (iv) the future cash flows and income growth projections.

In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) in connection with our
acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, we agreed to divest three former PSI facilities, one of which is located in Delaware (MeadowWood Behavioral Health System) and two of which are located in Nevada (Montevista Hospital and Red Rock Hospital) as
well as one of our legacy facilities in Puerto Rico (Hospital San Juan Capestrano). Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with the FTC, we are required to divest the facilities in Delaware and Nevada within approximately six months and the facility
in Puerto Rico within approximately nine months from the date the FTC finalizes the agreement. As of the date of this filing, our agreement with the FTC



is not final and thus, the time period within which we must divest the facilities has not yet commenced. The operating results for the three former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada
are reflected as discontinued operations during 2010 from the November 15

th

date of acquisition through December 31

st

. Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is not material to our 2010 consolidated financial statements, it is included as a reduction to
other operating expenses. The assets and liabilities for MeadowWood Behavioral Health System, Montevista Hospital, Red Rock Hospital and Hospital San Juan Capestrano are reflected as “held for sale” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December 31, 2010. The assets of facilities held for sale includes $11 million of accounts receivable, $18 million of property and equipment, $89 million of goodwill and $1 million of other assets. The liabilities of facilities held for sale
includes $2 million of accounts payable and $2 million of accrued compensation and related benefits.

During 2008, we sold a
125-bed acute care hospital located in Pennsylvania and commenced divestiture considerations for the real property of our four acute care facilities located in Louisiana that were severely damaged and closed during 2005 as a result of damage
sustained from Hurricane Katrina. The operating results and gain on divestiture for the facility located in Pennsylvania are reflected as “Income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense” in the Consolidated
Statements of Income for 2008.

The following table shows the results of operations of these facilities, on a combined basis,
for all facilities reflected as discontinued operations (amounts in thousands):

Assuming the acquisition of PSI occurred on January 1, 2009, our 2009 pro forma net revenues would have
been approximately $7.01 billion and our pro forma net income attributable to UHS and pro form net income attributable to UHS per diluted share would have been $211 million and $2.14 per diluted share, respectively. The 2009 pro forma net income
attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share include the after-tax impact of the transaction costs incurred by us in connection with the acquisition of PSI amounting to $79 million or $.81 per diluted share.

Our 2010 pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $7.30 billion and our pro forma net income attributable to UHS and pro
forma net income attributable to UHS per diluted share would have been $342 million and $3.47 per diluted share, respectively.

During the period of November 16, 2010 through December 31, 2010, the facilities acquired from PSI generated $227 million of
net revenues which are included in our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. The aggregate effect of the earnings generated by these facilities since the date of acquisition, less the cost on the borrowings utilized to
finance the acquisition, was not material to our 2010 net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share.



2010 Divestitures of Assets and Businesses:

During 2010, we received $21 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:

•

the sale of our minority ownership interest in a healthcare technology company;

•

the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center located in Texas, and;

•

the sale of the real property of Methodist Hospital located in Louisiana that was severely damaged and closed in 2005 as a result of Hurricane Katrina.

The pre-tax gain, net of losses, resulting from the above-mentioned transactions did not have a material
impact on our 2010 financial statements.

Year ended December 31, 2009:

2009 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses:

During 2009, we spent $12 million on the acquisition of businesses and real property, including the following:

•

the acquisition of a 72-bed behavioral health care facility located in Louisville, Colorado, and;

•

the acquisition of the real property assets of a medical office building located on the campus of one of our acute care hospitals located in Texas.

The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their
estimated fair values as follows:

Amount

(000s)

Working capital, net

$

1,000

Property, plant & equipment

11,000

Cash paid in 2009 for acquisitions

$

12,000

Assuming the acquisition of the behavioral health facility located in Colorado occurred on January 1,
2009, the pro forma effect on our 2009 net revenues, income from continuing operations, income from continuing operations per basic and diluted share, net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per basic and diluted share was
immaterial. Assuming the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2008, the pro forma effect on our 2008 net revenues, income from continuing operations, income from continuing operations per basic and diluted share, net income attributable to UHS
and net income attributable to UHS per basic and diluted share was immaterial.

2009 Divestitures of Assets and Businesses:

During 2009, we received $10 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:

•

the sale of the real property assets of a medical office building on the campus of a previously divested acute care facility located in Pennsylvania,
and;

•

the sale of our ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center



Year ended December 31, 2008:

2008 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses:

During 2008, we spent $23 million on the acquisition of businesses and real property, including the following:

•

the acquisition of a 76-bed behavioral health facility located in Lawrenceville, Georgia, and;

•

the acquisition of previously leased real property assets of a behavioral health facility located in Nevada.

The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as
follows:

Assuming the acquisition of the behavioral health facility located in Georgia occurred on January 1,
2008, the pro forma effect on our 2008 net revenues, income from continuing operations, income from continuing operations per basic and diluted share, net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per basic and diluted share was
immaterial.

Also during 2008, we spent a combined $2 million to purchase/repurchase minority ownership interests in two
outpatient surgery centers. We also received $2 million of net settlement proceeds related to a prior year acquisition.

2008 Divestiture of Assets and Businesses:

During 2008, we received $82 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:

•

the sale of the assets and operations of Central Montgomery Medical Center, a 125-bed acute care facility located in Lansdale, Pennsylvania;

•

the sale of our ownership interest in a third-party provider of supply chain services, and;

•

the sale of our ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center and certain other real property assets.

In addition to the $13 million pre-tax gain recording during 2008 on the sale Central Montgomery Medical Center, which is included in
income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense, our 2008 income from continuing operations includes a combined pre-tax gain of $8 million from the sale of our ownership interest in a third-party provider of supply chain
services and the sale our ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center and certain other real property assets.

3) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair Value Hedges:

During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we had no fair
value hedges outstanding.



Cash Flow Hedges:

Our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in domestic
interest rates, a portion of our debt is fixed rate accomplished by either borrowing on a long-term basis at fixed rates or by, from time to time, entering into interest rate swap and interest rate cap transactions. Interest rate swap agreements
require us to pay fixed and receive floating interest rates or to pay floating and receive fixed interest rates over the life of the agreements. Interest rate caps provide for us to receive a payment for each quarter the 3-month LIBOR exceeds a
given strike price. We may also, from time to time, enter into treasury locks (“T-Locks”) to protect from a rise in the yield of the underlying treasury security for a forecasted bond issuance.

Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and
hedging activities which requires additional disclosure about a company’s derivative activities, but does not require any new accounting related to derivative activities. We have applied the requirements of the guidance on a prospective basis.
Accordingly, disclosures related to interim periods prior to the date of adoption have not been presented.

During the fourth
quarter of 2010, we entered into three interest rate caps on a total notional amount of $1 billion whereby we paid a premium of $240,000 in exchange for the counterparties agreeing to pay the difference between 2.25% and three-month LIBOR if the 3
month LIBOR rate rises above 2.25% during the term of the caps. If the three month LIBOR does not reach 2.25% during the term of the caps, no payment is made to us. All of the caps expire on December 15, 2011. We also entered into four forward
starting interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter of 2010 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $600 million and receive 3-month LIBOR. Each of the four swaps become effective on December 15, 2011 and will mature on
May 15, 2015. The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 2.38%.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, we entered into
two interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional principal amount of $150 million and receive 3-month LIBOR. Each of the two interest rate swaps has a notional principal amount of $75 million. The fixed rate payable on the
first interest rate swap is 4.7625% and matures on October 5, 2012. The fixed rate payable on the second interest rate swap is 4.865% and the maturity date is October, 17, 2011. The notional amount of the second interest rate swap reduced to
$50 million on October 18, 2010. We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on quotes from banks. We consider those inputs to be “level 3” in the
fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities. The fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $10 million at December 31, 2010, of
which $2 million is included in other current liabilities and $8 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet. The fair value of our interest rate swaps was $12 million as of December 31, 2009 which is
included in other noncurrent liabilities.



4) LONG-TERM DEBT

A summary of long-term debt follows:

On November 15, 2010, we terminated our credit agreement dated March 4, 2005 (the “Prior
Credit Agreement”). The Prior Credit Agreement provided for an unsecured revolving line of credit of up to $800 million including a $100 sublimit for letters of credit. The interest rate on borrowings was determined, at our option, as either
(i) the LIBOR plus a spread of 0.33% to 0.575% or (ii) at the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5%. A facility fee ranging from 0.07% to .175% based on our credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s Rating
Services and Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. was required on the total commitment.

Also, on November 15, 2010, we
entered into a new credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with various financial institutions. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured credit facility in an aggregate amount of $3.45 billion, comprised of a new $800 million
revolving credit facility, a $1.05 billion Term Loan A facility and a $1.6 billion Term Loan B facility. The revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A mature on November 15, 2015 and the Term Loan B matures on November 16, 2016. The
revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and our material subsidiaries (the “Collateral”) and
guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.

Borrowings made pursuant to the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to, at our election, (1) at the greatest of: (a) the lender’s prime rate; (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5%, and; (c) one month LIBOR plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin
which ranges from 1.50% to 3.00%, initially 2.25%, 2.25% and 3.00% for the revolving credit facility, the Term Loan A facility and the Term Loan B facility, respectively, or: (2) one, two, three, or six month LIBOR (at our election), plus an
applicable margin ranging from 2.5% to 4.0% initially 3.25%, 3.25% and 4.00% for the revolving credit facility, the Term Loan A facility and the Term Loan B facility, respectively. At no time shall the LIBOR rate used to determine



the rate on a tranche B Term Loan be deemed to be less than 1.50%. A commitment fee ranging from .25% to .50% is required on the unused commitment. At December 31, 2010 the applicable
commitment fee was .50%. Commencing with the quarter ending June 30, 2011 the applicable margins for the Term Loan A facility and the revolving credit facility are subject to increase or decrease based upon our consolidated leverage ratio or
upon our credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Moody’s Investor Services Inc. at such time. There are no compensating balance requirements.

In October, 2010, we amended our accounts receivable securitization program (“Securitization”) with a group of conduit lenders
and liquidity banks. We increased the size of the Securitization to $240 million (the “Commitments”), from $200 million, and extended the maturity date to October 25, 2013. Substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable
of our acute care hospitals (“Receivables”) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings. The interest rate on the borrowings is based on the commercial paper rate plus a spread of .475% and there is a facility fee of .375% required
on 102% on the Commitments. We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings. We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization; the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to
special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us. The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except
through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities. The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks. The group of
third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans. We had $204 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to the terms of our accounts
receivable securitization program.

As of December 31, 2010, we had $3 million of outstanding borrowings under a
short-term, on-demand credit facility. Outstanding borrowings pursuant to this facility are classified as long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet since they can be refinanced through available borrowings under the terms of our Credit
Agreement.

As of December 31, 2010, we had an aggregate of $577 million of available borrowing capacity pursuant to the
terms of our Credit Agreement and Securitization, net of $71 million of outstanding letters of credit and $3 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to the short-term, on-demand note.

On November 15, 2010, in connection with our acquisition of PSI, we assumed $1.08 billion of PSI’s outstanding debt. As of
December 15, 2010, $1.05 billion of PSI’s outstanding borrowings, in addition to $29 million of call premiums and original issue discounts related to PSI’s senior subordinated notes, was repaid utilizing funds borrowed under our
Credit Agreement. In connection with PSI’s 7.75% senior subordinated notes due in 2015 (“PSI Notes”), we provided notice of redemption of all the PSI Notes and irrevocably deposited $632 million (the redemption price plus interest
through December 15, 2010) with the trustee on November 15, 2010 thereby satisfying and discharging our obligations under the PSI Notes.

On September 29, 2010, we issued $250 million of 7.00% senior unsecured notes (the “Unsecured Notes”) which are scheduled to mature on October 1, 2018. The funds generated from this
debt issuance were held in escrow until the November 15, 2010 completion date of the PSI acquisition. Interest on the Unsecured Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on April 1st and October 1st of each year. The Unsecured Notes
can be redeemed in whole at anytime subject to a make-whole call at treasury rate plus 50 basis points prior to October 1, 2014. They are also redeemable in whole or in part at a price of: (i) 103.5% on or after October 1, 2014; (ii) 101.75% on or
after October 1, 2015, and; (iii) 100% on or after October 1, 2016.

On June 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior
notes which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016 (the “7.125% Notes”). Interest on the 7.125% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 30th and December 30th of each year. In June, 2008, we issued an
additional $150 million of 7.125% Notes which formed a single series with the original 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2006. Other than their date of



issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to and trade interchangeably with, the 7.125% Notes which were originally issued in
June, 2006.

During 2001, we issued $200 million of senior notes which have a 6.75% coupon rate and which mature on
November 15, 2011 (the “6.75% Notes”). The interest on the 6.75% Notes is paid semiannually in arrears on May 15th and November 15th of each year. The 6.75% Notes can be redeemed in whole at any time and in part from time to
time. Since we expect to have the borrowing capacity, and intend to refinance the 6.75% Notes upon their maturity in November, 2011 utilizing borrowings under our Credit Agreement, they are classified as long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of December 31, 2010.

In connection with the entering into of the Credit Agreement on November 15, 2010,
and in accordance with the Indenture dated January 20, 2000 governing the rights of our existing notes, we entered into a supplemental indenture pursuant to which our 7.125% Notes (due in 2015) and our 6.75% Notes (due in 2011) will be equally
and ratably secured with the lenders under the Credit Agreement with respect to the collateral for so long as the lenders under the Credit Agreement are so secured.

The average amounts outstanding during 2010, 2009, and 2008 are under the Credit Agreement, Prior Credit Agreement, demand notes and accounts receivable securitization program were $610 million, $287
million and $431 million, respectively, with corresponding interest rates of 3.4%, 1.7%, and 3.9% including commitment and facility fees. The maximum amounts outstanding at any month-end were $3.11 billion in 2010, $356 million in 2009, and $566
million in 2008. The effective interest rate on our Credit Agreement, accounts receivable securitization program and demand notes, which includes the respective interest expense, commitment and facility fees, designated interest rate swaps expense
and amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts, was 5.0% in 2010, 3.9% in 2009, and 4.5% in 2008.

Our Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw. The Credit Agreement includes
covenants that include (1) a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens and indebtedness, transactions with affiliates and dividends; and (2) requires compliance financial covenants including maximum leverage and
minimum interest coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all required covenants as of December 31, 2010.

The fair
value of our long-term debt at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $3.96 billion and $1.02 billion respectively.

Aggregate
maturities follow:

5) COMMON STOCK

In November, 2009, we declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend which was paid on December 15, 2009 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2009. All classes of
common stock participated on a pro rata basis and, as required, references to share quantities, share prices and earnings per share for all periods presented or discussed have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.



Dividends

Cash dividends of $.20 per share ($19 million in the aggregate) was declared and paid during 2010, $.17 per share ($17 million in the
aggregate) were declared and paid during 2009 and $.16 per share ($16 million in the aggregate) were declared and paid during 2008.

Stock Repurchase Programs

During 1999, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007,
our Board of Directors approved stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase up to an aggregate of 43 million shares of our outstanding Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions
off the market. There is no expiration date for our stock repurchase programs. The following schedule provides information related to our stock repurchase programs for each of the three years ended December 31, 2010:

(a)

Includes 8,000 during 2010, 13,000 during 2009 and 50,500 during 2008 of restricted shares that were forfeited by former employees pursuant to the terms of our
restricted stock purchase plan.

Stock-based Compensation Plans

At December 31, 2010, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans. Pursuant to the FASB’s guidance, we expense
the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation pursuant to the straight-line method over the stated vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The expense associated with share-based compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,
share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities. The applicable FASB guidance requires that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized be
classified as financing cash flows. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, there were no net excess tax benefits generated.

Compensation
costs related to outstanding stock options were recognized as follows: (i) a pre-tax charge of $13.3 million ($8.3 million after-tax) or $.08 per diluted share during 2010; (ii) $9.9 million ($6.2 million after-tax) or $.06 per diluted
share during 2009, and; (iii) a pre-tax charge of $10.4 million ($6.4 million after-tax) or $.06 per diluted share during 2008. In addition, during the years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008, compensation costs of $3.1 million ($2.0 million
after-tax), $2.8 million ($1.8 million after-tax) and $3.4 million ($2.1 million after-tax), respectively, were recognized related to restricted stock.



We adopted the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended in 2008, (the “Stock Incentive
Plan”) which replaced our Amended and Restated 1992 Stock Option Plan which expired in July of 2005. An aggregate of fourteen million shares of Class B Common Stock has been reserved under the Stock Incentive Plan. There were 94,000, 2,499,750
and 2,665,500 stock options, net of cancellations, granted during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The per option weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $7.84, $7.93 and $3.08, respectively. Stock
options to purchase Class B Common Stock have been granted to our officers, key employees and directors under our above referenced stock option plans. All stock options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date
of the grant. Options are exercisable ratably over a four-year period beginning one year after the date of the grant. All outstanding options expire five years after the date of the grant.

The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions derived from averaging the number of options granted during the most recent five-year period that were granted or have vestings after January 1, 2006. The 2008 weighted-average assumptions were based upon twenty-two
option grants, the 2009 weighted-average assumptions were based upon nineteen option grants and the 2010 weighted-average assumptions were based upon seventeen option grants.

The risk-free rate is
based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon four year yield in effect at the time of grant. The expected life of the stock options granted was estimated using the historical behavior of employees. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility
for a period equal to the stock option’s expected life. Expected dividend yield is based on our actual dividend yield at the time of grant.

The table below summarizes our stock option activity during each of the last three years:



The following table provides information about unvested options for the year
December 31, 2010:

The following table provides information about all outstanding options, and exercisable options, at
December 31, 2010:

The total
in-the-money value of all stock options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2010 was $26.8 million.

The
weighted average remaining contractual life for options outstanding and weighted average exercise price per share for exercisable options at December 31, 2010 were as follows:

(a)

Assumes a weighted average forfeiture rate of 10.36%.

In addition to the Stock Incentive Plan, we have the following stock incentive and purchase plans: (i) the 2010 Employees’ Restricted Stock Purchase Plan (“2010 Plan”), which replaced
the Second Amended and Restated 2001 Employees’ Restricted Stock Purchase Plan (“2001 Plan”), which allows eligible participants to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock at par value, subject to certain restrictions, and;
(ii) a 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows eligible employees to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock at a ten percent discount. There were 94,955, 138,870 and 117,914 shares issued pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Compensation expense recorded in connection with this plan was $339,000, $316,000 and $328,000 during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

We have reserved 6.0 million shares of Class B Common Stock for issuance under these various plans (excluding terminated plans) and
have issued approximately 600,000 shares, net of cancellations, pursuant to the terms of these plans (excluding terminated plans) as of December 31, 2010.



The 2001 Plan, as described above, expired in March, 2010. Under this plan, we had
2.4 million shares of Class B Common Stock reserved for issuance and have issued approximately 1.2 million shares, net of cancellations, pursuant to the terms of this plan as of December 31, 2010, of which 313,770 became fully vested
during 2010, 31,638 became fully vested during 2009 and 296,400 became fully vested during 2008.

During the first quarter of
2010, pursuant to the 2001 Plan and prior to its expiration, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) approved the issuance of 49,472 restricted shares of our Class B Common Stock at $30.32 per share ($1.5
million in the aggregate) to our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chairman of the Board. These shares, which were issued pursuant to a provision in our CEO’s employment agreement, are scheduled to vest ratably on the first, second,
third and fourth anniversary dates of the grant, assuming our CEO remains employed by us. In the event that our CEO’s employment is terminated by reason of disability, death, without proper cause or due to breach of the CEO’s employment
agreement by us, the vesting of these awards will occur immediately. In connection with this grant, we recorded compensation expense of $355,000 during 2010 and the remaining expense associated with this award (estimated at $1.1 million as of
December 31, 2010) will be recorded over the remaining vesting periods of the award.

During the first quarter of 2009,
pursuant to the 2001 Plan, the Committee approved the issuance of 109,850 restricted shares of our Class B Common Stock at $20.26 per share ($2.2 million in the aggregate) to our CEO. These shares are scheduled to vest ratably on the first, second,
third and fourth anniversary dates of the grant and are subject to the same conditions and terms as mentioned above in connection with the grant of restricted shares during the first quarter of 2010. 27,463 of these shares became fully vested in
2010. In connection with this grant, we recorded compensation expense of $556,000 during 2010 and $482,000 during 2009 and the remaining expense associated with this award (estimated at $1.2 million as of December 31, 2010) will be recorded
over the remaining vesting periods of the award.

During the first quarter of 2008, pursuant to the 2001 Plan, the Committee
approved the issuance of 62,190 restricted shares of our Class B Common Stock at $24.12 per share ($1.5 million in the aggregate) to our CEO. These shares are scheduled to vest ratably on the first, second, third and fourth anniversary dates of the
grant and are subject to the same conditions and terms as mentioned above in connection with the grant of restricted shares during the first quarter of 2010. 15,548 of these shares became fully vested in each of 2010 and 2009. In connection with
this grant, we recorded compensation expense of $375,000 during each of 2010 and 2009 and $360,000 during 2008 and the remaining expense associated with this award (estimated at $390,000 as of December 31, 2010) will be recorded over the
remaining vesting periods of the award.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, pursuant to the 2001 Plan, the Committee approved
the issuance of 61,362 restricted shares of our Class B Common Stock at $24.45 per share ($1.5 million in the aggregate) to our CEO. These shares are scheduled to vest ratably on the first, second, third and fourth anniversary dates of the grant and
are subject to the same conditions and terms as mentioned above in connection with the grant of restricted shares during the first quarter of 2010. 15,341 of these shares became fully vested in 2010 and 15,340 of these shares became fully vested in
each of 2009 and 2008. In connection with this grant, we recorded compensation expense of $375,000 during each of 2010, 2009 and 2008. The remaining expense associated with this award (estimated at $333,000 as of December 31, 2010) will be
recorded over the remaining vesting periods of the award.

Additionally, during 2007, pursuant to the 2001 Plan, the Committee
approved the issuance of 22,250 restricted shares of our Class B Common stock at a weighted average of $29.62 per share ($659,000 in the aggregate) to various employees. These shares have various vesting schedules. We recorded compensation expense
of $135,000 during each of 2010, 2009 and 2008, in connection with these grants and the remaining expense associated with these awards (estimated at $162,000 as of December 31, 2010) will be recorded over the remaining vesting periods of the
awards, assuming the recipients remain employed by us.

During the fourth quarter of 2006, pursuant to the 2001 Plan, the
Committee approved the issuance of 247,000 restricted shares (net of cancellations) of our Class B Common Stock at $25.71 per share ($6.4 million in



the aggregate) to various officers and employees. These shares became fully vested in November, 2010. In connection with this grant, we recorded compensation expense of $1.3 million, $1.5 million
and $1.4 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

At December 31, 2010, 23,588,743 shares of Class B Common
Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans. Class A,
C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock.

In connection with the long-term
incentive plans described above, we recorded compensation expense of $3.5 million in 2010, $3.2 million in 2009 and $3.7 million in 2008. Including the stock option related compensation expense recorded pursuant to 123R, of $13.3 million in 2010,
$9.9 million in 2009 and $10.4 million in 2008, we recorded a total stock compensation expense of $16.8 million in 2010, $13.1 million in 2009 and $14.1 million in 2008.

6) INCOME TAXES

Components of income tax expense/(benefit) from continuing operations are as follows (amounts in thousands):



Deferred taxes are required to be classified based on the financial statement classification
of the related assets and liabilities which give rise to temporary differences. Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The components of deferred
taxes are as follows (amounts in thousands):

Increases in deferred tax assets relating to self-insurance reserves, compensation related accruals,
allowance for uncollectible patient accounts, and net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards as well as increases in deferred tax liabilities relating to depreciable and separately identifiable intangible assets primarily reflect the impact
of deferred taxes recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.

The effective tax rates, as
calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income from continuing operations before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in thousands):

The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in

Impacting the effective tax rates during 2010 were the following items: (i) $5 million
unfavorable discrete tax item recorded to adjust the non-deductible portion of certain transaction costs incurred during 2010 in connection with our acquisition of PSI; (ii) a $4 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded to adjust for the
non-deductible, $9 million charge incurred from split-dollar life insurance agreements entered into during 2010 on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife, partially offset by; (iii) a $4 million favorable discrete tax item
recorded during 2010 to adjust the estimated non-deductible portion of the previously disclosed South Texas Health System settlement with the government based upon the final agreement. Impacting the effective tax rates during 2009 was a $4 million
unfavorable discrete tax item related to the estimated non-deductible portion of the South Texas Health System settlement.

A
reconciliation between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate on continuing operations is as follows:

Included in “Other current assets” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet are prepaid federal
and state income taxes amounting to $51.2 million and $555,000 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The net
deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised as follows (amounts in thousands):

The assets and liabilities classified as current relate primarily to the allowance for uncollectible patient
accounts, compensation-related accruals and the current portion of the temporary differences related to self- insurance reserves. At December 31, 2010, state net operating loss carryforwards (expiring in years 2011 through 2030), and credit
carryforwards available to offset future taxable income approximated $662 million, representing approximately $33.3 million in deferred state tax benefit (net of the federal benefit). At December 31, 2010 related to the acquisition of
Psychiatric Solutions, Inc., there were federal net operating losses of $3.3 million expiring in 2022 representing approximately $1.1 million in deferred federal tax benefits, federal and state capital loss carryforwards of $9.0 million expiring in
2014 representing approximately $3.4 million in deferred federal and state tax benefit, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $10.6 million expiring through 2017 representing approximately $4.5 million in deferred foreign tax
benefit.

A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. Based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that certain of our state tax benefits will not be realized, therefore, valuation allowances of $27.8 million and $23.1 million have been reflected as of



December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During 2010, the valuation allowance on these state tax benefits increased by $3.1 million due to additional net operating losses incurred and an
increase of $1.6 million due to Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. In addition, there was a $4.5 million increase in the valuation allowance related to foreign net operating losses due to Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.

We adopted the provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes effective January 1, 2007. During 2010 and 2009, the
estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were increased in the amount of approximately $3.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years. The
increase in 2010 is primarily attributable to tax positions taken by Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. on pre-acquisition tax return years. Also during 2010, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties)
were reduced due to the lapse of the statute of limitations resulting in a net income tax benefit of approximately $1 million. The balance at December 31, 2010 and 2009, if subsequently recognized, that would favorably affect the effective tax rate
and the provision for income taxes is approximately $5 million and $4 million, respectively.

We recognize accrued interest
and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we have approximately $1 million of accrued interest and penalties. The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for
the 2007 and subsequent years. Foreign and U.S. state and local jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging for 3 to 4 years. The statute of limitations on certain jurisdictions could expire within the next twelve months. It is
reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next 12 months however it is anticipated that any such change, if it were to occur, would not have a material impact on our results of operations.

The tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows (amounts
in thousands).

7) LEASE COMMITMENTS

Certain of our hospital facilities are held under operating leases with Universal Health Realty Income Trust with terms expiring in 2011 through 2014 (see Note 9). Certain of these leases also contain
provisions allowing us to purchase the leased assets during the term or at the expiration of the lease at fair market value. We also lease the real property of certain facilities acquired by us in connection with the acquisition of PSI in November,
2010.

A summary of property under capital lease follows (amounts in thousands):



Future minimum rental payments under lease commitments with a term of more than one year as
of December 31, 2010, are as follows (amounts in thousands):

In the ordinary course of business, our facilities routinely lease equipment pursuant to
month-to-month lease arrangements that will likely result in future lease & rental expense in excess of the amounts indicated above. Capital lease obligations of $7.1 million in 2010, $700,000 in 2009 and $3.4 million in 2008 were incurred
when we assumed capital lease obligations upon the acquisition of facilities or entered into capital leases for new equipment.

8) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Professional and General Liability Claims and Property Insurance

Professional and General Liability

Effective January 1, 2008, most of our subsidiaries became self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence (as compared to $20 million per occurrence
prior to 2008). Prior to our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, our subsidiaries purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of $10 million up to $200 million per occurrence and in
the aggregate. However, we are liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.

Prior to our acquisition in November, 2010, the PSI facilities were commercially insured for professional and general liability insurance
claims in excess of a $3 million self-insured retention to a limit of $75 million. PSI utilized its captive insurance company to manage the self-insured retention and that captive insurance company remains in place after our acquisition of
PSI.

Since our acquisition of PSI on November 15, 2010, the former PSI subsidiaries are self-insured for professional
and general liability exposure up to $3 million per occurrence and our legacy subsidiaries (which are not former PSI subsidiaries) are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence. Effective November,
2010, our subsidiaries (including the former PSI subsidiaries) were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence self-insured retention (either $3
million or $10 million) up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.

Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including,
among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses



for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our
commercial insurance policies. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this
estimate. Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect
on our future results of operations.

Upon our acquisition of PSI, we conducted a thorough analysis of PSI’s claims and
related reserves and, with the assistance of an independent third-party actuary, we determined that the aggregate self-insured retention estimate for the pre-acquisition professional and general liability claims amounted to $51 million which is
included in our total accrual as of December 31, 2010, as discussed below.

As of December 31, 2010, the total
accrual for our professional and general liability claims, including the estimated claims related to the facilities acquired from PSI, was $289 million, of which $60 million is included in current liabilities. As of December 31, 2009, the total
accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $266 million, of which $46 million is included in other current liabilities.

Based upon the results of reserve analyses, we recorded reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $49 million during 2010 and $23
million during 2009. These favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments were due to: (i) an increased weighting given to company-specific metrics (to 75% from 50%), and decreased general industry metrics (to 25% from 50%), related
to projected incidents per exposure, historical claims experience and loss development factors; (ii) historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we
operate, and; (iii) a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years. As the number of our
facilities and our patient volumes have increased, thereby providing for a statistically significant data group, and taking into consideration our long-history of company-specific risk management programs and claims experience, our reserve analyses
have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends. Actuarially determined estimates for our 2011 provision for self-insured
professional and general liability claims were developed based upon similar metrics and weighting.

Property Insurance

Acute care facilities and legacy behavioral health care facilities

We have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit
per occurrence, subject to $250,000 deductible. Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property. In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies
covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses.). Our earthquake limit is $250 million, subject to a deductible of $250,000, except for facilities
located within documented fault zones. Earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the United States are subject to a $100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total
insurable value of the property. The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million. Flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility.

Behavioral health care facilities acquired in November, 2010

The newly acquired facilities formerly owned by PSI have all risk property coverage with a loss limit of $100 million with a $25,000
deductible. Earth movement losses, except California, are subject to an annual



aggregate loss limit of $100 million with a $50,000 per occurrence deductible. Earthquake coverage in California is further sub-limited to an annual aggregate loss limit of $50 million with a
deductible of 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property. Named windstorms are insured to $100 million per occurrence but are potentially subject to applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value of the
property. Flood losses are subject to an annual aggregate loss limit of $100 million with deductibles ranging from $50,000 to $100,000. Flood losses that occur in designated high hazard areas are sub-limited to $25 million with a $500,000
deductible.

Due to an increase in property losses experienced nationwide in recent years, the cost of commercial property
insurance has increased. As a result, catastrophic coverage for earthquake and flood has been limited to annual aggregate losses (as opposed to per occurrence losses). Given these insurance market conditions, there can be no assurance that a
continuation of these unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained by us, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

Legal Proceedings

U.S. v. Marion and UHS:

In late 2007, July, 2008 and January, 2009,
the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) issued a series of subpoenas seeking documents related to the treatment of Medicaid beneficiaries at two of our facilities, Marion Youth Center and
Mountain Youth Academy,. It was our understanding at that time that the OIG was investigating whether claims for reimbursement submitted by those facilities to the Virginia Medicaid program were supported by adequate documentation of the services
provided which could be considered to be a basis for a false claims act violation. In August, 2008, the Office of the Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Virginia issued a subpoena to Keystone Newport News, another of our facilities. It was our
understanding at that time that the Office of Attorney General was investigating whether Keystone Newport News complied with various Virginia laws and regulations, including documentation requirements.

In response to these subpoenas, we produced the requested documents on a rolling basis and we cooperated with the investigations in all
respects. We also met with representatives of the OIG, the Virginia Attorney General, the United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, and the United States Department of Justice Civil Division on several occasions to discuss a
possible resolution of this matter. However, the parties were not able to reach a resolution.

Consequently, in November,
2009, the United States Department of Justice and the Virginia Attorney General intervened in a qui tam case that had been filed by former employees of Marion Youth Center under seal in 2007 against Universal Health Services, Inc. (“UHS”),
and Keystone Marion, LLC and Keystone Education and Youth Services, LLC (“Keystone”). The Department of Justice and the Commonwealth of Virginia filed and served their complaint which, at present, relates solely to the Marion Youth Center.
The complaint originally alleged causes of action pursuant to the federal and state false claims acts, the Virginia fraud statute, and unjust enrichment. The former employees filed a separate amended complaint, alleging employment and retaliation
claims as well as false claim act violations. In April, 2010, the defendants in the lawsuit filed motions to dismiss the claims filed by the government and the former employees. In July, 2010, the court ruled on the motions, granting them in part
and denying them in part. The court has allowed the government to proceed with its claims under the federal and state false claims act and the Virginia fraud statute. In addition, the court has allowed the former employees to proceed with parts of
their employment related and retaliation claims. We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our financial statements. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously against the
government’s and the former employees’ allegations. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in the litigation or that the case will be limited to the Marion Youth Center.



Devore, et. al. v. Keystone Education and Youth Services, LLC:

Alicante School in California was acquired by a subsidiary of ours in October, 2005. Prior to our acquisition, two former employees of the
facility filed a false claim act qui tam action and a gender discrimination/whistleblower claim in Sacramento County Superior Court. The plaintiffs allege that the Alicante School improperly billed subdivisions of the state of California based upon
services provided at the school and that the plaintiffs were discriminated against based upon their gender and as a result of their objection to these practices. In June, 2008, we entered into an agreement with the former owners of the facility
whereby they agreed to defend the case, indemnify us and hold us harmless for any damages that may result from this case. The former owners of the facility had been funding the legal defense of this case since that time. Recently, the court
approved the agreed upon $9.5 million settlement of this matter which we paid to the plaintiffs in January, 2011. Since we have made a demand on the former owners of the facility for repayment, and intend to pursue collection of the $9.5 million
pursuant to the June, 2008 indemnification agreement (although we can provide no assurance that we will collect the entire $9.5 million), the settlement amount and related receivable is reflected in other current assets and other accrued liabilities
on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010.

Martin v. UHS of Delaware:

UHS of Delaware, Inc., a subsidiary, and one of our non-public schools in California operated by one of our subsidiaries have been named
as defendants in a state False Claim Act case in Sacramento County Superior Court. Plaintiffs are a former student and employees of the Elmira School who claim that the UHS Schools in California unlawfully retained public education funding from the
state of California for the operation of these schools but failed to meet state requirements to qualify as a non-public school. Plaintiffs have also claimed that we committed unfair business practices associated with these allegations. We deny
liability and intend to defend this case vigorously. We are presently uncertain as to the legal viability of the claims and are unable to determine the extent of potential financial exposure, if any, at this time.

Wage and Hour Class Actions:

Ethridge v. Universal Health Services et. al:

In June, 2008, we and one of
our acute care facilities, Lancaster Community Hospital, were named as defendants in a wage and hour lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court. This is a purported class action lawsuit alleging that the hospital failed to provide sufficient meal
and break periods to certain employees. In June, 2010 a settlement was reached with the attorneys for the class representative. The settlement was recently approved by the court. The reserve established for the settlement of this matter did not have
a material impact on our 2010 consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Other:

We and/or our subsidiaries are presently involved in three other wage and hour class action cases in California and Tennessee. Two of
those cases have been certified as a class by the California State Superior Court in Alameda County and the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, respectively. At present, we are uncertain as to the extent of potential
financial exposure but do not believe potential settlements or judgments in these cases will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Department of Justice ICD Investigation:

In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) advising of a False Claim Act
investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (“ICDs”) from 2003 to the present at several of our acute care facilities. The DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by
our facilities in



contravention of a National Claims Determination regarding these devices. At present, we are uncertain as to the extent of the claims, liability for such claims and potential financial exposure
in connection with this matter.

Other Matters

The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government
healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or
allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers. Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government
healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. We monitor all
aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving,
governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no
assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such
inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.

Southwest Healthcare System:

During the third quarter of 2009, Southwest Healthcare System (“SWHCS”), which operates Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland
Valley Regional Medical Center in Riverside County, California, entered into an agreement with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The agreement required SWHCS to engage an independent quality monitor to assist SWHCS in
meeting all CMS’ conditions of participation. Further, the agreement provided that, during the last 60 days of the agreement, CMS would conduct a full Medicare certification survey. That survey took place the week of January 11, 2010.

In April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from CMS that it intended to effectuate the termination of SWHCS’s Medicare
provider agreement effective June 1, 2010. In May, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CMS which abated the termination action scheduled for June 1, 2010. The agreement is one year in duration and required SWHCS to engage
independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for SWHCS to meet the Medicare conditions of participation. At the conclusion of the agreement, CMS will conduct a full certification survey to determine if SWHCS
has achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation. During the term of the agreement, SWHCS remains eligible to receive reimbursements from Medicare for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries.

Also in April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from the California Department of Public Health (“CDPH”) indicating that it
planned to initiate a process to revoke SWHCS’s hospital license. In May, 2010, SWHCS received the formal document related to the revocation action. In September, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CDPH relating to the license
revocation. The terms of the CDPH agreement are substantially similar to those contained in the agreement with CMS. As a result of the agreement, SWHCS’s hospital license remains in effect pending the outcome of the CMS full certification
survey which will occur at the end of the agreement. Pursuant to the results of the CMS full certification survey, which we anticipate occurring in mid-year, 2011, should SWHCS be deemed to have achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare
conditions of participation, CDPH shall deem SWHCS’s license to be in good standing. Failure of SWHCS to achieve substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, pursuant to CMS’s full certification survey, will likely
have a material adverse impact on SWHCS’s ability to continue to operate the facilities.



As a result of the matters discussed above, we were not previously permitted to open newly
constructed capacity at Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center. However, in February, 2011, we received permission from CDPH to begin accessing the new capacity. Unrelated to these developments, we expect a competitor to open
a newly constructed acute care hospital during the first quarter of 2011. We are unable to predict the net impact of these developments on SWHCS’s results of operations in 2011 and beyond.

Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center remain fully committed to providing high-quality healthcare to their
patients and the communities they serve. We therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with both CMS and CDPH in an effort to resolve these matters, although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. Failure to resolve
these matters could have a material adverse effect on us. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, SWHCS generated approximately 1.1% and 4.3%, respectively, of our income
from operations after income attributable to noncontrolling interest.

Matters Relating to PSI:

The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.) for which we have
assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition of PSI which was completed in November, 2010:

Garden City
Employees’ Retirement System v. PSI:

This is a purported shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States
District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against PSI and the former directors in 2009 alleging violations of federal securities laws. We are uncertain at this time as to potential liability and damages but intend to defend the case
vigorously.

Department of Justice Investigation of Sierra Vista:

In 2009, Sierra Vista Hospital in Sacramento, California learned of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”)
relating to Medicare services provided by the facility. The DOJ ultimately notified the facility that with respect to partial hospitalization and outpatient services, the DOJ believed that the medical record documentation did not
adequately support the claims submitted for reimbursement by Medicare. We recently reached a tentative financial settlement with the DOJ. The reserve established in connection with this matter did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations. As part of that agreement, the facility will be subject to a corporate integrity agreement, the terms of which have not yet been finalized.

Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:

In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility. The requested documents have been collected and provided
to the DOJ for review and examination. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.

Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital:

In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010. The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ and we continue to cooperate with the DOJ with respect to this investigation. At present, we are uncertain as
to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.



Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services Recoupment Claims:

The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (“DMAS”) has conducted audits at seven former PSI Residential Treatment
Centers operated in the Commonwealth of Virginia to confirm compliance with provider rules under the state’s Medicaid Provider Services Manual (“Manual”). As a result of those audits, DMAS claims the facilities failed to comply with
the requirements of the Manual and has requested repayment of Medicaid payments to those facilities. PSI had previously filed appeals to repayment demands at each facility which are currently pending.

General:

Currently, and from time to time, some of our other facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and
state agencies. If one of our facilities is found to have violated these laws and regulations, the facility may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure revocation, subjected to fines or
penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. We do not believe that, other than as described above, any such existing action would materially affect our consolidated financial position
or results of operations.

In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are
pending. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In addition to our long-term debt obligations as discussed in Note 4-

Long-Term Debt

and our operating lease obligations as discussed in Note 7-

Lease Commitments

, we have various other
contractual commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2010 as follows: (i) other combined estimated future purchase obligations of $178 million related to a long-term contract with third-parties consisting primarily of certain revenue
cycle data processing services for our acute care facilities ($82 million), expected costs to be paid to a third-party vendor in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application for each of our acute care
facilities ($81 million) and estimated minimum liabilities for physician commitments expected to be paid in the future ($15 million), and; (ii) combined estimated future payments of $255 million related to our non-contributory, defined benefit
pension plan ($220 million consisting of estimated payments through 2087), other retirement plan liabilities ($14 million) and deferred severance payments related to our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010 ($21 million).

As of December 31, 2010 we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds.
Our outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of December 31, 2010 totaled $76 million consisting of: (i) $63 million related to our self-insurance programs; (ii) $3 million related primarily to pending appeals of legal judgments
(including judgments related to professional and general liability claims), and; (iii) $10 million of other debt guarantees related to public utilities and entities in which we own a minority interest.

9) RELATIONSHIP WITH UNIVERSAL HEALTH REALTY INCOME TRUST AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust:

At December 31, 2010, we held approximately 6.2% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the
“Trust”). We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the Trust’s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities.
In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust. Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust
using the equity method of accounting. We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of



income, of approximately $1.8 million during 2010 and $1.6 million during each of 2009 and 2008. Our pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $1.0 million during 2010, $1.1 million during 2009
and $900,000 during 2008 and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year. The carrying value of this investment was $7.3 million and $8.1 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively,
and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The market value of this investment was $28.8 million at December 31, 2010 and $25.2 million at December 31, 2009, based on the closing price of the
Trust’s stock on the respective dates.

Total rent expense under the operating leases on the hospital facilities with the
Trust was $16.2 million during 2010, $16.3 million during 2009 and $16.1 million during 2008. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds
non-controlling ownership interests.

The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain properties from us and
immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries. Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5-year renewal terms.
Each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below. The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a
corresponding quarter in the base year. The leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.

Pursuant to the terms of the leases with the Trust, we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of
the then current term. In addition, we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or;
(ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer. We also have the right to purchase the respective leased facilities
at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at the appraised fair market value. In addition, during 2006, as part of the overall exchange and substitution transaction relating to Chalmette Medical Center (“Chalmette”) which was
completed during the third quarter of 2006, as well as the early five year lease renewals on Southwest Healthcare System-Inland Valley Campus (“Inland Valley”), Wellington Regional Medical Center (“Wellington”), McAllen Medical
Center and The Bridgeway (“Bridgeway”), the Trust agreed to amend the Master Lease to include a change of control provision. The change of control provision grants us the right, upon one month’s notice should a change of control of
the Trust occur, to purchase any or all of the four leased hospital properties at their appraised fair market value purchase price.

The table below details the renewal options and terms for each of our four hospital facilities leased from the Trust:

(a)

We have four 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2031).

(b)

We have two 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2021) and two 5-year renewal options at fair market value lease rates (2022 through 2031).

(c)

We have two 5-year renewal options at fair market value lease rates (2015 through 2024).



Split-dollar Life Insurance Agreements:

In December, 2010, our Board of Directors approved the Company’s entering into supplemental life insurance plans and agreements on
the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife. As a result of these agreements, based on actuarial tables and other assumptions, during the life expectancies of the insureds, we would pay approximately $25 million in premiums and certain
trusts, owned by our chief executive officer, would pay approximately $8 million in premiums. Based on the projected premiums mentioned above, and assuming the policies remain in effect until the death of the insureds, we will be entitled to receive
death benefit proceeds of no less than $33 million representing the $25 million of aggregate premiums paid by us as well as the $8 million of aggregate premiums paid by the trusts. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we paid approximately $6 million
in premium payments. We recorded a pre-tax and after-tax expense of $9 million during the fourth quarter of 2010 representing the present value of our projected premium funding commitment over the terms of the policies.

Other Related Party Transactions:

A member of our Board of Directors and member of the Executive Committee is Of Counsel to the law firm used by us as our principal outside counsel. This Board member is also the trustee of certain trusts
for the benefit of our CEO and his family. This law firm also provides personal legal services to our CEO.



10) PENSION PLAN

We maintain contributory and non-contributory retirement plans for eligible employees. Our contributions to the contributory plan amounted to $20.8 million, $20.4 million and $19.8 million in 2010, 2009
and 2008, respectively. The non-contributory plan is a defined benefit pension plan which covers employees of one of our subsidiaries. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee’s highest compensation for any five years of
employment. Our funding policy is to contribute annually at least the minimum amount that should be funded in accordance with the provisions of ERISA.

The following table shows the reconciliation of the defined benefit pension plan as of December 31, 2010 and 2009:

The accumulated benefit
obligation was $91,559 and $83,140 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. In 2010 and 2009, the accrued pension cost is
included in non-current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. We estimate that there will be $2,427 of net loss that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income over the next fiscal year.

Our pension plans assets were $73,402 and $61,290 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The market values of our pension plan
assets at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 by asset class were as follows:



To develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we considered the historical
returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio.

The following table shows expected benefit payments for the years ended December 31, 2011 through 2020 for our defined pension plan. There will be benefit payments under this plan beyond 2020.

Investment Policy, Guidelines and Objectives have been established for the defined benefit pension plan. The
investment policy is in keeping with the fiduciary requirements under existing federal laws and managed in accordance with the Prudent Investor Rule. Total portfolio risk is regularly evaluated and compared to that of the plan’s policy target
allocation and judged on a relative basis over a market cycle. The following asset allocation policy and ranges have been established in accordance with the overall risk and return objectives of the portfolio:

In accordance with the investment policy, the portfolio will invest in high quality, large
and small capitalization companies traded on national exchanges, and investment grade securities. The investment managers will not write or buy options for speculative purposes; securities may not be margined or sold short. The manager may employ
futures or options for the purpose of hedging exposure, and will not purchase unregistered sectors, private placements, partnerships or commodities.

11) SEGMENT REPORTING

Our reportable operating segments consist of acute care hospital services and behavioral health care services. The “Other” segment column below includes centralized services including
information services, purchasing, reimbursement, accounting, taxation, legal, advertising, design and construction and patient accounting as well as the operating results for our other operating entities including outpatient surgery and radiation
centers. The chief operating decision making group for our acute care hospital services and behavioral health care services is comprised of our Chief Executive Officer, the President and the Presidents of each operating segment. The Presidents for
each operating segment also manage the profitability of each respective segment’s various facilities. The operating segments are managed separately because each operating segment represents a business unit that offers different types of
healthcare services or operates in different healthcare environments. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2010.
