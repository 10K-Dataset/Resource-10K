UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES, INC.

2003 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT


This Annual Report on
Form 10-K is for the year ended December 31, 2003. This Annual Report modifies and supersedes documents filed prior to this Annual Report. Information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information
contained in this Annual Report. In this Annual Report, “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to Universal Health Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

You should carefully review all of the information contained in this Annual
Report, and should particularly consider any risk factors that we set forth in this Annual Report and in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the SEC. In this Annual Report, we state our beliefs of future events and of our
future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify those so-called “forward-looking statements” by words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,”
“anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of those words and other comparable words. You should be aware that those statements are only
our predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. In evaluating those statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risks outlined below. Those factors may cause our actual results to differ materially
from any of our forward-looking statements.

Factors Affecting Future Operations

Factors that may
cause our actual results to differ materially from any of our forward-looking statements presented in this Annual Report include, but are not limited to:

v

possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government programs, including Medicare or Medicaid;

v

industry capacity, demographic changes, existing laws and government regulations and changes in or failure to comply with laws and governmental regulations;



v

our ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms;

v

liability and other claims asserted against us;

v

competition from other healthcare providers, including physician owned facilities, and/or the loss of significant customers;

v

technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for healthcare;

v

our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including nurses, and our ability to recruit physicians to provide services at our facilities;

v

our ability to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions;

v

a significant portion of our revenues are produced by a small number of our facilities;

v

our ability to finance growth on favorable terms;

v

many of our acute care facilities continue to experience decreasing inpatient admission trends;

v

our acute care facilities continue to experience an increase in uninsured and self-pay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectibility of our patient accounts;

v

our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors (including amounts due from patients) and there can be no assurance that failure of the
payors to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;

v

we have experienced a significant increase in professional and general liability and property insurance expense caused by unfavorable pricing and availability trends of commercial
insurance and as a result, we have assumed a greater portion of our liability risk and consequently, there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in claims asserted against us, which are
self-insured, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, and;

v

other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.



PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

We are a Delaware corporation that was organized in 1979.

Our principal business is owning and operating through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers. As of March 1, 2004, we operated 48
acute care hospitals and 44 behavioral health centers located in 22 states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico and France. As part of our ambulatory treatment centers division, we own outright, or in partnership with physicians, and operate or manage 16
surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 9 states and Puerto Rico.

Services provided by our hospitals include:

•

general surgery

•

internal medicine

•

obstetrics

•

emergency room care

•

radiology

•

oncology

•

diagnostic care

•

coronary care

•

pediatric services

•

behavioral health services

We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance
and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.

Our principal executive offices are located at 367 South Gulph Road, King of Prussia, PA 19406. Our telephone number is (610) 768-3300. Universal Health
Services, Inc. has a web site at http://www.uhsinc.com. Copies of the annual, quarterly and current reports we file with the SEC, and any amendments to those reports, are available on our web site. The information posted on our web site is not
incorporated into this Annual Report.

We selectively seek
opportunities to expand our base of operations by acquiring, constructing or leasing additional hospital facilities. Such expansion may provide us with access to new markets and new health care delivery capabilities. We also seek to increase the
operating revenues and profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services, improvement of existing services, physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls. Pressures to contain health care costs
and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible. We are responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of
outpatient services. In addition, in response to cost containment pressures, we intend to implement programs designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while continuing to provide quality care, including more efficient use of
professional and paraprofessional staff, monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage, improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more efficient billing and collection procedures. We also continue to
examine our facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities that we believe do not have the potential to contribute to our growth or operating strategy.

We are involved in continual development activities. Applications to state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals are
currently on file in states which require certificates of need. Although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our operations, no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in
these efforts.



Recent and Proposed Acquisitions and Development Activities

During and subsequent to 2003, we proceeded with our development of new
facilities and consummated a number of acquisitions.

Effective
February 1, 2004 we acquired a 90% controlling ownership interest in Lakeland Medical Center, a 156-bed acute care facility located in New Orleans, Louisiana.

During October 2003 we opened Spring Valley Hospital Medical Center, a 176-bed acute care facility located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Spring Valley Hospital
Medical Center is owned by a limited liability company in which we have a 72.5% interest.

During 2003 we acquired: (i) the North Star Hospital and related treatment centers, a 108-bed behavioral health system in Anchorage and Palmer, Alaska; (ii) three acute care facilities located in France which were
acquired by an operating company that is 80% owned by us; (iii) three acute care facilities, all of which were ownership effective as of January 1, 2004, including Corona Regional Medical Center, a 228-bed acute care facility located in Corona,
California; French Medical Center, a 112-bed acute care facility located in San Luis Obispo, California, and; Arroyo Grande Community Hospital, a 65-bed acute care facility located in Arroyo Grande, California; (iv) the acquisition, which was
ownership effective as of January 1, 2004, of a 90% controlling ownership interest in Methodist Hospital, a 306-bed acute care facility located in New Orleans, Louisiana; (v) a behavioral health facility located in Alaska, and; (vi) an outpatient
surgery center located in Oklahoma.

Bed Utilization and Occupancy Rates

The following table shows the historical bed utilization
and occupancy rates for the hospitals operated by us for the years indicated. Accordingly, information related to hospitals acquired during the five year period has been included from the respective dates of acquisition, and information related to
hospitals divested during the five year period has been included up to the respective dates of divestiture.

Note:

Included in the Acute Care Hospitals beginning in 2001 is the data for twelve hospitals located in France owned by an operating company in which we purchased an 80% ownership
interest during 2001.



(1)

“Average Available Beds” is the number of beds which are actually in service at any given time for immediate patient use with the necessary equipment and staff available
for patient care. A hospital may have appropriate licenses for more beds than are in service for a number of reasons, including lack of demand, incomplete construction, and anticipation of future needs.

(2)

“Patient Days” is the sum for all patients of the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient.

(3)

“Occupancy Rate” is calculated by dividing average patient days (total patient days divided by the total number of days in the period) by the number of average beds,
either available or licensed.

The number of
patient days of a hospital is affected by a number of factors, including the number of physicians using the hospital, changes in the number of beds, the composition and size of the population of the community in which the hospital is located,
general and local economic conditions, variations in local medical and surgical practices and the degree of outpatient use of the hospital services. Current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in
reimbursement policies of third party payors. A continuation of such industry trends could have a material adverse impact upon our future operating performance. We have experienced growth in outpatient utilization over the past several years. We are
unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues because it is dependent upon developments in medical technologies and physician practice patterns, both of which are outside of our control. We are also unable to
predict the extent to which other industry trends will continue or accelerate.

Sources of Revenue

We receive payments for
services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients. All of our acute care hospitals (located
in the U.S. and Puerto Rico) and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities. The requirements for certification are subject to change, and, in order
to remain qualified for such programs, it may be necessary for us to make changes from time to time in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services. The costs for recertification are not material as many of the requirements for recertification
are a part of our internal quality control processes. If a facility loses certification, it will be unable to receive payment for patients under the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Although we intend to continue in such programs, there is no
assurance that we will continue to qualify for participation.

The sources of our hospital revenues are charges related to the services provided by the hospitals and their staffs, such as radiology, operating rooms, pharmacy, physiotherapy, and laboratory procedures, and basic charges for the hospital
room and related services such as general nursing care, meals, maintenance and housekeeping. Hospital revenues depend upon the occupancy for inpatient routine services, the extent to which ancillary services and therapy programs are ordered by
physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services. Charges and reimbursement rate for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of bed occupied (e.g.,
medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital.

McAllen Medical Center located in McAllen, Texas and Edinburg Regional Medical Center located in Edinburg, Texas operate within the same market. On a
combined basis, these two facilities contributed 10% in 2003 and 11% in both 2002 and 2001, of our consolidated net revenues and 12% in 2003 and 17% in both 2002 and 2001, of our consolidated earnings before depreciation, amortization, interest,
income taxes and items that are unusual in nature, (“EBITDA”), as itemized for each of the last three years in item 7 “Results of Operations” (after deducting an allocation of corporate overhead). We have a majority ownership
interest in four acute care hospitals in the Las Vegas, Nevada market. These four hospitals, Valley Hospital Medical Center, Summerlin Hospital Medical Center, Desert Springs Hospital and Spring Valley Hospital Medical Center (which opened in
October, 2003) on a combined basis, contributed 15% in both 2003 and 2002 and 16% in 2001 of our consolidated net revenues and 11% in 2003, 12% in 2002 and 13% in 2001 of our consolidated EBITDA.



The following table shows approximate percentages of net patient revenue derived from hospitals owned as
of December 31, 2003 since their respective dates of acquisition from third party sources, including the additional Medicaid reimbursements received at five acute care facilities located in Texas and one in South Carolina totaling $27.8 million in
2003, $33.0 in 2002, $32.6 million in 2001, $28.9 million in 2000, $37.0 million in 1999, and from all other sources during the five years ended December 31, 2003.

Regulation and Other Factors

A significant portion of our revenue is derived from
federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid (excluding managed Medicare and Medicaid programs), which accounted for 41%, 42% and 42% of our net patient revenues during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Under the statutory
framework of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, many of our operations are subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion that may affect payments made under either or both of such programs as well as by other third party payors.
Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustment that might result therefrom.

The federal government makes payments to participating hospitals under its Medicare program based on various formulas. For inpatient services, our general
acute care hospitals are subject to a prospective payment system (“PPS”) under which the hospitals are paid a predetermined amount per admission. The payment is based upon a diagnostic related group (“DRG”), for which payment
amounts are adjusted to account for geographic wage differences. For outpatient services, both general acute and behavioral health hospitals are paid under an outpatient prospective payment system (“OPPS”) according to ambulatory procedure
codes (“APC”) that group together services that are comparable both clinically and with respect to the use of resources, as adjusted to account for certain geographic wage differences. The Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Balanced Budget
Refinement Act of 1999 (“BBRA of 1999”) provided for certain “transitional corridor payments” to be made to hospitals during their transition from a service-based payment methodology to OPPS. The transitional payments were being
made through fiscal year 2003; however, due to the recent update of Medicare cost report cost to charge ratios to a more recent fiscal year, our hospitals did not qualify for transitional corridor payments in 2003.

Behavioral health facilities, which are generally excluded from the inpatient
services PPS, are reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis by the Medicare program, but are generally subject to a per discharge ceiling, calculated based on an annual allowable rate of increase over the hospital’s base year amount under the
Medicare law and regulations. Capital-related costs are exempt from this limitation. The discharge ceiling is higher for those hospitals that were excluded from PPS before October 1, 1997. Congress has required the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (“CMS”) to develop a per diem PPS for inpatient services furnished by behavioral health hospitals under the Medicare program. This PPS is to include an adequate patient classification system that reflects the differences in
patient resource use and costs among these hospitals and must maintain budget neutrality. Although Congress had mandated that this new PPS be effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002, there have been considerable
delays. We expect the implementation of this PPS for inpatient services furnished by behavioral health hospitals to be delayed until at least the fourth



quarter of 2004 or the first quarter of 2005. Although we believe the implementation of inpatient PPS may have a favorable effect on our future results of
operations, we cannot predict the ultimate effect of behavioral health inpatient PPS on our future operating results until the provisions are finalized.

There are also a number of other more general federal regulatory trends and factors affecting our business. Federal legislation continues to call for the
government to trim the growth of federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid, including reductions in the future rate of increases to payments made to hospitals, to reduce the amount of payments for outpatient services, bad debt expense and capital
costs. In federal fiscal year 2003, hospitals were receiving less than a full market basket inflation adjustment for services paid under the inpatient PPS (inpatient PPS update of the market basket minus 0.55 percentage points is 2.95% in fiscal
year 2003), although CMS estimates that for the same time period, Medicare payment rates under OPPS were to increase, for each service, by an average of 3.7%. Under the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, which was signed into law in November 2003,
the update was restored to the full market basket for fiscal year 2004; however, for fiscal years 2005 through 2007, operating updates equal to the market basket will be granted only to those hospitals that submit data on the ten quality indicators
established by CMS. Our hospitals intend to submit the required quality data to CMS. In addition, in February, 2003, the federal fiscal year 2003 omnibus spending federal legislation included approximately $800 million in increased spending for
hospitals. More specifically, $300 million of this amount was targeted for rural and certain urban hospitals effective for the period of April, 2003 through September, 2003. Certain hospitals of ours were eligible for and received the increased
Medicare reimbursement resulting from this legislation which amounted to approximately $3 million during 2003. For federal fiscal year 2004, CMS will increase the inpatient Medicare unadjusted standard base rate by a full market basket increase of
3.4%, absent any legislative action by Congress. However, this Medicare payment increase will be mitigated by changes in other factors that directly impact a hospital’s DRG payment including, but not limited to, annual Medicare wage index
updates, expansion of the DRG transfer payment policy and the annual recalibration of DRG relative payment weights.

Certain Medicare inpatient hospital cases with extraordinarily high costs in relation to other cases within a given DRG may receive an additional payment
from Medicare (“Outlier Payments”). In general, to qualify for the additional Outlier Payments, the gross charges associated with an individual patient’s case must exceed the applicable DRG plus a threshold established annually by
CMS. In the federal 2003 fiscal year, the unadjusted Outlier Payment threshold increased to $33,560 from $21,025. In the federal 2004 fiscal year, the threshold will be reduced to $31,000. Outlier Payments are currently subject to multiple factors
including but not limited to: (i) the hospital’s estimated operating costs based on its historical ratio of costs to gross charges; (ii) the patient’s case acuity; (iii) the CMS established threshold, and; (iv) the hospital’s
geographic location. However, in June, 2003, CMS issued a final rule that changes the outlier formula in an effort to promote more accurate spending for outlier payments to hospitals. We believe the change in the Outlier Payment methodology will
result in a decrease in the overall Outlier Payments expected to be received by us during the 2004 federal fiscal year. This decrease is expected to significantly offset the increase in Medicare payments resulting from the market basket inflation
adjustment as mentioned above. Our total Outlier Payments were less than 0.5% of our consolidated net revenues in 2003, less than 1% in 2002 and are expected to be less than 0.5% of consolidated net revenues in 2004.

Within certain limits, a hospital can manage its costs, and to the extent
this is done effectively, a hospital may benefit from the DRG system. However, many hospital operating costs are incurred in order to satisfy licensing laws, standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
(“JCAHO”) and quality of care concerns. In addition, hospital costs are affected by the level of patient acuity, occupancy rates and local physician practice patterns, including length of stay and number and type of tests and procedures
ordered. A hospital’s ability to control or influence these factors which affect costs is, in many cases, limited.

On August 1, 2003, CMS published a new final rule that makes certain changes to the inpatient PPS. Among the changes made by this new rule, as amended, is
an expansion of the definition of when the discharge of a hospital patient must be considered a transfer for Medicare payment purposes. Under the new rule, a discharge will now result in a transfer if the patient discharge is assigned to one of
twenty-nine DRGs, as opposed to one of



ten which previously applied. The rule also addresses other issues that may impact us, including certain changes to the DRG classifications and updates to
the wage index. Although we do not believe that this new rule will have a material adverse impact on our future results from operations, there can be no assurance that the provisions of the rule will not result in adverse effects on our business or
financial results.

On September 9, 2003, CMS published a final
rule clarifying policies relating to the responsibilities of Medicare-participating hospitals in treating individuals with emergency medical conditions who are presented to a hospital under the provisions of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor
Act (“EMTALA”). The clarifications in the final rule relate to, among other areas, seeking prior authorization from insurers for services, emergency patients presented at off-campus outpatient clinics that do not routinely provide
emergency services, the applicability of the EMTALA provisions to hospital inpatients and outpatients, the circumstances under which physicians must serve on hospital medical staff “on-call” lists, and the responsibilities of
hospital-owned ambulances. We do not believe that this new rule will have a material adverse impact on our future results from operations.

In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or
from managed care companies managing Medicaid with a large concentration of our Medicaid revenues received from Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. We can provide no assurance that reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the
above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Furthermore, we can provide no assurances that future reductions to federal and/or state budgets that contain certain further reductions or
decreases in the rate of increase of Medicare and Medicaid spending, will not adversely affect our future operations.

In 1991, the Texas legislature authorized the LoneSTAR Health Initiative, a pilot program in two areas of that state, to establish for Medicaid
beneficiaries a healthcare delivery system based on managed care principles. The program is now known as the STAR program, which is short for State of Texas Access Reform. Since 1995, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, with the help of
other Texas agencies such as the Texas Department of Health, has rolled out STAR Medicaid managed care pilot programs in several geographic areas of the state. Under the STAR program, the Texas Department of Health either contracts with health
maintenance organizations in each area to arrange for covered services to Medicaid beneficiaries, or contracts directly with healthcare providers and oversees the furnishing of care in the role of the case manager. Two carve-out pilot programs are
the STAR+PLUS program, which provides long-term care to elderly and disabled Medicaid beneficiaries in the Harris County service area, and the NorthSTAR program, which furnishes behavioral health services to Medicaid beneficiaries in the Dallas
County service area. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission is currently seeking a waiver to extend a limited Medicaid benefits package to low income persons with serious mental illness. The waiver is limited to individuals residing in
Harris County or the NorthSTAR service areas. Effective in the fall of 1999, however, the Texas legislature imposed a moratorium on the implementation of additional pilot programs until the 2001 legislative session. While Texas Senate Bill 1,
effective September 1, 2001, directed the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (the “Commission”) to implement Medicaid cost containment measures including a statewide rollout of the primary care case management program in non-STAR
areas, expansion of this program has been delayed in response to concerns from hospitals and physicians. Texas House Bill 2292, which passed in the 2003 legislative session requires that the Commission use the most cost-effective model of managed
care, as determined by the Commission. Such actions could have a material unfavorable impact on the reimbursement the Texas hospitals receive during the period of September, 2003 to September, 2005.

Upon meeting certain conditions, and serving a disproportionately high share
of Texas’ and South Carolina’s low income patients, five of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina became eligible and received additional reimbursement from each state’s disproportionate share
hospital (“DSH”) fund. To qualify for DSH funds in Texas, the facility must have either a disproportionate total number of inpatient days for Medicaid patients, a disproportionate percentage of all inpatient days that are for Medicaid
patients, or a disproportionate percentage of all inpatient days that are for low-income patients. Included in our financial results was an aggregate of $27.8 million in 2003, $33.0 million in 2002 and $32.6 in 2001 million



related to DSH programs. In February 2003, the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) published
a report indicating that Texas Medicaid may have overpaid Texas hospitals for DSH payments. In addition, in June 2003, the Commission proposed rules which would offset negative Medicaid shortfalls in the hospital-specific cap formula, and include
third-party and upper payment limit payments in the shortfall calculation. If adopted, these changes could result in reduced payments to our hospitals located in Texas that have significant Medicaid populations. The Texas program has been renewed
for the 2004 fiscal year and we expect the Texas DSH reimbursements to closely approximate amounts received during the state’s 2003 fiscal year. However, South Carolina’s DSH program has not yet been renewed for the 2004 fiscal year and we
cannot predict if it will be renewed for the state’s 2004 fiscal year, or any future year. During South Carolina’s 2003 fiscal year, we received $5.5 million of DSH payments. Failure to renew the Texas program beyond its scheduled
termination date (August 31, 2004), failure of our hospitals that currently receive DSH payments to qualify for future DSH funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements (including reductions related to the potential Texas Medicaid
overpayments mentioned above), could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including among others those related to government healthcare participation
requirements, various licensure and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse provisions (including, but not limited to, federal statutes and
regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources, false claims submitted to federal health care programs and self-referrals by physicians). Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and
regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to significant fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from government for previously billed patient services. Although management believes
its policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to governmental inquiries or actions, or that we would not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties if so
subjected. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact us.

Pressures to control health care costs and a shift away from traditional Medicare to Medicare managed care plans have
resulted in an increase in the number of patients whose health care coverage is provided under managed care plans. Approximately 41% in 2003, 39% in 2002 and 37% in 2001, of our net patient revenues were generated from managed care companies, which
includes health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs. In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow. The consequent growth in
managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate. Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we it do from
traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years, we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies.

The federal physician self-referral and payment prohibitions (codified in 42 U.S.C. Section 1395nn, Section 1877 of the
Social Security Act) generally forbid, absent qualifying for one of the exceptions, a physician from making referrals for the furnishing of any “designated health services,” for which payment may be made under the Medicare or Medicaid
programs, to any entity with which the physician (or an immediate family member) has a “financial relationship.” The legislation was effective January 1, 1992 for clinical laboratory services (“Stark I”) and January 1, 1995 for
ten other designated health services (“Stark II”). A “financial relationship” under Stark I and II includes any direct or indirect “compensation arrangement” with an entity for payment of any remuneration, and any
direct or indirect “ownership or investment interest” in the entity. The legislation contains certain exceptions including, for example, where the referring physician has an ownership interest in a hospital as a whole or where the
physician is an employee of an entity to which he or she refers. The Stark I and II self-referral and payment prohibitions include specific reporting requirements providing that each entity providing covered items or services must provide certain
information concerning its ownership, investment, and compensation arrangements. In August 1995, CMS published a final rule regarding physician self-referrals for clinical lab services (Stark I). On January 4, 2001, CMS published a portion of the
final rules regarding physician



self referrals for the ten other designated health services (Stark II). The remaining portions of the final rule for Stark II are still forthcoming.
Penalties for violating Stark I and Stark II include denial of payment for any services rendered by an entity in violation of the prohibitions, civil money penalties of up to $15,000 for each offense, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid
programs.

The federal anti-kickback statute (codified in 42
U.S.C. Section 1320a-7b(b)) prohibits individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration to other individuals and entities (directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in
kind):

1.

in return for referring an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made under a federal or state
health care program; or

2.

in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made under
a federal or state health care program.

Starting
in 1991, the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) issued regulations which provide for “safe harbors” from the federal anti-kickback statute; if an arrangement or transaction meets each of the
standards established for a particular safe harbor, the arrangement will not be subject to challenge by the Inspector General. If an arrangement does not meet the safe harbor criteria, it will be subject to scrutiny under its particular facts and
circumstances to determine whether it violates the federal anti-kickback statute. Safe harbors include protection for certain limited investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, personal service/management contracts, sales of a physician
practice, referral services, warranties, employees, discounts and group purchasing arrangements, among others. The criminal sanctions for a conviction under the anti-kickback statute include imprisonment, fines, or both. Civil sanctions include
exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs.

Many
states have also enacted similar illegal remuneration statutes that apply to healthcare services reimbursed by private insurance, not just those reimbursed by a federal or state health care program. In many instances, the state statutes provide that
any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes.

We do not anticipate that the Stark provisions, the anti-kickback statute or similar state law provisions will have material adverse effects on our
operations. However, in consideration of the current health care regulatory atmosphere, we cannot provide any assurance that federal or state authorities would not attempt to challenge one or more of our business dealings in consideration of one of
these federal or state provisions, or that if challenged that the authorities might not prevail.

Several states, including Florida and Nevada, have passed legislation which limits physician ownership in medical facilities providing imaging services,
rehabilitation services, laboratory testing, physical therapy and other services. This legislation is not expected to significantly affect our operations. Many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and
fee-splitting with physicians. We do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements.

All hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local statutes and regulations and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care, equipment and
cleanliness. Our hospitals must comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal, state and local health agencies, as well as the requirements of municipal building codes, health codes and local fire departments. In
granting and renewing licenses, a department of health considers, among other things, the physical buildings and equipment, the qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff, the quality of care and continuing compliance with the
laws and regulations relating to the operation of the facilities. State licensing of facilities is a prerequisite to certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense
narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive



materials and operate certain equipment. All our eligible hospitals have been accredited by JCAHO. JCAHO reviews each hospital’s accreditation once
every three years. The review period for each state’s licensing body varies, but generally ranges from once a year to once every three years.

The Social Security Act and regulations thereunder contain numerous provisions which affect the scope of Medicare coverage and the basis for reimbursement
of Medicare providers. Among other things, this law provides that in states which have executed an agreement with the Secretary of HHS, Medicare reimbursement may be denied with respect to depreciation, interest on borrowed funds and other expenses
in connection with capital expenditures which have not received prior approval by a designated state health planning agency. Additionally, many of the states in which our hospitals are located have enacted legislation requiring certificates of need
(“CON”) as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services. Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in the inability to complete an acquisition or
change of ownership, the imposition of civil or, in some cases, criminal sanctions, the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility’s license. We have not experienced and do not expect to experience
any material adverse effects from those requirements.

Health
planning statutes and regulatory mechanisms are in place in many states in which we operate. These provisions govern the distribution of healthcare services, the number of new and replacement hospital beds, administer required state CON laws,
contain healthcare costs, and meet the priorities established therein. Significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states, including increases in the capital spending thresholds and exemptions of various services from review
requirements. We are unable to predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.

Federal regulations provide that admissions and utilization of facilities by Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to insure efficient utilization of facilities and services. The law and regulations
require Peer Review Organizations (“PROs”) to review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of DRG classifications and the appropriateness of cases of
extraordinary length of stay. PROs may deny payment for services provided, assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to HHS that a provider that is in substantial non-compliance with the standards of the PRO be excluded from
participating in the Medicare program. We have contracted with PROs in each state where we do business as to the scope of such functions.

Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and
regulations. In 1988, Congress passed the Medical Waste Tracking Act (42 U.S.C. (S) 6992). Infectious waste generators, including hospitals, now face substantial penalties for improper arrangements regarding disposal of medical waste, including
civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day of noncompliance, criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day, imprisonment, and remedial costs. The comprehensive legislation establishes programs for medical waste treatment and disposal in designated
states. The legislation also provides for sweeping inspection authority in the Environmental Protection Agency, including monitoring and testing. We believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws.

Privacy and Security Requirements under the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996

The confidentiality of
patient medical records and other health information is subject to considerable regulation by state and federal governments. Legislation and regulations governing the dissemination and use of medical record information are being proposed continually
at both the state and federal levels. For example, the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) mandate that standards and requirements be adopted for the
electronic transmission of certain health information. The Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has issued regulations to comport with this mandate to create standards for unique health care services provider identifiers and
security requirements. In August 2002, HHS issued final modifications to the rule regarding privacy standards covering health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers (called “covered entities”).



Our facilities, which are covered entities, were required to comply with the provisions of this final
rule by April 14, 2003. In addition, HHS has published final regulations adopting standards for specific types of electronic administrative and financial health care transactions and for the code sets used in conjunction with those transactions.
Covered entities were required to comply with these regulations no later than October 16, 2003. Because violation of these HIPAA regulations may result in significant fines against us, we applied for and received an extension of the compliance
deadline. We are employing best efforts to assure that our policies, procedures and electronic billing practices comply with these regulations. We do not expect that the implementation of or compliance with these standards will have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Nonetheless, because the standards imposed by these regulations are very complex, it is still uncertain what the costs of complying with these standards will be. Accordingly, there
can neither be any assurance that we will not be subjected to governmental inquiries, actions or fines relating to these regulations, nor that the implementation of the HIPAA standards will not affect our financial condition or the future results of
operations. In addition, failure by third parties on which we rely, including payors, to resolve HIPAA related implementation issues could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to provide health care services.

Medical Staff and Employees

Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to
the medical staff of individual hospitals. With a few exceptions, physicians are not employees of our hospitals and members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their
affiliation with our hospitals at any time. Each of our hospitals are managed on a day-to-day basis by a managing director employed by us. In addition, a Board of Governors, including members of the hospital’s medical staff, governs the
medical, professional and ethical practices at each hospital. Our facilities had approximately 35,000 employees on December 31, 2003, of whom approximately 23,650 were employed full-time.

Approximately, 2,200 of our employees at eight of our hospitals are unionized. At Valley Hospital, unionized employees
belong to the Culinary Workers and Bartenders Union, the International Union of Operating Engineers and the Service Employees International Union. Registered nurses at Auburn Regional Medical Center located in Washington, are represented by the
United Staff Nurses Union, the technical employees are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers, and the service employees are represented by the Service Employees International Union. At The George Washington University Hospital,
unionized employees are represented by the Service Employees International Union. Nurses and technicians at Desert Springs Hospital are represented by the Service Employees International Union. Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, certain
technicians and therapists, pharmacy assistants, and some clerical employees at HRI Hospital in Boston are represented by the Service Employees International Union. Registered Nurses at Arroyo Grande Community Hospital and French Hospital Medical
Center are represented by the California Nurses Association. Unionized employees at Caribbean Pediatric and Surgery Hospital in Puerto Rico are represented by the Labor Union of Nurses and Health Employees. We believe that our relations with our
employees are satisfactory.

Competition

In all geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals
which provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals, some of which are owned by governmental agencies and supported by tax revenues, and others of which are owned by nonprofit corporations and may be supported to a large extent by
endowments and charitable contributions. Such support is not available to our hospitals. Certain of our competitors have greater financial resources, are better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us. Outpatient treatment and
diagnostic facilities, outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical centers also impact the healthcare marketplace. In recent years, competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the United States due to,
among other things, regulatory and technological changes, increasing use of managed care payment systems, cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment.



In addition, certain hospitals which are located in the areas served by our facilities are special
service hospitals providing medical, surgical and behavioral health services that are not available at our hospitals or other general hospitals. The competitive position of a hospital is to a large degree, dependent upon the number and quality of
staff physicians. Although a physician may at any time terminate his or her affiliation with a hospital, our hospitals seek to retain doctors of varied specializations on their staffs and to attract other qualified doctors by improving facilities
and maintaining high ethical and professional standards. In addition, in certain markets, including McAllen, Texas, competition from other healthcare providers, including physician owned facilities, has increased. A continuation of the increased
provider competition in the markets in which our hospital facilities operate could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

General and Professional Liability

Due to unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional and general liability insurance markets, our subsidiaries have assumed a greater
portion of the hospital professional and general liability risk. As a result, effective January 1, 2002, most of our subsidiaries were self-insured for malpractice exposure up to $25 million per occurrence. We purchased an umbrella excess policy for
our subsidiaries through a commercial insurance carrier for coverage in excess of $25 million per occurrence with a $75 million aggregate limitation.

For the period from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2001, most of our subsidiaries were covered under commercial insurance policies with PHICO, a
Pennsylvania based insurance company that was placed into liquidation during the first quarter of 2002. As a result of PHICO’s liquidation, we recorded a $40 million pre-tax charge during 2001 to reserve for PHICO claims that could become our
liability, however, we are entitled to receive reimbursement from state insurance guaranty funds, other commercial insurers and/or PHICO’s estate for a portion of certain claims ultimately paid by us.

Our estimated liability for professional and general liability claims is
based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims
based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially
from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.

As of December 31, 2003, the total reserve for our professional and general liability claims, was $190.8 million ($147.7 million net of expected recoveries from state guaranty funds), of which $35.0 million is
included in other current liabilities. As of December 31, 2002, the total reserve for our professional and general liability claims was $168.2 million ($131.2 million net of expected recoveries from state guaranty funds), of which $12 million is
included in other current liabilities. Included in other assets was $43.0 million as of December 31, 2003, and $37.0 million as of December 31, 2002, related to estimated expected recoveries from various state guaranty funds, insurance companies and
other sources in connection with PHICO related professional and general liability claims payments.

Given these insurance market conditions, there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in claims asserted
against us, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust

At December 31, 2003, we held approximately 6.6% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the “Trust”). We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory
agreement. Pursuant to the terms of this advisory agreement, we conduct the Trust’s day to day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities. In addition, some of our officers and directors are also officers
and/or directors of the Trust. Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for the investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting. Our pre-tax share of income from
the Trust was $1.6 million during 2003, $1.4 million during 2002 and $1.3 million during 2001, and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The carrying value of this investment was $9.4 million and $9.1
million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The market value of this investment was $23.4 million at December 31, 2003 and $20.3 million at December 31, 2002.



As of December 31, 2003, we leased six hospital facilities from the Trust with terms expiring in 2004
through 2008. These leases contain up to six 5-year renewal options. Future minimum lease payments to the Trust are included in Note 7. Total rent expense under these operating leases was $17.4 million in 2003, $17.2 million in 2002 and $16.5
million in 2001. The terms of the lease provide that in the event we discontinue operations at the leased facility for more than one year, we are obligated to offer a substitute property. If the Trust does not accept the substitute property offered,
we are obligated to purchase the leased facility back from the Trust at a price equal to the greater of its then fair market value or the original purchase price paid by the Trust. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several
medical office buildings owned by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds non-controlling majority ownership interests. As of December 31, 2003, the aggregate fair market value of our facilities leased from the Trust is not known,
however, the aggregate original purchase price paid by the Trust for these properties was $112.5 million. We received an advisory fee from the Trust of $1.5 million in 2003, $1.4 million in 2002 and $1.3 million in 2001 for investment and
administrative services provided under a contractual agreement which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Operations and Financial Condition

Overview

Our principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers and ambulatory surgery and
radiation oncology centers. As of March 1, 2004, we operated 48 acute care hospitals and 44 behavioral health centers located in 22 states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico and France. As part of our ambulatory treatment centers division, we manage and
own outright or in partnership with physicians, 16 surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 9 states and Puerto Rico. Included in the



facilities mentioned above were 3 acute care hospitals located in California and one acute care hospital located in Louisiana which were ownership effective
on January 1, 2004. We also acquired an additional acute care facility located in Louisiana effective February 1, 2004.

Net revenues from our acute care hospitals (including the facilities located in France) and our ambulatory and radiation oncology centers accounted for
83%, 82% and 81% of consolidated net revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities accounted for 17%, 17% and 19%, of consolidated net revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Services provided by our hospitals include general surgery,
internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services and behavioral health services. We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities,
including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors

The matters discussed in this report as well as our news releases issued
from time to time include certain statements containing the words “believes”, “anticipates”, “intends”, “expects” and words of similar import, which constitute “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause industry results and/or our actual results, performance or achievements
to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among other things, the following:

•

possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government programs, including Medicare or Medicaid;

•

industry capacity, demographic changes, existing laws and government regulations and changes in or failure to comply with laws and governmental regulations;

•

our ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms;

•

liability and other claims asserted against us;

•

competition from other healthcare providers, including physician owned facilities, and/or the loss of significant customers;

•

technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for healthcare;

•

our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including nurses, and our ability to recruit physicians to provide services at our facilities;

•

our ability to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions;

•

a significant portion of our revenues are produced by a small number of our facilities;

•

our ability to finance growth on favorable terms;

•

many of our acute care facilities continue to experience decreasing inpatient admission trends;

•

our acute care facilities continue to experience an increase in uninsured and self-pay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectibility of our patient accounts;

•

our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors (including amounts due from patients) and there can be no assurance that failure of the
payors to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;



•

we have experienced a significant increase in professional and general liability and property insurance expense caused by unfavorable pricing and availability trends of commercial
insurance and as a result, we have assumed a greater portion of our liability risk and consequently, there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in claims asserted against us, which are
self-insured, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, and;

•

other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Given these uncertainties, prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We disclaim
any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

A summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in Note 1 to the
financial statements. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements, including the following:

Revenue Recognition:

We record revenues and the related receivables
for health care services at the time the services are provided. We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates. Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates
per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges, and per diem payments. We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients, third-party payors, and others for services rendered, including estimated
retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third-party payors. We accrued retroactive adjustments on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are
determined.

Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 41%,
42% and 42% of our net revenues during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 41%, 39% and 37% of our revenues
during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will
change by material amounts in the near term. The large majority of the revenues generated by the acute care hospitals owned by our French subsidiary are paid by the government based on predetermined rates established in May of each year and consist
of a per diem payment and per procedure rate plus reimbursement for certain supplies.

We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than established rates. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify
as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or accounts receivable, net.

Provision for Doubtful Accounts:

Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts and the portion of the account which is the patient’s responsibility, consisting
primarily of co-payments and deductibles. We estimate provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience. We routinely review accounts receivable balances
in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectibility of the patient accounts and make adjustments to the provision for doubtful accounts as warranted. Significant changes in business office
operations, payor mix, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flow and results of operations.



Self-Insured Risks:

We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general
and professional liability claims and workers’ compensation claims, based on estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred by not reported. Estimated losses from asserted and incurred but not yet reported claims
are accrued based on our estimates of the ultimate costs of the claims, which includes costs associated with litigating or settling claims, and the relationship of past reported incidents to eventual claims payments. All relevant information,
including our own historical experience, the nature and extent of existing asserted claims and reported incidents, and independent actuarial analyses of this information, is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. We also consider amounts
that may be recovered from excess insurance carriers, state guarantee funds and other sources in estimating our ultimate net liability for such risk.

In addition, we also maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for workers’ compensation and employee healthcare and dental claims. The
ultimate costs related to these programs includes expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.

Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary,
at each reporting date. The amounts of the changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.

Long-Lived Assets:

In accordance with SFAS No.144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets”, we review our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is
based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow. If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its
estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.

Goodwill:

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, we ceased amortizing goodwill
as of January 1, 2002. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level as, defined by SFAS No. 142, on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators
are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit. We have designated September 1

st

as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2003, which indicated no impairment of goodwill. Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and
market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill.

Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future
years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets and therefore no valuation
allowances have been recorded.

We operate in multiple
jurisdictions with varying tax laws. We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities. Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service and various state authorities through the year ended December 31, 1999. The Internal
Revenue Service recently commenced a routine examination of the subsequent years. We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal and state taxes.

Results of Operations

We believe that operating income, operating margin and adjusted net income (as calculated below), which are non-GAAP financial measures (“GAAP”
is Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), are helpful to our



investors as measures of our operating performance. Since the source of financing for the purchase of property and equipment and other assets at each
hospital varies, we believe that measuring operating performance before capital-related costs (such as depreciation and amortization, lease and rental and interest expense) provides a useful comparison of relative operating performance among our
facilities. Operating income and operating margin are used by management as analytical indicators for purposes of assessing the relative operating performance of our individual hospitals and operating segments, and the overall Company. Also, our use
of operating income and operating margin enables investors to compare our performance with that of others in the industry. In addition, we believe that comparing and discussing our financial results based on adjusted net income, as calculated, is
helpful to our investors since it neutralizes the effect in each year of items that are unusual in nature such as recovery of provision for judgment/closure costs, gains on sales of assets and businesses, provision for asset impairment, provision
for insurance settlements, losses on early termination of interest rate swaps and debt extinguishment and goodwill amortization (which we ceased amortizing on January 1, 2002 pursuant to SFAS No. 142).

To obtain a complete understanding of our financial performance, operating
income, operating margin and adjusted net income should be examined in connection with net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the financial statements and notes thereto in this Report on Form 10-K. Since the items included
or excluded from operating income, operating margin and adjusted net income are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance under GAAP, these measures should not be considered to be alternatives to net income as a
measure of our operating performance or profitability. Because operating income, operating margin and adjusted net income are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, operating income,
operating margin and adjusted net income as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating our financial performance.



Below is a schedule of Supplemental Consolidated Income Statement Information which shows the calculation
of operating income, operating margin and adjusted net income (as used in the discussions below) for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:

Schedule of Supplemental Consolidated Income Statement Information

(dollar amounts in thousands)



We adopted SFAS No. 145 “Rescission of FASB Statement Nos. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 13 and Technical Corrections”, effective January 1, 2003, and reclassified to interest expense, our previously reported extraordinary items (during 2001) related to early extinguishment of debt.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the Year Ended December 31,
2002:

Net revenues increased 12% to $3.64 billion in 2003 as compared to $3.26 billion in 2002. The $380 million increase during 2003, as compared to 2002, was attributable to:

(i)

a $228 million or 7% increase in net revenues generated at acute care hospitals (located in the U.S., Puerto Rico and France) and behavioral health care facilities owned during both
years (which we refer to as “same facility”);

(ii)

$91 million of revenues generated at acute care and behavioral health care facilities acquired or opened in the U.S. and France at various times subsequent to January 1, 2002
(excludes revenues generated at these facilities one year after acquisition), and;

(iii)

$61 million of other increases in net revenues consisting primarily of $29 million from reclassifying certain supply costs incurred by our French hospitals and a $20 million
increase resulting from favorable exchange rate changes. Beginning January 1, 2003, we began recording as revenues and supplies expense, the cost of certain medical devices which are billed to patients of our French hospitals. Previously, these
amounts were recorded net in our consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2002, these amounts were approximately $15 million. The change in accounting presentation had no impact on previously reported operating income or
net income.

Operating income increased
$62 million or 12% to $578 million during 2003 as compared to $516 million during 2002. Our overall operating margins increased to 15.9% during 2003 as compared to 15.8% during 2002. The slight increase in the overall operating margin during 2003,
as compared to 2002, resulted primarily from a decrease in other operating expenses during 2003, as compared to 2002. This decrease was caused primarily by lower pharmacy costs resulting from a new outsourcing agreement, that commenced during the
third quarter of 2002, covering the pharmacy services for our acute care facilities located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico and decreased purchased services for contract staff and other various services at our behavioral health services facilities.
Partially offsetting these savings was an increase in supplies expense at our French hospitals and higher insurance costs.

Adjusted net income (as calculated above) increased 11% to $194 million during 2003 as compared to $174 million in 2002. The $20 million increase during
2003, as compared to 2002, was attributable to:

(i)

a favorable increase, on a same facility basis, of approximately $33 million, after-tax and after-minority interest expense, in operating income from our acute care and behavioral
health care facilities located in the U.S., Puerto Rico and France due primarily to the factors and trends described below in Acute Care Hospital Services and Behavioral Health Services;

(ii)

a favorable increase of approximately $8 million, after-tax and after-minority interest expense, in operating income from acute care and behavioral health care facilities
acquired/opened in France and the U.S. during 2003;

(iii)

a combined unfavorable after-tax increase of approximately $14 million in depreciation and amortization, lease rental and interest expense, and;

(iv)

$7 million of other unfavorable combined net decreases to adjusted net income.

The $14 million combined after-tax increases in depreciation, amortization, lease rental and interest expense during 2003, as compared to 2002, were
due primarily to the opening of the newly constructed George Washington University Hospital during the third quarter of 2002, the acquisition during the first quarter of 2003



of a behavioral health facility located in Anchorage, Alaska, the acquisition during 2003 of three hospitals located in France, and the opening of a newly
constructed acute care facility located in Las Vegas, Nevada during the fourth quarter of 2003.

Net income increased $24 million to $199 million during 2003 as compared to $175 million during 2002. The increase in net income resulted from: (i) the
$20 million after-tax increases in adjusted net income, as discussed above; (ii) a $9 million increase (net of minority interest expense and taxes) resulting from gains on sales of assets and businesses recorded during 2003; (iii) a $4 million
after-tax increase resulting from recovery of provision for judgment/closure costs ($5 million after-tax recovery of provision for judgment recorded during 2003 vs. $1 million after-tax recovery of provision for closure costs recorded during 2002),
and; (iv) partially offset by $9 million after-tax provision for asset impairment recorded during 2003.

On March 1, 2004, we announced that our earnings per diluted share for the three-month period ending March 31, 2004 could be as much as 25% lower than the
$.84 per diluted share recorded during the same quarter in 2003. This expected earnings decline is primarily attributable to: (i) on a same facility basis, our acute care hospitals have continued, in the first two months of 2004, to experience a
decline in inpatient admissions; (ii) during this period certain of our acute care facilities have been impacted by a negative shift in payor mix, a decline in intensity and an increase in length of stay; and (iii) the rising level of uninsured and
self-pay patients continues to unfavorably impact our provision for doubtful accounts. We are vigorously addressing each of these areas.

Year Ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2001:

Net revenues increased 15% to $3.26 billion in 2002 as compared to $2.84 billion in 2001. The $420 million increase during
2002, as compared to 2001, was attributable to:

(i)

a $255 million or 9% increase in net revenues, on a same facility basis, generated at acute care hospitals (located in the U.S., Puerto Rico and France) and behavioral health care
facilities;

(ii)

$159 million of revenues generated at acute care and behavioral health care facilities acquired in the U.S. and France purchased at various times subsequent to January 1, 2001
(excludes revenues generated at these facilities one year after acquisition), and;

(iii)

$6 million of other combined increases to net revenues.

Operating income increased $74 million or 17% to $516 million in 2002 as compared to $442 million in 2001. Our overall operating margins increased to
15.8% during 2002 as compared to 15.6% during 2001. During 2002, our other operating expenses increased to 24.2% of net revenues, as compared to 23.5% during 2001, due primarily to a significant increase in professional and general liability
insurance caused by unfavorable pricing and availability trends of commercial insurance. Salaries, wages and benefits increased to 39.9% of net revenues during 2002, as compared to 39.5% in 2001, due primarily to increased labor rates particularly
in the skilled nursing area. Offsetting these unfavorable factors impacting our overall operating margin was a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts which decreased to 7.1% of net revenues during 2002 as compared to 8.5% during 2001. This
improvement was primarily attributable to more aggressive efforts to properly categorize charges related to charity care, improved billing and collection procedures and an increase in collection of amounts previously reserved.

Adjusted net income increased 19% to $174 million during 2002 as compared to
$146 million in 2001. The $28 million increase during 2002, as compared to 2001, was attributable to:

(i)

a favorable increase, on a same facility basis, of approximately $30 million, after-tax and after-minority interest expense, in operating income from acute care and behavioral
health care facilities located in the U.S., Puerto Rico and France, due to the factors described below in Acute Care Services and Behavioral Health Services;



(ii)

a favorable increase of approximately $10 million, after-tax and after-minority interest expense, in operating income from acute care and behavioral health care facilities acquired
in the U.S., Puerto Rico and France during 2001 and 2002 (excludes operating income, after-tax, generated at these facilities one year after acquisition);

(iii)

a combined unfavorable after-tax increase of approximately $16 million in depreciation and amortization (excluding the $15.6 million of after-tax goodwill amortization expense
recorded during 2001), lease rental and interest expense, and;

(iv)

$4 million of other favorable combined net increases to adjusted net income.

The $16 million combined after-tax increases in depreciation, amortization, lease rental and interest expense during 2002, as compared to 2001, were
due primarily to the capital costs related to acquisitions, capital additions and the opening of the newly constructed George Washington University Hospital during the third quarter of 2002.

Net income increased $76 million to $175 million during 2002 as compared to
$100 million during 2001. The increase in net income resulted from: (i) the $28 million after-tax increases in adjusted net income, as discussed above; (ii) an after-tax increase of $25 million due to provision for insurance settlements recorded
during 2001; (iii) an after-tax increase of $16 million due to goodwill amortization expense recorded during 2001 (we ceased amortizing goodwill effective January 1, 2002); (iv) an after-tax increase of $5 million resulting from losses on derivative
transactions recorded during 2001, and; (v) $2 million of other after-tax increases.

Acute Care Hospital Services

Year Ended December 31, 2003
as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2002:

On a
same facility basis at our acute care hospitals located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico (which includes all facilities except Spring Valley Hospital which opened during the third quarter of 2003), net revenues increased 8% during 2003 as compared to
2002. Admissions at these facilities decreased 0.5% during 2003, as compared to the prior year, while patient days increased 0.4%. The average length of stay at these facilities increased slightly to 4.69 days during 2003 as compared to 4.65 days
during 2002. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 69.1% during 2003, as compared to 70.7% during 2002. Admissions and patient days during 2003 were unfavorably impacted by the conversion of a 160-bed
general acute care hospital located in Puerto Rico to a pediatric and surgical specialty hospital on April 1, 2003. Excluding this facility’s unfavorable impact on our same facility acute care hospital admissions and patient days, admissions
increased 0.3% and patient days increased 1.6% during 2003, as compared to 2002.

Our same facility net revenues were favorably impacted by an increase in prices charged to private payors including health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations. On a same facility basis, net
revenue per adjusted admission (adjusted for outpatient activity) at our acute care facilities located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico increased 7.3% during 2003, as compared to 2002, and net revenue per adjusted patient day at these facilities
increased 6.6% during 2003, as compared to 2002.

During 2003
and 2002, 42% and 43%, respectively, of the net patient revenues at our acute care facilities located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico were derived from Medicare and Medicaid (excludes revenues generated from managed Medicare and Medicaid programs).
During 2003 and 2002, 39% and 37%, respectively, of the net patient revenues at our acute care facilities were derived from managed care companies which includes health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs. We expect
that the percentage of our revenue from managed care business will continue to increase in the future. Generally, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers.

Upon meeting certain conditions, and serving a disproportionately high share
of Texas’ and South Carolina’s low income patients, five of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina



became eligible and received additional reimbursement from each state’s disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) fund. In order to receive DSH
funds, the facility must qualify to receive such payments. To qualify for DSH funds in Texas, the facility must have either a disproportionate total number of inpatient days for Medicaid patients, a disproportionate percentage of all inpatient days
that are for Medicaid patients, or a disproportionate percentage of all inpatient days that are for low-income patients. Included in our financial results was an aggregate of $27.8 million in 2003 and $33.0 million in 2002 related to DSH programs.
The Texas DSH program has been renewed for the 2004 fiscal year (covering the period of September 1, 2003 through August 31, 2004) and we expect the Texas DSH reimbursements to closely approximate amounts received during the state’s 2003 fiscal
year. However, South Carolina’s DSH program has not yet been renewed for the 2004 fiscal year (covering the period of July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2004) and we can not predict if it will be renewed for the state’s 2004 fiscal year, or any
future year. During South Carolina’s 2003 fiscal year, we received $5.5 million of DSH payments. Failure to renew the Texas program beyond its scheduled termination date (August 31, 2004), failure to renew the South Carolina program, failure of
our hospitals that currently receive DSH payments to qualify for future DSH funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements (including reductions related to the potential Texas Medicaid overpayments mentioned in “Regulation and
Other Factors”), could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

At our acute care hospitals located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, net revenues totaled $2.73 billion in 2003 and $2.52 billion in 2002. Operating expenses,
consisting of salaries, wages & benefits, other operating expenses, supplies expense and provision for doubtful accounts (excluding an allocation of corporate overhead), totaled $2.26 billion or 82.8% of net revenues during 2003 as compared to
$2.08 billion or 82.7% of net revenues during 2002. Operating income at our acute care hospitals was $470 million during 2003 and $436 million during 2002. Operating margins at these facilities were 17.2% during 2003 and 17.3% during 2002. On a same
facility basis, operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 82.9% during both 2003 and 2002 and operating margins at these acute care facilities were 17.1% in both years.

Favorably impacting the operating margins at our acute care hospitals located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico during 2003, as
compared to 2002, was a decrease in other operating expenses (to 23.3% of net revenues during 2003, as compared to 23.8% in 2002) resulting primarily from decreased pharmacy costs resulting from a new outsourcing agreement that commenced during the
third quarter of 2002. Also during 2003, supplies expense at our acute care facilities decreased to 14.0% of net revenues as compared to 14.5% during 2002 due primarily to the elimination of supply intensive, uneconomic service lines at several
hospitals

.

Unfavorably impacting the operating margins at our acute care hospitals was an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts which increased to 9.1% during 2003 as compared to 8.3% during 2002.

Many of our acute care facilities experienced decreased inpatient admissions
during 2003 as compared to the prior year, a trend which has continued into early 2004. In addition, our acute care facilities continue to experience an increase in the level of uninsured and self-pay patients, which unfavorably impacts the
collectibility of our patient accounts and results of operations. We expect these unfavorable trends to continue to pressure future results of operations until there is a notable strengthening of the labor markets in those regions in which our
hospitals operate.

Year Ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the Year
Ended December 31, 2001:

On a same facility basis, net
revenues at our acute care hospitals located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico increased 10% during 2002 as compared to 2001. Admissions at these facilities increased 6.9% during 2002, as compared to the prior year, while patient days increased 5.5%. The
average length of stay remained unchanged at 4.7 days during the 2002 and 2001. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, increased to 71.1% during 2002, as compared to 66.5% during 2001.



On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at our acute care facilities located in the
U.S. and Puerto Rico increased 3.6% during 2002, as compared to 2001, and net revenue per adjusted patient day at these facilities increased 4.6% during 2002, as compared to 2001. During each year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, 43% of the net
patient revenues at our acute care facilities located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico were derived from Medicare and Medicaid (excludes revenues generated from managed Medicare and Medicaid programs). During 2002 and 2001, 37% and 36%, respectively, of
the net patient revenues at our acute care facilities were derived from managed care companies which includes health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs. Included in our financial results was an aggregate of $33.0
million in 2002 and $32.6 million in 2001 related to the Texas and South Carolina DSH programs, as discussed above.

At our acute care hospitals located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, net revenues totaled $2.52 billion in 2002 and $2.18 billion in 2001. Operating expenses,
consisting of salaries, wages & benefits, other operating expenses, supplies expense and provision for doubtful accounts, totaled $2.08 billion or 82.7% of net revenues during 2002 as compared to $1.79 billion or 82.2% of net revenues during
2001. Operating income at our acute care hospitals was $436 million during 2002 and $389 million during 2001. Operating margins at these facilities were 17.3% during 2002 and 17.8% during 2001. On a same facility basis, operating expenses as a
percentage of net revenues were 82.5% during 2002 and 82.3% during 2001. Operating margins at these acute care facilities were 17.5% in 2002 and 17.7% in 2001.

Unfavorably impacting the operating margins at our acute care facilities during 2002, as compared to 2001, was an increase in other operating expenses
which increased to 23.8% of net revenues in 2002, as compared to 22.5% in 2001, and an increase in salaries, wages and benefits which increased to 36.1% of net revenues in 2002 as compared to 35.5% in 2001. The increase in other operating expenses
was due primarily to a significant increase in professional and general liability insurance expense caused by unfavorable pricing and availability trends of commercial insurance. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits was due primarily to
increased labor rates particularly in the area of skilled nursing. Favorably impacting the operating margins at our acute care hospitals located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico during 2002, as compared to 2001, was a reduction in the provision for
doubtful accounts which, as a percentage of net revenues, decreased to 8.3% in 2002 as compared to 9.7% in 2001. This improvement was primarily attributable to more aggressive efforts to properly categorize charges related to charity care, improved
billing and collection procedures and an increase in collection of amounts previously reserved.

Behavioral Health Care Services

Year Ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2002:

On a same facility basis, net revenues at our behavioral health care facilities increased 5% during 2003, as compared to 2002. Admissions at these facilities increased 2.9% during 2003, as compared to the prior year,
while patient days increased 2.7% and the average length of stay remained unchanged at 11.9 days during both years. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at our behavioral health care facilities, increased to 77.7% during 2003 as
compared to 76.4% during 2002.

Net revenues were favorably
impacted by an increase in prices charged to private payors including health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations. On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission and net revenue per adjusted patient day at our
behavioral health care facilities each increased 3.3% during 2003, as compared to 2002.

During 2003 and 2002, 36% and 35%, respectively, of the net patient revenues at our behavioral health care facilities were derived from Medicare and Medicaid (excludes revenues generated from managed Medicare and
Medicaid programs). During 2003 and 2002, 51% and 48%, respectively, of the net patient revenues at our behavioral health care were derived from managed care companies which includes health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid
programs. We expect that the percentage of our revenue from managed care business will continue to increase in the future. Generally, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers.



At our behavioral health care facilities, net revenues totaled $612 million in 2003 and $566 million in
2002. Operating expenses, consisting of salaries, wages & benefits, other operating expenses, supplies expense and provision for doubtful accounts (excluding an allocation of corporate overhead), totaled $468 million or 76.5% of net revenues
during 2003 as compared to $451 million or 79.7% of net revenues during 2002. Operating income at our behavioral health care facilities was $144 million during 2003 and $115 million during 2002. Operating margins at these facilities were 23.5%
during 2003 and 20.3% during 2002. On a same facility basis, operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 76.8% during 2003 and 79.7% during 2002 and operating margins at these acute care facilities were 23.2% during 2003 and 20.3% during
2002.

Favorably impacting the operating margins at our
behavioral health care facilities during 2003, as compared to 2002, was a decrease in other operating expenses (to 21.1% of net revenues during 2003 as compared to 23.0% in 2002) resulting primarily from decreased purchased services for contract
staff and other various services. Also favorably impacting the operating margin during 2003 was a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts (to 2.2% of net revenues during 2003 as compared to 3.6% in 2002) resulting primarily from the reversal
of $4 million of previously established provisions for doubtful accounts which were reversed as a result of Magellan Health Services’ emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January, 2004.

Year Ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2001:

On a same facility basis, net revenues at our behavioral
health care facilities increased 4% during 2002 as compared to 2001. Admissions at these facilities increased 6.4% during 2002 as compared to the prior year while patient days increased 5.2%. The average length of stay decreased to 11.9 days in 2002
as compared to 12.1 days in 2001. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at our behavioral health care facilities, increased to 76.4% during 2002 as compared to 72.8% during 2001.

On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission decreased 0.4%
and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 1.1% during 2002 as compared to 2001.

During 2002 and 2001, 35% and 38%, respectively, of the net patient revenues at our behavioral health care facilities were derived from Medicare and Medicaid (excludes revenues generated from managed Medicare and
Medicaid programs). During 2002 and 2001, 48% and 39%, respectively, of the net patient revenues at our behavioral health care facilities were derived from managed care companies which includes health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare
and Medicaid programs.

At our behavioral health care
facilities, net revenues totaled $566 million in 2002 and $538 million in 2001. Operating expenses, consisting of salaries, wages & benefits, other operating expenses, supplies expense and provision for doubtful accounts (excluding an allocation
of corporate overhead), totaled $451 million or 79.7% of net revenues during 2002 as compared to $435 million or 81.0% of net revenues during 2001. Operating income at our behavioral health care facilities was $115 million during 2002 and $103
million during 2001. Operating margins at these facilities were 20.3% during 2002 and 19.0% during 2001. On a same facility basis, operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 79.7% during 2002 and 81.0% during 2001 and operating margins
at these facilities were 20.3% during 2002 and 19.0% during 2001.

International and Other Operating Results

Combined net revenues from the other operating entities including outpatient surgery centers, radiation centers and an 80% ownership interest in an operating company that owns twelve hospitals in France, increased to $291 million during
2003 as compared to $161 million during 2002 and $113 million in 2001. The combined net revenue increases of $130 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, and $48 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, were primarily attributable to the acquisition of
additional hospitals by our French subsidiary and the additional month of financial results recorded for our French subsidiary during 2003, as discussed below. Combined operating margins from the other operating entities were 15.7% in 2003, 21.3% in
2002 and 20.2% in



2001. Contributing to the operating margin decreases during 2003, as compared to 2002 and 2001, were lower operating margins at the facilities located in
France acquired during 2003 and financial statement reclassifications related to the French operations recorded during 2003. These reclassifications, which had no effect on net income, increased net revenues and supplies expense by approximately $29
million during 2003.

On a same facility basis at our hospitals
located in France (excluding the effects of changes in the foreign currency exchange rate and additional month of results recorded during 2003), net revenues increased 8% during 2003 as compared to 2002. Admissions at these facilities decreased 2.0%
during 2003, as compared to the prior year, while patient days decreased 0.7%. The average length of stay at these facilities increased slightly to 5.1 days during 2003 as compared to 5.0 days during 2002. The occupancy rate, based on the average
available beds at these facilities, was 78.4% during 2003, as compared to 80.7% during 2002. The large majority of the revenues generated by our hospitals located in France are paid by the government based on predetermined rates established in May
of each year and consist of a per diem payment and per procedure rate plus reimbursement for certain supplies.

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2003, our French subsidiary was included on the basis of the year ended November 30

th

. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded an additional month of financial results to convert this subsidiary to a December 31

st

year-end. The additional month of financial results increased net revenues by approximately $18 million, or 0.5% of our
consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effect on our consolidated net income resulting from this adjustment was approximately $500,000 during the year ended December 31, 2003.

Included in our results for the year ended December 31, 2003 were the
following items: (i) the reversal of an accrued liability amounting to $8.9 million pre-tax ($5.6 million after-tax), including $1.9 million of accrued interest, resulting from a favorable Texas Supreme Court decision which reversed an unfavorable
2000 jury verdict and 2001 appellate court decision; (ii) a combined pre-tax net gain of $14.6 million ($8.7 million after-tax and after minority interest expense) realized on the disposition of an investment in a health-care related company and
sales of radiation therapy centers, medical office buildings and an outpatient surgery center, and; (iii) a pre-tax $13.7 million provision for asset impairment ($8.7 million after-tax) resulting from the write-down of the carrying value of a
160-bed acute care pediatric hospital located in Puerto Rico to its estimated fair value.

In April of 2003, we converted the operations of this 160-bed facility located in Puerto Rico from general acute care services to pediatric services in an effort to increase the long-term profitability of the
facility. Based on the nine month operating performance (after its conversion to a pediatric facility) and in conjunction with the development of our operating plan and 2004 budget, management assessed the current competitive position and estimated
future cash flows expected from this facility. Based upon our assessment, we determined that a permanent impairment had occurred and as a result, during the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a $13.7 million pre-tax charge to write-down the
carrying value of certain tangible assets at this facility. In measuring the provision for impairment loss, we estimated fair value by discounting expected future cash flows from this facility using an appropriate discount rate.

Included in our results during the year ended December 31, 2002 was a $2.2
million pre-tax recovery of provision for closure cost ($1.4 million after-tax) resulting from the sale of the real estate of a women’s hospital that was written down to its estimated fair value during 2000.

During 2001, the we recorded the following charges: (i) a $40.0 million
pre-tax charge ($25.2 million after-tax) to reserve for malpractice expenses that may result from our third party malpractice insurance company that was placed in liquidation in February, 2002; (ii) a $7.4 million pre-tax loss ($4.6 million
after-tax) on derivative transactions resulting from the early termination of interest rate swaps, and; (iii) a $1.6 million pre-tax charge ($1.0 million after-tax) to interest expense resulting from the early redemption of the $135 million 8.75%
notes issued in 1995.



We recorded minority interest expense in the earnings of consolidated entities amounting to $23.3 million
in 2003, $19.7 million in 2002 and $17.5 million in 2001. The minority interest expense includes the minority ownerships’ share of the net income of five acute care facilities located in the U.S., four of which are located in Las Vegas, Nevada
and one located in Washington, D.C, and twelve acute care facilities located in France.

Depreciation and amortization expense was $144.5 million in 2003, $124.8 million in 2002 and $127.5 million in 2001. The increase during 2003, as compared to 2002, resulted primarily from: (i) the depreciation expense
related to the newly constructed George Washington University Hospital which opened during the third quarter of 2002; (ii) the acquisition during the first quarter of 2003 of a 108-bed behavioral health system in Anchorage, Alaska and two hospitals
located in France that were purchased by an operating company which is 80% owned by us (the operations of a third facility in France were acquired during the third quarter of 2003, however, the property is currently being leased from a third-party),
and; (iii) the depreciation expense on various property and equipment additions including the opening of a newly constructed 176-bed acute care facility located in Las Vegas, Nevada (opened during the fourth quarter of 2003). Effective January 1,
2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” and accordingly, ceased amortizing goodwill as of that date. During 2001, we recorded $24.7 million of pre-tax goodwill amortization expense ($15.6
million after-tax). Substantially offsetting the decrease during 2002, as compared to 2001, caused by the adoption of SFAS No. 142 was an increase in depreciation expense during 2002 attributable to additions to property and equipment, including
acquisitions, as well as depreciation expense on the 371-bed George Washington University Hospital which opened during the third quarter of 2002.

The effective tax rate was 37.3% in 2003, 36.7% in 2002 and 36.2% in 2001. The increases during 2003, as compared to the prior years, was due primarily to
the prior years including a tax credit for which, beginning in 2003, we were no longer eligible.

Professional and General Liability Claims

Due to unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional and general liability insurance markets, our subsidiaries have assumed a greater portion of the hospital professional and general liability risk
as the cost of commercial professional and general liability insurance coverage has risen significantly. As a result, effective January 1, 2002, most of our subsidiaries were self-insured for malpractice exposure up to $25 million per occurrence. We
purchased an umbrella excess policy for our subsidiaries through a commercial insurance carrier for coverage in excess of $25 million per occurrence with a $75 million aggregate limitation.

For the period from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2001, most of our
subsidiaries were covered under commercial insurance policies with PHICO, a Pennsylvania based insurance company that was placed into liquidation during the first quarter of 2002. As a result of PHICO’s liquidation, we recorded a $40 million
pre-tax charge during 2001 to reserve for PHICO claims that could become our liability, however, we are entitled to receive reimbursement from state insurance guaranty funds, other commercial insurers and/or PHICO’s estate for a portion of
certain claims ultimately paid by us.

Our estimated liability
for professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement
amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional
and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.

As of December 31, 2003, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims, was $190.8 million ($147.7 million net of expected
recoveries), of which $35.0 million is included in other current liabilities. As of December 31, 2002, the total reserve for our professional and general liability claims was $168.2 million ($131.2 million net of expected recoveries), of which $12
million is included in other current liabilities. Included in other assets was $43.0 million as of December 31, 2003, and $37.0 million as of December 31, 2002, related to estimated expected recoveries from various state guaranty funds, insurance
companies and other sources in connection with PHICO related professional and general liability claims payments.



Given these insurance market conditions, there can be no assurance that a continuation of these
unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in claims asserted against us, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

Effects of Inflation and Seasonality

Seasonality

— Our business is typically seasonal, with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and
fourth quarters of the year. This seasonality occurs because, generally, more people become ill during the winter months, which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months.

Inflation

— Although inflation has not had a material
impact on our results of operations over the last three years, the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are rising supply costs which tend to escalate as vendors pass on the
rising costs through price increases. Our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide, which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries, wages and
benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate. In addition, due to unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional and general liability insurance markets, the cost of commercial professional and general liability insurance
coverage has risen significantly. As a result, our subsidiaries have assumed a greater portion of the hospital professional and general liability risk. Given these insurance market conditions, there can be no assurance that a continuation of these
unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in claims asserted against our subsidiaries, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

Although the we cannot predict our ability to continue to cover future cost increases, we believe that through adherence to
cost containment policies, labor management and reasonable price increases, the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable. However, our ability to pass on these increased costs associated with providing healthcare to
Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. In addition, as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures
and a continuing industry wide shift of patients into managed care plans, our ability to maintain margins through price increases to non-Medicare patients is limited.

Liquidity

Year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to December 31, 2002:

Net cash provided by operating activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $377 million during 2003 as compared to $331 million during 2002. The 14% or $46 million increase was
primarily attributable to:

•

a favorable change of $34 million due to an increase in net income plus or minus the adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities (depreciation
and amortization, accretion of discount on convertible debentures, losses on foreign exchange and debt extinguishment, gains on sales of assets and businesses and recovery of provision for judgment);

•

a favorable change of $28 million in accrued and deferred income taxes due primarily to the timing of income tax payments and the favorable effect of “bonus” depreciation
and tax benefits on increased capital expenditures;

•

a favorable change of $24 million in accounts receivable (partially due to the prior year containing unfavorable changes due to the timing of Medicare settlements and the increased
patient volume and revenue at the George Washington University Hospital which opened during the third quarter of 2002);

•

an unfavorable change of $44 million in other working capital accounts due primarily to timing of accrued compensation payments and accounts payable disbursements;

•

$4 million of other net favorable changes in working capital.



Net cash used in investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased to $480 million during 2003 as compared to $202 million during 2002. During
2003, we spent $224 million to finance capital expenditures and an additional $281 million on the acquisition of newly acquired facilities, including the following:

2003 Capital Expenditures

•

Completion of the newly constructed Spring Valley Hospital;

•

Construction costs related to the new Lakewood Ranch Hospital, a 120-bed acute care facility located in Manatee County, Florida that is scheduled to open during the third quarter of
2004;

•

Completion of a 90-bed addition to our Northwest Texas Hospital;

•

Capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities.

2003 Acquisitions

•

The North Star Hospital and related treatment centers;

•

Three acute care facilities located in France;

•

Three acute care facilities in California, Corona Regional Medical Center, French Medical Center and Arroyo Grande Community Hospital, all of which are ownership effective as of
January 1, 2004;

•

The acquisition of a 90% controlling ownership interest in Pendleton Methodist Hospital in Louisiana, which is ownership effective January 1, 2004, and;

•

The acquisition of a behavioral health facility located in Alaska and an outpatient surgery center located in Oklahoma.

Capital expenditures committed to by us, including expenditures for capital
equipment, renovations and new projects at existing hospitals and completion of major construction projects in progress at December 31, 2003 are expected to total approximately $225 million to $250 million. We believe that our capital expenditure
program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated funds and borrowed funds. Additional borrowed funds may be obtained either through
refinancing the existing revolving credit agreement and/or the commercial paper facility and/or the issuance of equity or long-term debt.

During 2003, we received total cash proceeds of $25 million for the sale of five radiation therapy centers, two medical office buildings (which were sold
to limited liability companies that are majority owned by Universal Health Realty Income Trust), an outpatient surgery center and the disposition of our investment in a healthcare related company. These transactions resulted in a combined pre-tax
gain of $15 million ($9 million after minority interest expense and income taxes) which is included in our 2003 financial statements.

During 2002, we spent $3 million to acquire a majority interest in an outpatient surgery center located in Puerto Rico and $207 million to finance capital
expenditures, including the following:

•

Construction costs related to the completion of the new George Washington University Hospital located in Washington, D.C. which opened in August, 2002;

•

Construction costs related to a 56-bed patient tower at Auburn Regional Medical Center located in Auburn, Washington which opened in January, 2003;

•

Construction costs related to the first phase of the newly constructed Spring Valley Hospital located in Las Vegas, Nevada;

•

Capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities.

During 2002, we received total cash proceeds of $8 million resulting from the sale of real estate related to a women’s
hospital and radiation oncology center both of which were closed in a prior year and written down to



their estimated net realizable values. The sale of the real property of the women’s hospital resulted in a $2 million recovery of closure costs and the
net gain on the sale of the assets of the radiation therapy center did not have a material impact on the 2002 results of operations.

Net cash provided by/used in financing activities

During 2003, net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $121 million as compared to $135 million of net cash used in financing activities
during 2002. The $121 million of net cash provided by financing activities during 2003 consisted of the following: (i) $175 million of additional borrowings, borrowed primarily under our $400 million revolving credit agreement
(“Revolver”), to finance the acquisitions mentioned above; (ii) $54 million spent during 2003 to repurchase 1.4 million shares of our Class B Common Stock on the open market; (iii) $5 million spent during the fourth quarter of 2003 to pay
an $.08 per share quarterly cash dividend, and; (iv) $5 million of other net cash provided by financing activities.

The $135 million of net cash used in financing activities during 2002 consisted of the following: (i) $67 million of net repayments of debt ($106 million
of repayments, the majority of which reduced outstanding borrowings under our Revolver, less $39 million of additional borrowings consisting primarily of new borrowings pursuant to the terms of our France subsidiary’s debt facility); (ii) $77
million spent during 2002 to repurchase 1.7 million shares of our Class B Common Stock, and; (iii) partially offset by $9 million of other net cash provided by financing activities.

Year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to December 31, 2001:

Net cash provided by operating activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $331 million during 2002 as compared to $298 million during 2001. The 11% or $33 million increase during
2002 was primarily attributable to:

•

a favorable change of $23 million due to an increase in net income plus or minus the adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities (depreciation
and amortization, accretion of discount on convertible debentures, losses on foreign exchange and debt extinguishment and provision for insurance settlements);

•

an unfavorable change of $36 million in accounts receivable, partially due to the timing of Medicare settlements and the increased patient volume and revenue at the new George
Washington University Hospital which opened during the third quarter of 2002;

•

a $19 million favorable change in accrued insurance expense net of payments made in settlement of self-insurance claims and commercial premiums paid caused primarily by our
subsidiaries assuming a greater portion of the professional and general liability risk beginning in January, 2002;

•

a $17 million favorable change due to timing of income tax payments, and;

$135 million notes), and; (ii) $12 million of other net cash used in financing activities.

Capital Resources

Credit Facilities
and Outstanding Debt Securities

We have a $400 million
unsecured non-amortizing revolving credit agreement (“Revolver”), which expires on December 13, 2006. The agreement includes a $50 million sublimit for letters of credit of which $11.6 million was available at December 31, 2003. The
interest rate on borrowings is determined at our option at the prime rate, certificate of deposit rate plus .925% to 1.275%, Euro-dollar plus .80% to 1.150% or a money market rate. A facility fee ranging from .20% to .35% is required on the total
commitment. The margins over the certificate of deposit, the Euro-dollar rates and the facility fee are based upon the our leverage ratio. At December 31, 2003, the applicable margins over the certificate of deposit and the Euro-dollar rate were
1.125% and 1.00%, respectively, and the commitment fee was .25%. There are no compensating balance requirements. At December 31, 2003, we had $157 million of unused borrowing capacity available under the Revolver.

We also have a $100 million commercial paper credit facility which is fully
collateralized by a portion of our acute care patient acounts receivable.

A commitment fee of .40% is required on the used portion and .20% on the unused portion of the commitment. This annually renewable program, which began in November
1993, is scheduled to expire or be renewed in October of each year. Outstanding amounts of commercial paper which, can be refinanced through available borrowings under our Revolver, are classified as long-term. As of December 31, 2003, we had no
unused borrowing capacity under the terms of the commercial paper facility.



During 2003, our 80% owned France subsidiary entered into a senior credit agreement denominated in Euros
which provides for a total commitment of 90 million Euros. The loan, which is non-recourse to us, amortizes to zero over the life of the agreement and matures on December 4, 2009. Interest on the loan is at the option of our majority-owned
subsidiary and can be based on the one, two, three and six month EURIBOR plus a spread of 2.00% to 2.50%. The spread in effect at December 31, 2003 was 2.25%. As of December 31, 2003, the interest rate was 4.43%, including the spread of 2.25%, and
the effective interest rate including the effects of the designated interest rate swaps and the spread of 2.25% was 6.28%. As of December 31, 2003, there was 41 million Euros ($52 million) of debt outstanding, and 48 million Euros ($61 million) of
unused borrowing capacity, pursuant to the terms of this agreement.

During 2001, we issued $200 million of Senior Notes which have a 6.75% coupon rate and which mature on November 15, 2011. (“Notes”). The interest on the Notes is paid semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year.
The notes can be redeemed in whole at any time and in part from time to time.

Additionally, we issued discounted Convertible Debentures in 2000 which are due in 2020 (“Debentures”). The aggregate issue price of the Debentures was $250 million or $587 million aggregate principal amount
at maturity. The Debentures were issued at a price of $425.90 per $1,000 principal amount of Debenture. The Debentures’ yield to maturity is 5% per annum, .426% of which is cash interest. The interest on the bonds is paid semiannually in
arrears on June 23 and December 23 of each year. The Debentures are convertible at the option of the holders into 11.2048 shares of our common stock per $1,000 of Debentures, however, we have the right to redeem the Debenture any time on or after
June 23, 2006 at a price equal to the issue price of the Debentures plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest to the date of redemption.

Our total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 45% at December 31, 2003 and 43% at December 31, 2002. Covenants relating to long-term
debt require maintenance of a minimum net worth, specified debt to total capital and fixed charge coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all required covenants as of December 31, 2003.

Covenants relating to long-term debt require maintenance of a minimum net
worth, specified debt to total capital and fixed charge coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all required covenants as of December 31, 2003.

The fair value of our long-term debt at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $1.00 billion and $791.1 million, respectively.

We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions with
internally generated funds and borrowed funds. Additional borrowed funds may be obtained either through refinancing the existing revolving credit agreement and/or the commercial paper facility and/or the issuance of equity or long-term debt.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2003, we were party to certain off balance sheet
arrangements consisting of operating leases and standby letters of credit and surety bonds. Our outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds, as of December 31, 2003, totaled $40 million consisting of: (i) $34 million related to our self-insurance
programs, and; (ii) $6 million consisting primarily of collateral for outstanding bonds of an unaffiliated third party and public utility.

Obligations under operating leases for real property, real property master leases and equipment amount to $122.8 million as of December 31, 2003, as
disclosed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. The real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near hospital property for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income. We sublease space in these buildings and any
amounts received from these subleases are offset against the expense. In addition, we lease six hospital facilities from Universal Health Realty Income Trust with terms expiring in 2004 through 2008. These leases contain up to five 5-year renewal
options.



The following represents the scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations as of December 31,
2003:

(a)

Includes capital lease obligations

(b)

Amount is presented net of discount on Convertible Debentures of $299,119.

(c)

Estimated cost of completion on the construction of a new 100-bed acute care facility in Eagle Pass, Texas.

(d)

Minimum obligation pursuant to a contract that expires in 2012, that provides for certain data processing services at our acute care and behavioral health facilities

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in domestic interest rates, a
portion of our debt is fixed rate accomplished by either borrowing on a long-term basis at fixed rates or by entering into interest rate swap transactions. Our interest rate swap agreements are contracts that require us to pay fixed and receive
floating interest rates or to pay floating and receive fixed interest rates over the life of the agreements. The floating-rates are based on LIBOR and the fixed-rate is determined at the time the swap agreement is consummated.

As of December 31, 2003, we had three U.S. dollar interest rate swaps. One
fixed rate swap with a notional principal amount of $125 million expires in August 2005. We pay a fixed rate of 6.76% and receives a floating rate equal to three month LIBOR. As of December 31, 2003, the effective floating rate of this interest rate
swap was 1.18%. We are also a party to two floating rate swaps having a notional principal amount of $60 million in which we receive a fixed rate of 6.75% and pay a floating rate equal to 6 month LIBOR plus a spread. The initial term of these swaps
was ten years and they are both scheduled to expire on November 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2003, the average floating rate of the $60 million of interest rate swaps was 2.56%.

As of December 31, 2003, a majority-owned subsidiary of ours had two interest rate swaps denominated in Euros. The total
notional amount of these two interest rate swaps is 35.1 million Euros ($44.2 million based on the end of period currency exchange rate). The notional amount decreases to 27.5 million Euros ($34.6 million) on December 30, 2004, and the swaps mature
on June 30, 2005. Our subsidiary pays an average fixed rate of 4.35% and receives six month EURIBOR. The effective floating rate for these swaps as of December 31, 2003 was 2.17%.

The interest rate swap agreements do not constitute positions independent of the underlying exposures. We do not hold or
issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage features. We are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its financial instruments. The counterparties
are creditworthy financial institutions, rated AA or better by Moody’s Investor Services and we anticipate that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, we received weighted average rates of 3.1%, 3.5% and 5.9%, respectively, and paid a weighted average rate on its domestic interest rate swap agreements of 5.5% in 2003, 5.7% in 2002 and 6.9% in 2001.

The table below presents information about our derivative financial
instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including long-term debt and interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2003. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related
weighted-average



interest rates by contractual maturity dates. For interest rate swap agreements, the table presents notional amounts by maturity date and weighted average
interest rates based on rates in effect at December 31, 2003. The fair values of long-term debt and interest rate swaps were determined based on market prices quoted at December 31, 2003, for the same or similar debt issues.

Maturity Date, Fiscal Year Ending December 31

(Dollars in thousands)

(a)

The fair value of our 5% Convertible Debentures (“Debentures”) at December 31, 2003 is $387 million, however, we have the right to redeem the Debentures any time on or
after June 23, 2006 at a price equal to the issue price of the Debentures plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest to the date of redemption. On June 23, 2006 the amount necessary to redeem all Debentures would be $319 million.
If the Debentures could be redeemed at the same basis at December 31, 2003 the redemption amount would be $288 million. The holders of the Debentures may convert the Debentures to our Class B stock at any time. If all Debentures were converted, the
result would be the issuance of 6.6 million shares of our Class B Common Stock.

ITEM 9.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

There were no disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosures during the last three fiscal years. On
June 18, 2002, we dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP as our independent public accountants and decided to engage KPMG LLP to serve as our independent public accountant for 2002. Our decision to change our independent accountants was approved by the Board
of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee. For more information with respect to this matter, see our current report on Form 8-K filed on June 18, 2002.

ITEM 9A.

Controls and Procedures.

As of December 31, 2003, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and
Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was performed. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective

AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Universal Health Services, Inc.:

We have audited the
2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements of Universal Health Services, Inc. (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries as listed in the companying index. In connection with our audits of the 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited the 2003 and 2002 financial statement schedules as listed in the accompanying index. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. The 2001 consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule of Universal Health Services,
Inc. and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule, before
the revisions as described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in their report dated February 13, 2002.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Universal Health Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related 2003 and 2002 financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of Universal Health Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and for the year
then ended, were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Note 1, the consolidated financial statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which was adopted as of January 1, 2002. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2001 in Note 1 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the
2001 consolidated financial statements of Universal Health Services, Inc. and subsidiaries other than with respect to such disclosures, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1)    BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our principal business is owning and operating, through
our subsidiaries acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers and ambulatory surgery and radiation oncology centers. We operate 48 acute care hospitals and 44 behavioral health centers located in 22 states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico and France.
As part of our ambulatory treatment centers division, we manage and own outright or in partnership with physicians, 16 surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 9 states and Puerto Rico. Included in the facilities mentioned above were 3
acute care hospitals located in California and one acute care hospital located in Louisiana which were ownership effective on January 1, 2004. We also acquired an additional acute care facility located in Louisiana effective February 1, 2004.

Services provided by our hospitals include general surgery,
internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services and behavioral health services. We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to its facilities,
including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.

Net revenues from our acute care hospitals (including the facilities located
in France) and ambulatory and radiation oncology centers accounted for 83%, 82% and 81% of consolidated net revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities accounted for 17%, 17% and 19%, of
consolidated net revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The more significant accounting policies follow:

A)  Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships controlled by us or our subsidiaries as the managing
general partner. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2003, we consolidated the accounts of our French subsidiary on the basis of the year ending November 30

th

. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded an additional month of operating results to convert this subsidiary to a
December 31

st

year-end.

B)

Revenue Recognition:

We record revenues and the related receivables for health care services at the
time the services are provided. We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates. Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs,
discounted charges, and per diem payments. We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients, third-party payors, and others for services rendered, including estimated retroactive adjustments under
reimbursement agreements with third-party payors. We accrued retroactive adjustments on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined.

Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 41%, 42% and 42% of our net
revenues during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 41%, 39% and 37% of our revenues during 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts
in the near term. The large majority of the revenues generated by the acute care hospitals owned by our France subsidiary are paid by the government based on predetermined rates established in May of each year and consist of a per diem payment and
per procedure rate plus reimbursement for certain supplies.

We
provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than established rates. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not
reported in net revenues or accounts receivable, net.



C)  Provision for Doubtful Accounts:

Collection of receivables
from third-party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient’s responsibility,
primarily co-payments and deductibles. We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience. We routinely review accounts receivable balances
in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectibility of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted. Significant changes in business office operations, payor
mix, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flow and results of operations. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, accounts receivable are recorded net of
allowance for doubtful accounts of $56.4 million and $59.1 million, respectively.

D)

Concentration of Revenues:

Our four majority-owned facilities operating in the Las Vegas market (including the newly constructed Spring Valley Hospital which opened
during the fourth quarter of 2003) contributed on a combined basis 15%, 15% and 16% of our consolidated net revenues during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Two facilities located in the McAllen/Edinburg, Texas market contributed, on a combined
basis, 10%, 11% and 11% of our consolidated net revenues during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

E)  Cash and Cash Equivalents:

We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months
or less to be cash equivalents. Interest expense in the consolidated statements of income is net of interest income of approximately $200,000 during 2003, $600,000 during 2002 and $1.9 million during 2001.

F)

Property and
Equipment:

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements are charged to the property accounts. Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the
respective asset are expensed as incurred. We remove the cost and the related accumulated depreciation from the accounts for assets sold or retired and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations.

We capitalize interest expense on major construction projects while in
process. We capitalized $3.6 million, $4.6 million and $3.0 million of interest related to major construction in projects in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements (twenty to forty years) and
equipment (three to fifteen years). Depreciation expense was $132.2 million, $113.7 million and $96.1 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

G)  Long-Lived Assets:

In accordance with SFAS No.144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets”, we review our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible
impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, we recognize an
impairment loss and write the long-lived asset down to its estimated fair value. We determine the fair values based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.

Based on the operating performance of our acute care pediatric hospital in Puerto Rico and in connection with the
development of our operating plan and 2004 budget for this facility, we assessed the facility’s current competitive position and estimates of future cash flows. Based on this assessment, we recorded a $13.7 million pre-tax charge in the fourth
quarter of 2003 to write-down the carrying value of certain long-lived assets at this facility to their estimated fair values.

H)  Goodwill:

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, we ceased
amortizing goodwill as of January 1, 2002. We review for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual



basis (September 1

st

) or
sooner if any indicators of impairment arise. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit. The results of our analysis performed as of September 1,
2003, did not indicate any impairment of goodwill. Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a
write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill.

The following
table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share on a pro-forma basis assuming that SFAS No. 142 was adopted on January 1, 2001:

Changes in the
carrying amount of goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2003 were as follows (in thousands):

(a)

Consists of the foreign currency translation adjustment on goodwill recorded in connection with our 80% ownership interest in an operating company that owns acute care facilities in
France.

I)  Other
Assets:

During 1994, we established an employee life insurance program covering approximately 2,100 employees. The cash surrender value of the policies ($14.9 million at December 31, 2003 and $15.8 million at December 31,
2002) was recorded net of related loans ($14.8 million at December 31, 2003 and $15.7 million at December 31, 2002) and is included in other assets.



Included in other assets are estimates of expected recoveries from various state guaranty funds, insurers
and other sources in connection with PHICO related professional and general liability claims payments amounting to $43.0 million and $37.0 million at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. Actual recoveries may vary from these
estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates. Other assets at December 31, 2003 also include $230 million of deposits on acquisitions, which were consummated on January 1, 2004.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, other intangible assets, net of accumulated
amortization, were not material.

J)  Self-Insured
Risks:

We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers’ compensation claims, based on estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred by
not reported. Estimated losses from asserted and incurred but not yet reported claims are accrued based on our estimates of the ultimate costs of the claims, which includes costs associated with litigating or settling claims, and the relationship of
past reported incidents to eventual claims payments. All relevant information, including our own historical experience, the nature and extent of existing asserted claims and reported incidents, and independent actuarial analyses of this information,
is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. We also consider amounts that may be recovered from excess insurance carriers, state guaranty funds and other sources in estimating our ultimate net liability for such risk.

In addition, we also maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for
healthcare and dental claims. The ultimate costs related to these programs includes expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.

Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed,
if necessary, at each reporting date. The amounts of the changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense and if payments of claims exceed our projected estimates, the insurance accruals could be materially
adversely affected.

K)

Income
Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts
in the financial statements. We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets and therefore no valuation allowances have been recorded.

We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws. We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities. Our
tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service and various state authorities through the year ended December 31, 1999. The Internal Revenue Service recently commenced a routine examination of the subsequent years. We believe that
adequate accruals have been provided for federal and state taxes.

L)

Other Noncurrent Liabilities:

Other noncurrent liabilities include the long-term portion of our professional and general liability, workers’ compensation reserves and pension
liability.

M)  Minority
Interest:

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the $159.6 million and $140.2 million, respectively, minority interest liability consists primarily of a 27.5% outside ownership interest in our four acute care facilities
located in Las Vegas, Nevada, a 20% outside ownership interest in our acute care facility located in Washington, DC and a 20% outside ownership interest in our operating company that owns twelve hospitals in France.

In connection with the four acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, the
outside owners have certain “put rights” that may require the respective limited liabilities companies to purchase the minority member’s interests upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below
established thresholds, (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member’s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds. In connection with the twelve
hospitals located in France, the minority owners have certain “put rights” that if exercised, would require us to purchase a stipulated percentage of their shares (up to 25% of the shares through December 31, 2003; up to 50% of the shares
through December 31, 2004 and up to 100% of the shares through March 31, 2009) at a multiple of the subsidiary’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined. We also have certain “call rights” that would
allow us to purchase all of the minority owners’ shares pursuant to this formula at any time through December 31, 2009.



N)  Comprehensive Income:

Comprehensive income or loss is
recorded in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income”. SFAS No.130 establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in financial statements. Comprehensive income (loss), is
comprised of net income, changes in unrealized gains or losses on derivative financial instruments, foreign currency translation adjustments and the minimum pension liability.

O) Accounting for Derivative Financial Investments and Hedging Activities:

We manage our ratio
of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate. To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements, in which we agree to
exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.

We account for our derivative and hedging activities using SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended
by SFAS No. 149, which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet. For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally
document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows,
or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) within shareholders’ equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.

We use interest rate swaps in our cash flow hedge transactions. The interest
rate swaps are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the
hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value
hedges under SFAS 133. Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item in the income statement.

For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge’s inception and on a regular basis
thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected
to be highly effective in the future.

P)  Foreign
Currency:

One of our subsidiaries operates in France, whose currency is denominated in Euros. Our French subsidiary translates its assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates in effect at the end
of the fiscal period. Any resulting gains or losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying balance sheet.

The revenue and expense accounts of the France subsidiary are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate that prevailed during the period.
Therefore, the U.S. dollar value of the French subsidiary’s operating results may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in exchange rates.

Q)  Stock-Based Compensation:

At December 31, 2003, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans,
which are more fully described in Note 5. We account for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No.25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related



Interpretations. No compensation cost is reflected in net income for most stock option grants, as all options granted under the plan had an original exercise
price equal to the market value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement
No.123,”Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to stock-based employee compensation. We recognize compensation cost related to restricted share awards over the respective vesting periods, using an accelerated method.

R)  Earnings per Share:

Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the year adjusted to give effect to common stock equivalents.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, for the periods indicated:



S)

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The fair values
of our registered debt, interest rate swap agreements and investments are based on quoted market prices. The fair values of other long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are estimated by discounting cash flows using period-end interest
rates and market conditions for instruments with similar maturities and credit quality. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings approximates their fair values due
to the short-term nature of these instruments. Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the fair value disclosures included elsewhere in these notes to consolidated financial statements.

T)  Use of Estimates:

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

U)  Reclassifications:

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current period presentation. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 145 “Rescission of FASB Statements Nos. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections.” Accordingly, we reclassified
$1.6 million (pre-tax), which was previously reported as an extraordinary item related to early extinguishment of debt, to interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2001.

V)  Recent Accounting Pronouncements:

In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other
than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January 2003. We will be required to apply FIN 46R to variable interests
in variable interest entities (“VIEs”) created after December 31, 2003. For variable interests in VIEs created before January 1, 2004, the Interpretation will be applied beginning on January 1, 2005. As of December 31, 2003, we do not have
any interests in entities that would be considered variable interest entities.

FASB Statement No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, was issued in May 2003. This Statement establishes standards for the classification and
measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Statement also includes required disclosures for financial instruments within its scope. Except for our minority partners’ ownership interests
in certain consolidated entities with finite lives, we currently do not have any financial instruments that are within the scope of this Statement. Based on preliminary FASB views, we could be required to record these minority interests at their
fair value at each reporting period, with changes in fair value reflected in our operating results. The effective date for this provision has been deferred indefinitely. As of December 31, 2003, we estimate that the fair value of our minority
interests approximates their carrying value.

In December 2003,
FASB Statement No. 132 (revised), Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, was issued. Statement 132 (revised) prescribes employers’ disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans; it
does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans. The Statement retains and revises the disclosure requirements contained in the original Statement 132. It also requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows,
and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The Statement generally is effective for us this year, with additional disclosures required beginning in 2004. Our disclosures in Note 10
incorporate the requirements of Statement 132 (revised).

2)

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES


— On February 1, 2004, we purchased a 90% controlling ownership interest in a 156-bed acute care facility located in New Orleans,
Louisiana.


— During 2003, we spent $281
million to acquire the assets and operations of: (i) a 108-bed behavioral health system in Anchorage and Palmer, Alaska; (ii) three acute care facilities located in France which



were acquired by an operating company that is 80% owned by us; (iii) three acute care facilities located in California, all of which are ownership effective
January 1, 2004, consisting of a 228-bed facility in Corona, a 112-bed facility in San Luis Obispo, and a 65-bed facility in Arroyo Grande; (iv) the acquisition, which is also ownership effective January 1, 2004, of a 90% controlling ownership
interest in a 306-bed acute care facility located in East New Orleans, Louisiana, and; (v) the acquisition of a behavioral health facility located in Alaska and an outpatient surgery center located in Oklahoma.

The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated on a
preliminary basis to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows:

The pro forma effect
of these acquisitions (excluding the acquisitions that are ownership effective January 1, 2004) on our net revenues, net income and basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were immaterial.

During 2003, we received total cash proceeds of $25 million
for the sale of five radiation therapy centers, two medical office buildings (which were sold to limited liability companies that are majority owned by Universal Health Realty Income Trust), an outpatient surgery center and the disposition of our
investment in a healthcare related company. These transactions resulted in a combined pre-tax gain of $15 million ($9 million after minority interest expense and income taxes) which is included in our 2003 financial statements.


— During 2002, we spent $3 million to acquire a majority
ownership interest in the assets and operations of a surgery center located in Puerto Rico. In addition, effective January 1, 2002, we acquired the assets and operations of: (i) a 150-bed acute care facility located in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, and;
(ii) a 117-bed acute care facility located in Lancaster, California. Included in other assets at December 31, 2001 were $70 million of deposits related to the acquisition of these two facilities.

The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated on a
preliminary basis to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows:



The pro forma effect of these acquisitions on our net revenues, net income and basic and diluted earnings
per share for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were immaterial.

During 2002, the we received net proceeds of $8.4 million resulting from the sale of real estate related to a women’s hospital and a radiation oncology center, both of which were closed in a prior year and
written down to their estimated net realizable values. The sale of the real estate of the women’s hospital resulted in a $2.2 million gain. The gain on the sale of the radiation center was not material.


— During 2001, we spent $263 million to acquire the assets
and operations of: (i) a 108-bed behavioral health care facility located in San Juan Capestrano, Puerto Rico; (ii) a 96-bed acute care facility located in Murrieta, California; (iii) two behavioral health care facilities located in Boston,
Massachusetts; (iv) a 60-bed specialty heart hospital located in McAllen, Texas; (v) an 80% ownership interest in an operating company that owned nine hospitals located in France; (vi) two ambulatory surgery centers located in Nevada and Louisiana;
(vii) a 150-bed acute care facility located in Lansdale, Pennsylvania (ownership effective January 1, 2002), and; (viii) a 117-bed acute care facility located in Lancaster, California (ownership effective January 1, 2002).

The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated on a
preliminary basis to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows:

The increase of $9
million in other working capital accounts at acquired facilities from their date of acquisition through December 31, 2001 consisted of the following:

The pro forma effect
of these acquisitions on the Company’s net revenues, net income and basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2001, was immaterial, as the majority of the acquisitions occurred early in 2001.

The goodwill acquired during the last three years as presented above, is
expected to be fully deductible for income tax purposes.

3)    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair Value Hedges:

We have two floating rate swaps having a notional principal amount of $60 million in which we receive a fixed rate of 6.75% and pays a floating rate equal to 6 month LIBOR plus a spread. The



term of these swaps is ten years and they are both scheduled to expire on November 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2003, the average floating rate on these
swaps was 2.56%. During 2003 we recorded a decrease of $1.6 million in other assets to recognize the fair value of these swaps and a $1.6 million decrease in long term debt to recognize the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the
related hedged liability.

Cash Flow
Hedges:

As of December 31, 2003, we had one fixed rate swap with a notional principal amount of $125 million which expires in August 2005. We pay a fixed rate of 6.76% and receive a floating rate equal to three month
LIBOR. As of December 31, 2003, the floating rate of this interest rate swap was 1.18%.

As of December 31, 2003, one of our majority-owned subsidiaries had two interest rate swaps denominated in Euros. The total notional amount of these two interest rate swaps is 35.1 million Euros ($44.2 million based
on the end of period currency exchange rate). The notional amount decreases to 27.5 million Euros ($34.6 million) on December 30, 2004, and the swaps mature on June 30, 2005. We pay an average fixed rate of 4.35% and receive six month EURIBOR. The
effective floating rate for these swaps as of December 31, 2003 was 2.17%.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), pre-tax losses of $4.9 million ($3.1 million after-tax) to recognize the change in fair value of all
derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. The gains or losses are reclassified into earnings as the underlying hedged item affects earnings, such as when the forecasted interest payment occurs. Assuming market rates remain
unchanged from December 31, 2003, it is expected that $7.1 million of pre-tax net losses in accumulated OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we also recorded
charges to earnings of $431,000 ($272,000 after-tax), $169,000 ($107,000 after-tax) and $300,000 ($189,000 after-tax), respectively, to recognize the ineffective portion of its cash flow hedging instruments. As of December 31, 2003, the maximum
length of time over which we are hedging our exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions is through August, 2005.

4)    LONG-TERM DEBT

A summary of long-term debt follows:



We have a $400 million unsecured non-amortizing revolving credit agreement, which expires on
December 13, 2006. The agreement includes a $50 million sublimit for letters of credit of which $11.6 million was available at December 31, 2003. The interest rate on borrowings is determined at our option at the prime rate, certificate of
deposit rate plus .925% to 1.275%, Euro-dollar plus .80% to 1.150% or a money market rate. A facility fee ranging from .20% to .35% is required on the total commitment. The margins over the certificate of deposit, the Euro-dollar rates and the
facility fee are based upon the our leverage ratio. At December 31, 2003, the applicable margins over the certificate of deposit and the Euro-dollar rate were 1.125% and 1.00%, respectively, and the commitment fee was .25 %. There are no
compensating balance requirements. At December 31, 2003, we had $157 million of unused borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit agreement.

During 2003, our majority-owned subsidiary in France entered into a senior credit agreement denominated in Euros which provides for a total commitment of
90 million Euros. The loan, which is non-recourse to us, amortizes to zero over the life of the agreement and matures on December 4, 2009. Interest on the loan is at our option and can be based on the one, two, three and six month EURIBOR plus a
spread of 2.00% to 2.50%. The spread in effect at December 31, 2003 was 2.25%. As of December 31, 2003, the interest rate was 4.427% (including the spread of 2.25%) and the effective interest rate including the effects of the designated interest
rate swaps and the spread of 2.25% was 6.28%. As of December 31, 2003, there was 41 million Euros ($52 million) of debt outstanding, and 48 million Euros ($61 million) of unused borrowing capacity, pursuant to the terms of this agreement.

We also have a $100 million commercial paper credit facility
which is fully collateralized by a portion of our acute care patient accounts receivable.

A commitment fee of .40% is required on the used portion and .20% on the unused portion of the commitment. This annually renewable program, which began
in November 1993, is scheduled to expire or be renewed in October of each year. Outstanding amounts of commercial paper which can be refinanced through available borrowings under our revolving credit agreement are classified as long-term. As of
December 31, 2003, we had no unused borrowing capacity under the terms of the commercial paper facility.

During 2001, we issued $200 million of Senior Notes which have a 6.75% coupon rate and which mature on November 15, 2011. (“Notes”). The
interest on the Notes is paid semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The notes can be redeemed in whole at any time and in part from time to time.

We issued discounted Convertible Debentures in 2000 which are due in 2020 (“Debentures”). The aggregate issue
price of the Debentures was $250 million or $587 million aggregate principal amount at maturity. The Debentures were issued at a price of $425.90 per $1,000 principal amount of Debenture. The Debentures’ yield to maturity is 5% per annum, .426%
of which is cash interest. The interest on the bonds is paid semiannually in arrears on June 23 and December 23 of each year. The Debentures are convertible at the option of the holders into 11.2048 shares of the our common stock per $1,000 of
Debentures, however, we have the right to redeem the Debenture any time on or after June 23, 2006 at a price equal to the issue price of the Debentures plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest to the date of redemption.

The average amounts outstanding during 2003, 2002 and 2001
under the revolving credit and demand notes and commercial paper program were $116.5 million, $140.3 million and $220.0 million. respectively, with corresponding effective interest rates of 2.89%, 3.3% and 5.1% including commitment and facility
fees. The maximum amounts outstanding at any month-end were $304.8 million in 2003, $170 million in 2002 and $343.9 million in 2001.

The effective interest rate on our revolving credit, demand notes and commercial paper program, including the respective interest expense and income
incurred on existing and now expired designated interest rate swaps, was 6.6%, 6.3% and 6.4% during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Additional interest expense recorded as a result of our U.S. dollar denominated hedging activity was $4.6 million
in 2003, $4.2 million in 2002 and $2.7 million in 2001. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counter-party to the interest rate swap agreements. All of the counter-parties are creditworthy financial institutions rated
AA or better



by Moody’s Investor Service and we do not anticipate non-performance. The estimated fair value of our cost to terminate the interest rate swap
obligations including the Euro denominated interest rate swaps, at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $7.1 million and $10.4 million respectively.

Covenants relating to long-term debt require maintenance of a minimum net worth, specified debt to total capital and fixed charge coverage ratios. We are
in compliance with all required covenants as of December 31, 2003.

The fair value of our long-term debt at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $1.00 billion and $791.1 million, respectively.

Aggregate maturities follow:

Included in the
aggregate maturities shown above, are maturities related to the Euro denominated debt ($51.9 million in the aggregate) which mature as follows: $5.2 million in 2004; $7.3 million in 2005; $11.4 million in 2006; $14.0 million in each of 2007 and
2008.

5)    COMMON STOCK

During the fourth quarter of 2003, we announced the initiation of quarterly
cash dividends, commencing with the fourth quarter of 2003. A cash dividend of $.08 per share ($4.6 million in the aggregate) was paid on December 15, 2003 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2003.

In April, 2001, we declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100%
stock dividend which was paid on June 1, 2001 to shareholders of record as of May 16, 2001. All classes of common stock participated on a pro rata basis and all references to share quantities and earnings per share for all periods presented have
been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.

During
1998 and 1999, our Board of Directors approved stock purchase programs authorizing us to purchase up to twelve million shares of its outstanding Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off
the market. Pursuant to the terms of these programs, we purchased 178,057 shares at an average purchase price of $43.33 per share ($7.7 million in the aggregate) during 2001, 1,713,787 shares at an average purchase price of $44.71 per share ($76.6
million in the aggregate) during 2002 and 1,360,321 at an average purchase price of $39.93 during 2003 ($54.3 million in the aggregate). Since inception of the stock purchase program in 1998 through December 31, 2003, we have purchased a total of
10,877,923 shares at an average purchase price of $24.92 per share ($271.1 million in the aggregate).

At December 31, 2003, 16,788,713 shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock
outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock, for issuance upon conversion of our discounted Convertible Debentures and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans. Class A, C and D Common Stock are
convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock.



As discussed in Note 1, we account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method in APB
No. 25, as permitted under SFAS No. 123. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following range of assumptions used for the seventeen option grants that occurred
during 2003, 2002 and 2001:

Stock options to
purchase Class B Common Stock have been granted to our officers, key employees and directors under various plans.

Information with respect to these options is summarized as follows:

Outstanding Options at
December 31, 2003:

All stock options were
granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of the grant. Options are exercisable ratably over a four-year period beginning one year after the date of the grant. The options expire five years after the date of the
grant. The outstanding stock options at December 31, 2003 have an average remaining contractual life of 2.2 years. At December 31, 2003, options for 1,780,964 shares were available for grant. At December 31, 2003, options for 1,581,607 shares of
Class B Common Stock with an aggregate purchase price of $47.8 million (average of $30.23 per share) were exercisable.

During the third quarter of 2002, we restructured certain elements of our long-term incentive compensation plans in response to recent changes in
regulations relating to such plans. Prior to the third quarter of 2002, we loaned employees funds (“Loan Program”) to pay the income tax liabilities incurred upon the exercise of their stock options. Advances pursuant to the Loan Program
were secured by full recourse promissory notes that were



forgiven after three years, if the borrower remained employed by us. If the forgiveness criteria were not met, the employee was required to repay the loan at
the time of separation.

During the third quarter of 2002, this
Loan Program was terminated. As a replacement long-term incentive plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the issuance of 547,061 shares (net of cancellations) of restricted stock at $51.15 per share ($28.0 million in the
aggregate) to various officers and employees pursuant to our 2001 Employees’ Restricted Stock Purchase Plan (“Restricted Stock”). The number of shares and the current value of the Restricted Stock issued to each employee were based on
the estimated benefits lost by that employee as a result of the termination of the Loan Program. The Restricted Stock is scheduled to vest ratably on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary dates of the award. Included in the Restricted Stock
granted was 319,490 restricted shares issued to the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) which are also scheduled to vest ratably on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary dates of the award. However, the shares issued to our CEO will be
awarded only if we achieve a 14% cumulative increase in earnings during the two-year period ending December 31, 2004, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002.

In connection with the Loan Program, it was our policy to charge compensation expense for the loan forgiveness over the
employees’ estimated service period or approximately six years on average. As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $4.6 million of loans outstanding in connection with the Loan Program (approximately $2.8 million of which was loaned to
officers), of which approximately $3.6 million was charged to compensation expense through that date. The balance will be charged to compensation expense over the remaining service periods (through March, 2007), assuming the forgiveness criteria are
met. In addition, as of July 1, 2002, we had recorded an additional accrual of approximately $16.0 million related to the estimated benefits earned under the Loan Program for which loans had not yet been extended. As a result of the termination of
the Loan Program, this accrued liability was adjusted by reducing compensation expense by $16.0 million during 2002 (the majority of which was recorded during the third quarter of 2002) since we do not have any future obligations related to the
benefits that employees might have been entitled to if the Loan Program had continued.

Since the Restricted Stock awards were primarily intended to replace the benefits that had been earned under the Loan Program, a portion of the awards was attributable to services rendered by employees in prior
periods. Accordingly, in connection with the issuance of the Restricted Stock awards during 2002, during the third quarter of 2002 we recorded approximately $14.1 million of compensation expense which represented the prior service portion of the
expense related to the Restricted Stock awards. During the fourth quarter of 2002, an additional $1.2 million of compensation expense was recorded related to the Restricted Stock awards. The remaining expense associated with the Restricted Stock
awards (estimated at $9.5 million, net of cancellations, as of December 31, 2003, but subject to adjustment based on the market value of the shares granted to our CEO) will be recorded over the vesting periods of the awards (through the third
quarter of 2007), assuming the recipients remain employed by us.

In addition to the stock option plan we have the following stock incentive and purchase plans: (i) a Stock Compensation Plan which expires in November, 2004 under which Class B Common Shares may be granted to key employees, consultants and
independent contractors (officers and directors are ineligible); (ii) a Stock Ownership Plan whereby eligible employees (officers of the Company are no longer eligible) may purchase shares of Class B Common Stock directly from us at current market
value and we will loan each eligible employee 90% of the purchase price for the shares, subject to certain limitations, (loans are partially recourse to the employees); (iii) a 2001 Restricted Stock Purchase Plan which allows eligible participants
to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock at par value, subject to certain restrictions (6,081 shares issued during 2003), and; (iv) a Stock Purchase Plan which allows eligible employees to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock at a ten percent
discount. We have reserved 3.4 million shares of Class B Common Stock for issuance under these various plans and have issued 1.8 million shares pursuant to the terms of these plans as of December 31, 2003, of which 0, 38,432 and 3,542 became fully
vested during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In connection
with the long-term incentive plans described above, we recorded net compensation expense of $4.8 million in 2003, $3.6 million in 2002 and $12.6 million in 2001.



6)    INCOME TAXES

Components of income taxes are as follows:

We account for income
taxes under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” (SFAS 109). Under SFAS 109, deferred taxes are required to be classified based on the financial statement classification of
the related assets and liabilities which give rise to temporary differences. Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The components of deferred
taxes are as follows:

A reconciliation
between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate is as follows:



The net deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised as follows:

The assets and
liabilities classified as current relate primarily to the allowance for uncollectible patient accounts and the current portion of the temporary differences related to self-insurance reserves. Under SFAS 109, a valuation allowance is required when it
is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that all
the deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, we have not provided a valuation allowance. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward
period are reduced.

7)    LEASE COMMITMENTS

Certain of our hospital and medical office facilities and
equipment are held under operating or capital leases which expire through 2008 (See Note 9). Certain of these leases also contain provisions allowing us to purchase the leased assets during the term or at the expiration of the lease at fair market
value.

A summary of property under capital lease follows:



Future minimum rental payments under lease commitments with a term of more than one year as of December
31, 2003, are as follows:

Capital lease
obligations of $10.1 million in 2003, $9.5 million in 2002 and $10.6 million in 2001 were incurred when the Company entered into capital leases for new equipment or assumed capital lease obligations upon the acquisition of facilities.

8)    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Due to unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional and
general liability insurance markets, our subsidiaries have assumed a greater portion of the hospital professional and general liability risk as the cost of commercial professional and general liability insurance coverage has risen significantly. As
a result, effective January 1, 2002, most of our subsidiaries were self-insured for malpractice exposure up to $25 million per occurrence. We purchased an umbrella excess policy for our subsidiaries through a commercial insurance carrier for
coverage in excess of $25 million per occurrence with a $75 million aggregate limitation. Given these insurance market conditions, there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in claims asserted
against us, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

For the period from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2001, most of our subsidiaries were covered under commercial insurance policies with PHICO, a Pennsylvania based insurance company that was placed into
liquidation during the first quarter of 2002. As a result of PHICO’s liquidation, we recorded a $40 million pre-tax charge during 2001 to reserve for PHICO claims that could become our liability, however, we are entitled to receive
reimbursement from state insurance guaranty funds, other commercial insurers and/or PHICO’s estate for a portion of certain claims ultimately paid by us.

Our estimated liability for professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of
asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under
our commercial insurance policies. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making
this estimate.

As of December 31, 2003, the total accrual for
our professional and general liability claims, was $190.8 million ($147.7 million net of expected recoveries), of which $35.0 million is included in other current liabilities. As of December 31, 2002, the total reserve for our professional and
general liability claims was $168.2 million ($131.2 million net of expected recoveries), of which $12 million is included in other current liabilities. Included



in other assets was $43.0 million as of December 31, 2003, and $37.0 million as of December 31, 2002, related to estimated expected recoveries from various
state guaranty funds, insurance companies and other sources in connection with PHICO related professional and general liability claims payments.

As of December 31, 2003, we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling $40 million consisting of: (i) $34 million related to our
self-insurance programs, and; (ii) $6 million consisting primarily of collateral for outstanding bonds of an unaffiliated third party and public utility.

We have a long-term contract with a third party, that expires in 2012, to provide certain data processing services for our acute care and behavioral
health facilities.

In addition, various suits and claims
arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which
include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government action has increased with
respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers. Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded
from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from government for previously billed patient services. While management believes its policies, procedures and practices
comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to governmental inquiries or actions.

The confidentiality of patient medical records and other health information is subject to considerable regulation by state and federal governments.
Legislation and regulations governing the dissemination and use of medical record information are being proposed continually at both the state and federal levels. For example, the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) mandate that standards and requirements be adopted for the electronic transmission of certain health information. The Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has issued
regulations to comport with this mandate to create standards for unique health care services provider identifiers and security requirements. In August 2002, HHS issued final modifications to the rule regarding privacy standards covering health
plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers (called “covered entities”).

Our facilities, which are covered entities, were required to comply with the provisions of this final rule by April 14, 2003. In addition, HHS has
published final regulations adopting standards for specific types of electronic administrative and financial health care transactions and for the code sets used in conjunction with those transactions. Covered entities were required to comply with
these regulations no later than October 16, 2003. Because violation of these HIPAA regulations may result in significant fines against us, we applied for and received an extension of the compliance deadline. We are employing best efforts to assure
that its policies, procedures and electronic billing practices comply with these regulations. We do not expect that the implementation of or compliance with these standards will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations. Nonetheless, because the standards imposed by these regulations are very complex, it is still uncertain what our costs of complying with these standards will be. Accordingly, there can neither be any assurance that we will not be
subjected to governmental inquiries, actions or fines relating to these regulations, nor that the implementation of the HIPAA standards will not affect our financial condition or the future results of operations. In addition, failure by third
parties on which we rely, including payors, to resolve HIPAA related implementation issues could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and its ability to provide health care services.



9)    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

At December 31, 2003, we held approximately 6.6% of the outstanding shares
of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the “Trust”). We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement. Pursuant to the terms of this advisory agreement, we conduct the Trust’s day-to-day affairs,
provide administrative services and presents investment opportunities. In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust. Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence
over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting. Our pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $1.6 million during 2003, $1.4 million during 2002 and $1.3 million during 2001, and is
included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The carrying value of this investment was $9.4 million and $9.1 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. The market value of this investment was $23.4 million at December 31, 2003 and $20.3 million at December 31, 2002.

As of December 31, 2003, we leased six hospital facilities from the Trust with terms expiring in 2004 through 2008. These leases contain up to five 5-year
renewal options. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds non-controlling ownership interest.

During 2003, we sold four medical office buildings located in Las Vegas,
Nevada, for combined cash proceeds of $12.8 million, to limited liability companies, in which the Trust holds non-controlling majority ownership interests. The sale of these medical office buildings resulted in a pre-minority interest and pre-tax
gain of $3.1 million ($1.4 million after minority interest expense and after-tax) which is included in our 2003 results of operations. Tenants of these buildings include certain of our subsidiaries.

The leases on one acute care hospital and one behavioral health hospital
leased from the Trust are scheduled to expire in December, 2004. We have an option at the end of the lease terms to purchase the properties at their fair market value or renew the leases at the same terms for another five years. Under the terms of
these leases, we are required to notify the Trust of our intent to renew by June 30, 2004. During 2002, we exercised the five-year renewal option on an acute care hospital leased from the Trust which was scheduled to expire in March, 2003. The
renewal rate on this facility was based upon the five-year Treasury rate on March 29, 2003 plus a spread.

Future minimum lease payments to the Trust are included in Note 7. Total rent expense under these operating leases was $17.4 million in 2003, $17.2
million in 2002 and $16.5 million in 2001. The terms of the leases provide that in the event we discontinue operations at the leased facility for more than one year, we are obligated to offer a substitute property. If the Trust does not accept the
substitute property offered, we are obligated to purchase the leased facility back from the Trust at a price equal to the greater of its then fair market value or the original purchase price paid by the Trust. As of December 31, 2003, the aggregate
fair market value of our facilities leased from the Trust is not known, however, the aggregate original purchase price paid by the Trust for these properties was $112.5 million. We received an advisory fee from the Trust of $1.5 million in 2003,
$1.4 million in 2002 and $1.3 million in 2001 for investment and administrative services provided under a contractual agreement which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

In connection with a long-term incentive compensation plan that was
terminated during the third quarter of 2002, we had $4.6 million as of December 31, 2003 and $17.7 million as of December 31, 2002, of gross loans outstanding to various employees of which $3.6 million as of December 31, 2003 and $15.1 million as of
December 31, 2002 were charged to compensation expense through that date. Included in the amounts outstanding were gross loans to our officers amounting to $2.8 million as of December 31, 2003 and $13.2 million as of December 31, 2002 (see Note 5).

Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is member of the
Board of Directors of Broadlane, Inc. In addition, the Company and certain members of executive management own approximately 6% of the outstanding



shares of Broadlane, Inc. as of December 31, 2003. Broadlane, Inc. provides contracting and other supply chain services to us and various other healthcare
organizations.

A member of our Board of Directors and
member of the Executive Committee is Of Counsel to the law firm used by us as our principal outside counsel. This Board member is also the trustee of certain trusts for the benefit of the Chief Executive Officer and his family. This law firm also
provides personal legal services to our Chief Executive Officer.

We invested $3.3 million for a 25% ownership interest in an information technology company that provides laboratory information system and order management technology to many of our acute care hospitals.

10)    PENSION PLAN

We maintain contributory and non-contributory retirement plans for eligible
employees. Our contributions to the contributory plan amounted to $11.6 million, $7.2 million and $6.2 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The non-contributory plan is a defined benefit pension plan which covers employees of one of our
subsidiaries. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee’s highest compensation for any five years of employment. Our funding policy is to contribute annually at least the minimum amount that should be funded in accordance with
the provisions of ERISA.



The following table shows the reconciliation of the defined benefit pension plan as of December 31, 2003
and 2002:



The accumulated benefit obligation was $65,162 and $56,584 as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligations of the plan as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. In 2003 and 2002, the accrued pension cost is included in non-current liabilities in the accompanying balance
sheet.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets assumption, we considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio.

Investment Policy,
Guidelines and Objectives have been established for the defined benefit pension plan. The investment policy is in keeping with the fiduciary requirements under existing federal laws and managed in accordance with the prudent investor rule. Total
portfolio risk is regularly evaluated and compared to that of the plan’s policy target allocation and judged on a relative basis over a market cycle. The following asset allocation policy and ranges have been established in accordance with the
overall risk and return objectives of the portfolio:

Policy

In accordance with our
investment policy, the portfolio will invest in high quality, large and small capitalization companies traded on national exchanges, and investment grade securities. The investment managers will not write or buy options for speculative purposes;
securities may not be margined or sold short. The manager may employ futures or options for the purpose of hedging exposure, but may not purchase unregistered sectors, private placements, partnerships or commodities.

11)    SEGMENT REPORTING

Our reportable operating segments consist of acute care hospital services
(includes hospitals located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico), behavioral health care services and international acute care hospital services consisting of twelve hospitals located in France. The operating results for our facilities located in France are
included in the “International” segment in 2003 and since they were included in the “Other” segment in prior years, the segment data for 2002 and 2001 have been restated to conform to the current year presentation. The
“Other” segment column below includes centralized services including information services, purchasing, reimbursement, accounting, taxation, legal, advertising, design and construction, and patient accounting as well as the operating
results for the our other operating entities including outpatient surgery and radiation centers. The chief operating decision making group for our acute care hospital services, behavioral health care services and international acute care hospital
services is comprised of the President and Chief Executive Officer, and the lead executives of each operating segment. The lead executive for each operating segment also manages the profitability of each respective segment’s various hospitals.
The operating segments are managed separately because each operating segment represents a business unit that offers different types of healthcare services or operates in different healthcare environments. The accounting policies of the operating
segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003.



(a)

Operating income is defined as net revenues less salaries, wages & benefits, other operating expenses, supplies expense and provision for doubtful accounts. Below is a
reconciliation of consolidated operating income to consolidated net income before income taxes and extraordinary charge for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:



12)    QUARTERLY RESULTS

The following tables summarize our quarterly financial data for the two years ended December 31, 2003:

Net revenues in 2003
include $27.8 million of additional revenues received from Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) funds in Texas and South Carolina. Of this amount, $6.3 million was recorded in the first quarter, $7.0 million in the second
quarter, $8.1 million in the third quarter and $6.4 million in the fourth quarter. These amounts were recorded in periods that we met all of the requirements to be entitled to these reimbursements. Included in our results during the third quarter is
a $7.8 million pre-tax gain ($4.4 million, net of taxes and minority interest expense) recorded on the sale of three radiation therapy center and three medical office buildings. Included in our results during the fourth quarter is a net pre-tax
increase to income of $1.9 million ($1.2 million or $.02 per diluted share, net of taxes) consisting of the following: (i) a pre-tax increase of $8.8 million ($5.6 million or $.08 per diluted share, net of taxes) resulting from the reversal of an
accrued liability (including accrued interest) due to a favorable Texas Supreme Court decision which reversed an unfavorable 2000 jury verdict and 2001 appellate court decision; (ii) a pre-tax increase of $6.8 million ($4.3 million or $.07 per
diluted share, net of taxes) resulting from a gain realized on the disposition of an investment in a health-care related company, and; (iii) a pre-tax charge of $13.7 million ($8.7 million or $.13 per diluted share, net of taxes) resulting from the
write-down of the carrying value of an acute care pediatric hospital located in Puerto Rico to its estimated realizable value.

Net revenues in 2002
include $33.0 million of additional revenues received from DSH funds in Texas and South Carolina. Of this amount, $8.4 million was recorded in the first quarter, $8.8 million in the second quarter, $7.0 million in the third quarter and $8.8 million
in the fourth quarter. These amounts were recorded in periods that we met all of the requirements to be entitled to these reimbursements. Included in our results during the fourth quarter of 2002 is a $2.2 million pre-tax gain ($1.4 million, net of
taxes) on the sale of the real estate of a hospital that was closed in 2001 ($.02 per diluted share, net of taxes).
