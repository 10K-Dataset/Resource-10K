PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

Our principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers. As of February 25, 2010, we owned
and/or operated or had under construction, 25 acute care hospitals (excluding 1 new replacement facility currently being constructed) and 102 behavioral health centers located in 32 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. As part of our ambulatory
treatment centers division, we manage and/or own outright or in partnerships with physicians, 7 surgical hospitals and surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 5 states and Puerto Rico.

Net revenues from our acute care hospitals, surgical hospitals, surgery centers and radiation oncology centers accounted for 74% of our
consolidated net revenues in each of 2009, 2008 and 2007. Net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities accounted for 25% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2009, 2008 and 2007. Approximately 1% in each of 2009, 2008 and 2007
of our consolidated net revenues were recorded in connection with two construction management contracts pursuant to the terms of which we built newly constructed acute care hospitals for an unrelated third party.

Services provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology,
oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and behavioral health services. We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information
services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.

We are a Delaware corporation that was organized in 1979. Our principal executive offices are located at Universal Corporate Center, 367 South Gulph Road, P.O. Box 61558, King of Prussia, PA 19406. Our
telephone number is (610) 768-3300.

Our Mission

Our mission and objective is to provide superior healthcare services that patients recommend to families and friends, physicians prefer for
their patients, purchasers select for their clients, employees are proud of, and investors seek for long-term results. To achieve this, we have a commitment to:

•

service excellence

•

continuous improvement in measurable ways



•

employee development

•

ethical and fair treatment

•

teamwork

•

compassion

•

innovation in service delivery

Business Strategy

We believe community-based hospitals will remain
the focal point of the healthcare delivery network and we are committed to a philosophy of self-determination for both the company and our hospitals.

Acquisition of Additional Hospitals.

We selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by acquiring, constructing or leasing additional hospital facilities. We are committed
to a program of rational growth around our core businesses, while retaining the missions of the hospitals we manage and the communities we serve. Such expansion may provide us with access to new markets and new healthcare delivery capabilities. We
also continue to examine our facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities that we believe do not have the potential to contribute to our growth or operating strategy.

Improvement of Operations of Existing Hospitals and Services.

We also seek to increase the operating revenues and profitability
of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services, improvement of existing services, physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls.

We are involved in continual development activities for the benefit of our existing facilities. Applications to state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals are currently on
file in states which require certificates of need, or CONs. Although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our operations, no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in these
efforts.

Quality and Efficiency of Services.

Pressures to contain healthcare costs and technological developments
allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible. We are responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services. In addition,
in response to cost containment pressures, we continue to implement programs at our facilities designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while continuing to provide quality care, including more efficient use of professional and
paraprofessional staff, monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage, improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more efficient billing and collection procedures. In addition, we will continue to emphasize
innovation in our response to the rapid changes in regulatory trends and market conditions while fulfilling our commitment to patients, physicians, employees, communities and our shareholders.

In addition, our aggressive recruiting of highly qualified physicians and developing provider networks help to establish our facilities as
an important source of quality healthcare in their respective communities.

2009 Acquisition and Divestiture Activities

Acquisitions:

During 2009, we spent $12 million on the acquisition of businesses and real property, including the following:

•

the acquisition of a 72-bed behavioral health care facility located in Louisville, Colorado, and;

•

the acquisition of the real property assets of a medical office building located on the campus of one of our acute care hospitals located in Texas.



Divestitures:

During 2009, we received $10 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:

•

the sale of the real property assets of a medical office building on the campus of a previously divested acute care facility located in Pennsylvania,
and;

•

the sale of our ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center.

Hospital Utilization

We believe that the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital include the quality and market position of the hospital and the number, quality and specialties of physicians
providing patient care within the facility. Generally, we believe that the ability of a hospital to meet the health care needs of its community is determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of care and
convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that affect utilization include general and local economic conditions, market penetration of managed care programs, the degree of outpatient use, the availability of reimbursement programs such
as Medicare and Medicaid, and demographic changes such as the growth in local populations. Utilization across the industry also is being affected by improvements in clinical practice, medical technology and pharmacology. Current industry trends in
utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors. We are also unable to predict the extent to which these industry trends will continue or accelerate. In addition, hospital
operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, such as higher patient volumes and net patient service revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year.



The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for hospitals operated by us for
the years indicated. Accordingly, information related to hospitals acquired during the five-year period has been included from the respective dates of acquisition, and information related to hospitals divested during the five-year period has been
included up to the respective dates of divestiture.

(1)

The acute care facilities located in Puerto Rico were divested by us during the first quarter of 2005 and Central Montgomery Medical Center located in Pennsylvania was
divested during the fourth quarter of 2008. The statistical information for these facilities is included in the above information through the divestiture date.

(2)

The facilities located in France were divested by us during the second quarter of 2005 and the statistical information for these facilities is included in the above
information through the divestiture date.

(3)

“Average Available Beds” is the number of beds which are actually in service at any given time for immediate patient use with the necessary equipment and
staff available for patient care. A hospital may have appropriate licenses for more beds than are in service for a number of reasons, including lack of demand, incomplete construction, and anticipation of future needs.

(4)

“Patient Days” is the sum of all patients for the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient.

(5)

“Occupancy Rate” is calculated by dividing average patient days (total patient days divided by the total number of days in the period) by the number of
average beds, either available or licensed.



Sources of Revenue

We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare
program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients. See

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Sources of Revenue

for additional
disclosure. Other information related to our revenues, income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements,

Segment Reporting.

Regulation and Other Factors

Overview:

The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including among others those related to government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure
and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse provisions (including, but not limited to, federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and
other illegal inducements to potential referral sources, false claims submitted to federal health care programs and self-referrals by physicians). Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from
participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. Although we believe our policies, procedures and
practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions, or that we would not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties if so subjected. Even if we
were to ultimately prevail, a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us.

Licensing, Certification and Accreditation:

All of our hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local statutes and regulations and receive periodic inspection by
state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care, equipment and cleanliness. Our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal, state and local health agencies, as well as the
requirements of municipal building codes, health codes and local fire departments. Various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment.

All our eligible hospitals have been accredited by the Joint Commission. All of our acute care hospitals and most of our
behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.

If any of our facilities were to lose its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid
programs and other payors. Although we believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards, please see Item

1A. Risk Factors

on page 21
of this Report for disclosure regarding ongoing matters with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in connection with our Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital and Southwest Healthcare System. The requirements for licensure, certification and
accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on operations.

Certificates of Need:

Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need
(“CON”) laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services. Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our inability to complete an
acquisition, expansion or replacement, the imposition of civil or, in some cases, criminal sanctions, the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility’s license, which could harm our business. In
addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements. In the past, we have not experienced any material
adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.



Conversion Legislation:

Many states have enacted or are considering enacting
laws affecting the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities. These laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general, advance notification and community involvement. In addition, attorneys general in states
without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions. Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some
cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a health care facility to a for-profit entity. The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions may limit
our ability to grow through acquisitions of not-for-profit hospitals.

Utilization Review:

Federal regulations
require that admissions and utilization of facilities by Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services. The law and regulations require Peer Review Organizations
(“PROs”) to review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of diagnosis related group (“DRG”) classifications and the appropriateness of cases of
extraordinary length of stay. PROs may deny payment for services provided, assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) that a provider that is in substantial non-compliance
with the standards of the PRO be excluded from participating in the Medicare program. We have contracted with PROs in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews.

Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation

The Stark Law:

The Social Security Act includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities
with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception is met. These types of referrals are known as “self-referrals.” Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include civil penalties up to
$15,000 for each violation, up to $100,000 for sham arrangements, up to $10,000 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal health care programs. There are a number of exceptions to the self-referral
prohibition, including an exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit, service or subpart. There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial
arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements.

We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Nonetheless
because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the Stark Law.

Anti-kickback Statute:

A provision of the Social Security Act known as the “anti-kickback statute” prohibits
healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using, referring, ordering, recommending or arranging for such
referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state health care program.

The anti-kickback statute
contains certain exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) has issued regulations that provide for “safe harbors,” from the federal anti-kickback statute for
various activities. These activities, which must meet certain requirements, include (but are not limited to) the following: investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts,
sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in
group practices, freestanding surgery centers, donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services. The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe



harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti- kickback statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to
increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.

Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians have been
structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements
do not violate the anti-kickback statute or other applicable laws. Violations of the anti-kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, however, under 18 U.S.C. Section 3571, this fine
may be increased to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations. Civil money penalties may include fines of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from
participation in Medicare and Medicaid.

Similar State Laws:

Many of the states in which we operate have adopted
laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care. These statutes typically provide criminal and civil
penalties as well as loss of licensure. In many instances, the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes. However, in most cases, little precedent exists for
the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws.

These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases,
we don’t have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation. It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or
illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that
we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws (see “Legal Proceedings”), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could
suffer significantly. In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.

If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could
be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal
and state health care programs. The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Regulations:

A current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and, in particular, actions
being brought by individuals on the government’s behalf under the False Claims Act’s qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions. Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that
the defendant has defrauded the Federal government.

When a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the
False Claims Act, the defendant must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the
False Claims Act. Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The recent enactment of the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act has expanded the number of actions for which
liability may attach under the False Claims Act, eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act also clarifies that a false claim violation
occurs upon the knowing retention, as well as the receipt, of overpayments. In addition, a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit
on behalf of the state in state court.

Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions:

The Social Security Act also imposes
criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for



services not rendered, billing for services without prescribed documentation, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud. Like the
anti-kickback statute, these provisions are very broad.

Further, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996 (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs, whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to
federal programs. HIPAA also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in Medicare. There are civil penalties for prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy Requirements:

The administrative simplification provisions of
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received
electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. HIPAA also established new federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information. The privacy and security
regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed. Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and
penalties.

Compliance with the electronic data transmission standards became mandatory in October 2003. However, during the
following year HHS agreed to allow providers and other electronic billers to continue to submit pre-HIPAA format electronic claims for periods after October 16, 2003, provided they can show good faith efforts to become HIPAA compliant. Since
this exception expired, we believe that we have been in compliance with the electronic data transmission standards.

We were
required to comply with the privacy requirements of HIPAA by April 14, 2003. We believe that we were in material compliance with the privacy regulations by that date and remain so, as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to
address ongoing compliance. The HIPAA security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of patient information. HITECH has
since strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates, and created new security breach notification requirements. HITECH has also extended
the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a HIPAA violation has occurred. We were required to comply with the security regulations by April 20, 2005 and believe that we have been in substantial compliance with HIPAA
and HITECH requirements to date.

Environmental Regulations:

Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that
must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. Infectious waste generators, including hospitals, face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste, including civil penalties
of up to $25,000 per day of noncompliance, criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day, imprisonment, and remedial costs. In addition, our operations, as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws,
rules and regulations. We believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws.

Corporate Practice of Medicine:

Several states, including Florida, Nevada and Texas, have passed legislation that prohibits corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that
prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and
services. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These statutes
vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies. We do not expect this legislation to significantly affect our operations. Many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments
for referral of patients and fee-splitting with physicians. We do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements.



EMTALA:

All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and
Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”). This federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under Medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospital’s emergency room for treatment
and, if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency, to either stabilize the patient’s condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition. Our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical
conditions exists regardless of a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in
order to first inquire about the patient’s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program. In addition, an injured patient, the patient’s family
or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital.

The federal government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospital’s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to
the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions. EMTALA does not generally apply to patients admitted for
inpatient services. The government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively in the future. We believe that we operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.

Health Care Industry Investigations:

We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those
arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation. Please see

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

included herein for disclosure related to: (i) Litigation and
Administrative Appeal of CMS’s Attempt to Terminate Medicare Participation of Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital, and: (ii) False Claim Act case against Virginia Behavioral Health Facilities.

We and our South Texas Health System affiliates, which operate McAllen Medical Center, McAllen Heart Hospital, Edinburg Regional Medical
Center and certain other affiliates, were served with a subpoena dated November 21, 2005, issued by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”). At that time, the Civil Division of the U.S.
Attorney’s office in Houston, Texas indicated that the subpoena was part of an investigation under the False Claims Act regarding compliance with Medicare and Medicaid rules and regulations pertaining to payments to physicians and the
solicitation of patient referrals from physicians from January 1, 1999 to the date of the subpoena, related to the South Texas Health System. The Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s office in Houston, Texas focused on certain
arrangements entered into by the South Texas Health System affiliates which, the government believes, may have violated Medicare and Medicaid rules and regulations pertaining to payments to physicians and the solicitation of patient referrals from
physicians and other matters relating to payments to various individuals which may have constituted improper payments. We cooperated with the investigations and, during the fourth quarter of 2009, reached an agreement to resolve the matter. We
agreed to make a payment in the amount of $ 27.5 million, which was paid in October of 2009, and, with respect to the South Texas Health System affiliates, we have entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with
the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services. The CIA requires South Texas Health System affiliates to develop and implement an enhanced compliance program and contains specific reporting requirements. During
2008, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $25 million to establish a reserve in connection with this matter and recorded an additional $3 million during 2009. Also during 2009, we recorded a $4.3 million unfavorable discrete tax item to reflect the
estimated nondeductible portion of the amount reserved. We do not expect to incur additional material charges with respect to this matter.

We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the
law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices
comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to



inquiries or actions, or that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with the investigations. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, the government’s inquiry
and/or action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.

Our
substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations. It is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters
could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executives and/or managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation and/or named as defendants in private
litigation.

Revenue Rulings 98-15 and 2004-51:

In March 1998 and May 2004, the IRS issued guidance regarding
the tax consequences of joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals. As a result of the tax rulings, the IRS has proposed, and may in the future propose, to revoke the tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit
entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them. The tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts
regarding the tax-exempt or public charity status of a not-for-profit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or
require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with not-for-profits.

State Rate Review:

Some states
where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state. In the aggregate, state rate
reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations.

Compliance
Program:

Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1998. Currently, the program’s elements include a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for
reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs, and a means for enforcing the program’s policies.

Since its
initial adoption, the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industry’s expectations and our needs. Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and
monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business. Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our
program. Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing, and cost reports, comprise the bulk of these areas. Financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, including compliance with anti-kickback and Stark laws and
emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training, standardized documentation requirements, and review and audit.

Medical Staff and Employees

Our facilities had approximately 39,900
employees on December 31, 2009, of whom approximately 28,100 were employed full-time. Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals. With a few exceptions, physicians are
not employees of our hospitals and in a number of our markets, may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours. Approximately 100 physicians are employed either directly by certain of our acute care facilities or affiliated by
group practices structured as 501A corporations. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. We employ approximately
130 psychiatrists within our behavioral health division. Each of our hospitals are managed on a day-to-day basis by a managing director employed by us. In addition, a Board of Governors, including members of the hospital’s medical staff,
governs the medical, professional and ethical practices at each hospital.



Approximately 2,000 of our employees at six of our hospitals are unionized. At Valley
Hospital Medical Center, unionized employees belong to the Culinary Workers and Bartenders Union, the International Union of Operating Engineers and the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”). Nurses and technicians at Desert
Springs Hospital are represented by the SEIU. Registered nurses at Auburn Regional Medical Center located in Washington, are represented by the United Staff Nurses Union, the technical employees are represented by the United Food and Commercial
Workers, and the service employees are represented by the SEIU. At The George Washington University Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the SEIU or the Hospital Police Association. Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, certain
technicians and therapists, pharmacy assistants, and some clerical employees at HRI Hospital in Boston are represented by the SEIU. At Pennsylvania Clinical Schools, unionized employees are represented by the District Council 88, American Federation
of State, County and Municipal Employees—AFL-CIO. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.

Competition

The health care industry is highly competitive. In recent years, competition among
healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the United States due to, among other things, regulatory and technological changes, increasing use of managed care payment systems, cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient
treatment. In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals. In addition, some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported
governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sale and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to us.

In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services
than us. Certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical, surgical and behavioral health services, facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals. The
increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities, outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us.

The number and quality of the physicians on a hospital’s staff are important factors in determining a hospital’s success and competitive advantage. Typically, physicians are responsible for
making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment. We believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patient’s needs, the quality of other physicians on the medical staff,
the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospital’s facilities. We strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support
personnel, technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians.

In addition, we depend
on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals. We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified
hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel. Our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide, which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in
salaries, wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate. In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels. To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may by required to
limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.

Many states in which we operate hospitals have CON laws. The application process for approval of additional covered services, new facilities, changes in operations and capital expenditures is, therefore, highly competitive in these states.
In those states that do not have CON laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. See
“Regulation and Other Factors.”



Our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care
services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals. Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of
payment. In addition, employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges. In return, hospitals secure
commitments for a larger number of potential patients. Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality
of the medical staff and convenience. The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations.

A key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets. The competition to
acquire hospitals is significant. We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit health care companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do. We intend to
selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth, but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms.

Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust

At December 31, 2009, we held approximately 6.5% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the
“Trust”). We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement pursuant to the terms of which, we conduct the Trust’s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities.
In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust. Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust
using the equity method of accounting. We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $1.6 million during each of 2009 and 2008 and $1.4 million
during 2007. Our pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $1.1 million during 2009, $900,000 during 2008 and $1.5 million during 2007 and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year. The carrying
value of this investment was $8.1 million and $8.9 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The market value of this investment was $25.2 million at
December 31, 2009 and $25.9 million at December 31, 2008, based on the closing price of the Trust’s stock on the respective dates.

Total rent expense under the operating leases on the hospital facilities with the Trust was $16.3 million during 2009 and $16.1 million during each of 2008 and 2007. In addition, certain of our
subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds noncontrolling ownership interests.

The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries. Most of the leases were entered into at the time
the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5-year renewal terms. Each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below. The base rents are paid monthly and the
bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year. The leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are
cross-defaulted with one another.

Pursuant to the terms of the leases with the Trust, we have the option to renew the leases
at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term. In addition, we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and
for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or; (ii) renew the lease on



the respective leased facility at the end of, and for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer. We also have the right to purchase the
respective leased facilities at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at the appraised fair market value. In addition, during 2006, as part of the overall exchange and substitution transaction relating to Chalmette Medical Center
(“Chalmette”) which was completed during the third quarter of 2006, as well as the early five year lease renewals on Southwest Healthcare System-Inland Valley Campus (“Inland Valley”), Wellington Regional Medical Center
(“Wellington”), McAllen Medical Center and The Bridgeway (“Bridgeway”), the Trust agreed to amend the Master Lease to include a change of control provision. The change of control provision grants us the right, upon one
month’s notice should a change of control of the Trust occur, to purchase any or all of the four leased hospital properties at their appraised fair market value purchase price.

The table below details the renewal options and terms for each of our four hospital facilities leased from the Trust:

(a)

We have four 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2031).

(b)

We have two 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2021) and two 5-year renewal options at fair market value lease rates (2022 through 2031).

(c)

We have two 5-year renewal options at fair market value lease rates (2015 through 2024).

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

We are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, could also impact our business and results of operations.

A significant portion of our revenue is produced by facilities located in Nevada, Texas and California.

Nevada:

We own six acute care hospitals and two behavioral health care facilities as listed in

Item 2. Properties

. On a
combined basis these facilities contributed 24% in 2009, 24% in 2008, and 23% in 2007 of our consolidated net revenues. On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 14% in 2009, 18% in
2008, and 25% in 2007 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.

Texas:

We own eight acute care hospitals and eight behavioral health care facilities as listed in

Item 2. Properties

. On a combined basis these facilities contributed 20% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2009, 2008 and 2007. On a
combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 16% in 2009, 8% in 2008, and 2% in 2007 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.

California:

We own four acute care hospitals (excluding one replacement facility currently being constructed) and nine behavioral
health care facilities as listed in

Item 2. Properties

. On a combined basis these facilities contributed 10% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2009, 2008 and 2007. On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate
overhead expense, these facilities generated 5% in 2009, 7% in 2008, and 3% in 2007 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.

The significant portion of our revenues and earnings derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic,
environmental and competition changes in Nevada, Texas and California. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our
overall business results.

Our revenues and results of operations are significantly affected by payments received from
the government and other third party payors.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from third party payors,
including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and, in some cases, reduced levels of reimbursement for health care services. Payments from federal and
state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially
increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities. We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations. In addition, the uncertainty
and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of, among other things, the substantial deterioration in general economic conditions, the funding requirements from the federal government’s stimulus package, the War on
Terrorism and the relief



efforts related to hurricanes and other disasters, may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs. If the rates paid or the scope of services covered by
government payors are reduced, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations.

We receive a large concentration of our Medicaid revenues from Texas and significant amounts from Nevada, Florida, California, Washington, D.C. and Illinois. These states, as well as most other states in which we operate, have reported
significant budget deficits that have resulted in a reduction of Medicaid funding for 2009. We can provide no assurance that reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in these states, will not have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to changes in government reimbursement programs, our ability to
negotiate favorable contracts with private payors, including managed care providers, significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals. Private payors, including managed care providers, increasingly are demanding that we
accept lower rates of payment.

We expect continued third party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost
controls. Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.

We are required to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay.

In accordance with our internal policies and procedures, as well as EMTALA, we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who
comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor and/or seeking medical treatment (whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay) to determine if such individual has an emergency medical
condition. If it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition, we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patient’s medical condition, within the facility’s capability, or
arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the treating hospital’s written procedures. If the number of indigent and charity care patients with emergency medical conditions we treat
increases significantly, our results of operations will be harmed.

An increase in uninsured and underinsured patients
in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations.

Collection of receivables from third-party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the
portion of the bill that is the patient’s responsibility, which primarily includes co-payments and deductibles. We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix, the agings of the receivables and
historical collection experience. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our
allowances as warranted. Significant changes in business office operations, payor mix, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flow and results of
operations. If we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses, our results of operations will be harmed.

A worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States could materially affect our business and future results of operations.

Our patient volumes, revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance which to a large
extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets. A continuation or worsening of economic conditions may result in a continued increase in the unemployment rate



which will likely increase the number of individuals without health insurance. As a result, our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes, particularly in less intense, more
elective service lines, or a significant increase in services provided to uninsured patients. These factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes, revenues and operating results.

We are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform.

An increasing number of legislative initiatives have been introduced or proposed in recent years that would result in major changes in the
health care delivery system on a national or a state level. Among the proposals that have been introduced are price controls on hospitals, insurance market reforms to increase the availability of group health insurance to small businesses,
requirements that all businesses offer health insurance coverage to their employees and the creation of government health insurance plans that would cover all citizens and increase payments by beneficiaries. We cannot predict whether any of the
above proposals or other proposals will be adopted and, if adopted, no assurances can be given that their implementation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.

The health care industry is highly competitive and competition among hospitals and other health care providers for patients and physicians
has intensified in recent years. In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals. Some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax
supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sales and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to us.

In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services
than we. The number of inpatient facilities, as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers, many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians, in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly. As a result, most
of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment.

If our competitors are better able to attract patients,
recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities, we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed.

Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.

Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment. As a
result, the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends, in part, on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations
with those physicians. Physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals and, in a number of our markets, physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. They may terminate their affiliation with us at any
time. If we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards, adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged from referring patients to
our facilities and our results of operations may decline.

It may become difficult for us to attract an adequate number of
physicians to practice in certain of the non-urban communities in which our hospitals are located. Our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to attract patients
to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and
medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations.

We depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals. We compete with other
health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.

The
nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other health care providers. This shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other
medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel. In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels. To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may by
required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.

We cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff. If our general labor and related expenses increase
we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly. Our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations.

If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to
make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability.

The health care industry
is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things:

•

hospital billing practices and prices for services;

•

relationships with physicians and other referral sources;

•

adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services;

•

ownership of facilities;

•

qualifications of medical and support personnel;

•

confidentiality, maintenance and security issues associated with health-related information and patient medical records;

•

the screening, stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions;

•

licensure and accreditation of our facilities;

•

operating policies and procedures, and;

•

construction or expansion of facilities and services.

Among these laws are the False Claims Act, HIPAA, the federal anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law. These laws, and particularly the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, impact the relationships
that we may have with physicians and other referral sources. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities, including employment contracts, leases and professional service agreements. We also
provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals. The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under
the anti-kickback statute. A number of our current arrangements, including financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources, may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the anti-kickback statute. Failure to meet a safe harbor
does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti-kickback statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. We cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti-kickback
statute.



These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we don’t have the
benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation. In the future, it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or
could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that we are being
investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws (see

Item 3-Legal Proceedings

), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer
significantly. In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be. See

Item 1
Business—Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation.

If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the
anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion
of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs. The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

We may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities.

We are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits, product liability lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business. Some
of these actions may involve large claims, as well as significant defense costs. We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us. All professional and general liability insurance we
purchase is subject to policy limitations. We believe that, based on our past experience and actuarial estimates, our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals. While we continuously monitor
our coverage, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates. If such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future, or payments of claims exceed our
estimates or are not covered by our insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

We may be
subject to Governmental Investigations, Regulatory Actions and Whistleblower Lawsuits

The federal False Claims Act
permits private parties to bring

qui tam

, or whistleblower, lawsuits against companies. Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal
government. Because

qui tam

lawsuits are filed under seal, we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware.

In 2009, we agreed to settle a qui tam lawsuit relating to our South Texas Health System after many years of governmental investigations. Some of our subsidiaries operating small behavioral health care
facilities in Virginia are currently the subject of governmental investigations, and, in one case, a qui tam action in which the government intervened and is charging violations of the False Claims Act. We cannot predict whether we will be the
subject of additional investigations or whistleblower lawsuits. Any determination that we have violated applicable laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us.

If any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation,
such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid.

The construction and
operation of health care facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, fire prevention, rate-setting
and compliance with building codes and environmental protection. Additionally, such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards.

All of our hospitals are accredited, meaning that they are properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified
under the Medicare program. The effect of maintaining accredited facilities is to allow



such facilities to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We believe that all of our health care facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local and other
relevant regulations and standards. However, should any of our health care facilities lose their accredited status and thereby lose certification under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from
either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected.

Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital (“Two
Rivers”), a behavioral health facility operated by one of our subsidiaries, received a notice of termination of its Medicare/Medicaid Certification as a result of Two Rivers’ alleged failure to correct certain deficiencies which make it
ineligible for Medicare program participation. We are attempting to resolve these issues amicably with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) in an effort to prevent the termination from going into effect. In the interim,
Two Rivers has filed an administrative appeal with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Departmental Appeals Board, Civil Remedies Division, seeking review of that decision. In order to prevent CMS from terminating the facility from the
program prior to a hearing in the administrative appeal, Two Rivers has filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against CMS’ proceeding
with the termination. By agreement, the court has issued a temporary restraining order preventing CMS from terminating Two Rivers from the Medicare/Medicaid program until such time that a settlement has been reached with CMS or a preliminary
injunction has been ruled upon by the court. In the event that a settlement is not reached or a preliminary injunction is not issued, the termination could go into effect, pending resolution of the administrative appeal. We can provide no assurance
that Two Rivers will not ultimately lose its Medicare Certification and any such termination would have a material adverse effect on the facility’s future results of operations and financial condition. The operating results of Two Rivers did
not have a material impact on our 2009 consolidated results of operations.

During the third quarter of 2009, Southwest
Healthcare System (“SWHCS”), which operates Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Regional Medical Center in Riverside County, California, entered into an agreement with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(“CMS”). The agreement required SWHCS to engage an independent quality monitor to assist SWHCS in meeting all CMS’ conditions of participation. Further, the agreement provided that, during the last 60 days of the agreement, CMS would
conduct a full Medicare certification survey. That survey took place the week of January 11, 2010. At present, we have not been advised of the results from CMS. While we believe that SWHCS has complied with all obligations under the
agreement, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of the survey or that the outcome would not have a material adverse effect on us. The operating results of SWHCS did have a material impact on our 2009 consolidated results of operations.

Our growth strategy depends on acquisitions, and we may not be able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our
target criteria. We may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from not-for-profit entities due to regulatory scrutiny.

Acquisitions of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy. We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit health care companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities. Some of our
competitors have greater resources than we do. Also, suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms.

In addition, many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that affect the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities. These laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general,
advance notification and community involvement. In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over such transactions. Although the level of government involvement varies from
state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a health care facility to a for-profit entity. The adoption of new or expanded conversion
legislation, increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals, increase our acquisition costs or
make it difficult for us to acquire hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria, any of which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations.



Further, the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of
operations, depending on various factors, including the amount paid for the acquisition, the acquired hospital’s results of operations, allocation of the purchase price, effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases.

We may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire, which could harm our results of
operations and adversely affect our growth strategy.

We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the
hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations. We may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals. Integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our
ongoing business, negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel. In addition, acquisition activity requires transitions from, and the integration of, operations and, usually, information systems that are used by
acquired hospitals. In addition, some of the hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition. If we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire,
operate such hospitals profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals, our results of operations could be harmed.

If we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities, we could become liable for material obligations.

Hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including but not limited to, liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Although we typically attempt to
exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for
the past activities of hospitals we acquire. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs and/or resulting damage to a facility’s reputation could harm our business.

State efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand.

Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted CON laws as a condition prior to hospital capital
expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services. Our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition, expansion or replacement, make a
facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, result in the revocation of a facility’s license or impose civil or criminal penalties on us, any of which could harm our business.

In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and
provide exemptions of various services from review requirements. In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.

Controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues.

Controls imposed by third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as “utilization
review,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and
occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts
to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. Although we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.



Fluctuations in our operating results, quarter to quarter earnings and other factors
may result in decreases in the price of our common stock.

The stock markets have experienced volatility that has often
been unrelated to operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and, as a result, there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock. If we are unable to
operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future, the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when if becomes apparent
that the market expectations may not be realized.

In addition to our operating results, many economic and seasonal factors
outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings. These factors include certain of the risks discussed herein, demographic changes, operating results of other
hospital companies, changes in our financial estimates or recommendations of securities analysts, speculation in the press or investment community, the possible effects of war, terrorist and other hostilities, adverse weather conditions, the level
of seasonal illnesses, managed care contract negotiations and terminations, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, or other developments affecting the health care industry.

We are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could
subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price.

As a publicly traded company, we are subject to a
significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update
this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations. For example, we cannot provide assurance that,
in the future, our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We also cannot provide assurance that we
could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that
such assessment will have been fairly stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations,
we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation. If we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our stock price could decline.

Different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
condition.

Generally accepted accounting principles are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied
interpretation by us, our independent registered public accounting firm and the SEC. Such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances. Differences in interpretation of generally accepted
accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

We
continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor. Such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects.

The cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased. As we continue to invest in modern technologies, emergency rooms
and operating room expansions, the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care, we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds. In addition, we
have a commitment with an unrelated third party to build a newly constructed facility with a specified minimum number of beds and services. Although we



evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital, such returns may not be achieved if the cost
of construction continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained.

The deterioration of
credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed.

We require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation,
expansion, construction and addition of medical equipment and technology. We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We cannot predict, however, whether financing for our growth
plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed, which could harm our business.

To fund all or a portion of our future financing needs, we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate, long-term debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization
program. If any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, the degree to which we are, or in the future may become, leveraged, our ability to obtain financing could be adversely impacted
and could make us more vulnerable to competitive pressures. Our ability to meet existing and future debt obligations, depends upon our future performance and our ability to secure additional financing on satisfactory terms, each of which is subject
to financial, business and other factors that are beyond our control. Any failure by us to meet our financial obligations would harm our business.

In addition, global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding. In the event we need to access the capital markets or other
sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

We depend heavily on key management personnel and the
departure of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could harm our business.

The expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of our local hospital management personnel are critical to the success of our business. The loss of the services of one or more of our
senior executives or of a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient, quality health care services at our facilities, which could harm
our business.

The number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock is subject to potential increases or
decreases.

At December 31, 2009, 23,512,052 shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon
conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans. Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible
on a share-for-share basis into Class B Common Stock. To the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of Class B Common Stock, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock available for trading in the public market place
would increase substantially and the holders of Class B Common Stock would own a smaller percentage of that class.

In
addition, from time-to-time our Board of Directors approve stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. Such
repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock. Conversely, as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business, we may from time-to-time issue equity through the sale of stock
which would increase the number of outstanding



shares of our Class B Common Stock. Based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the market price of our stock, interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash, repurchase or
issuance of our stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings per share.

The right to
elect the majority of our Board of Directors and the majority of the general shareholder voting power resides with the holders of Class A and C Common Stock, the majority of which is owned by Alan B. Miller, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chairman of our Board of Directors.

Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, with respect to the
election of directors, holders of Class A Common Stock vote as a class with the holders of Class C Common Stock, and holders of Class B Common Stock vote as a class with holders of Class D Common Stock, with holders of all classes of our Common
Stock entitled to one vote per share.

As of March 31, 2009, the shares of Class A and Class C Common Stock
constituted 7.5% of the aggregate outstanding shares of our Common Stock and had the right to elect six members of the Board of Directors. As of March 31, 2009, the shares of Class B and Class D Common Stock (excluding shares issuable upon
exercise of options) constituted 92.5% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock and had the right to elect one member of the Board of Directors.

As to matters other than the election of directors, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that holders of Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D Common Stock all vote together as a single
class, except as otherwise provided by law.

Each share of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote;
each share of Class B Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one-tenth of a vote; each share of Class C Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to 100 votes (provided the holder of Class C Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A
Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that holder holds); and each share of Class D Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes (provided the holder of Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of
Class B Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class D Common Stock that holder holds).

In the event a
holder of Class C or Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, less than ten times the number of shares of Class C or Class D Common Stock that holder holds, then that holder will be
entitled to only one vote for every share of Class C Common Stock, or one-tenth of a vote for every share of Class D Common Stock, which that holder holds in excess of one-tenth the number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock,
respectively, held by that holder. The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory evidence that such owner holds ten times as many shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock as Class C or Class D
Common Stock, respectively, if such facts are not apparent from our stock records.

As of March 31, 2009, the shares of
Class A and Class C Common Stock constituted 7.5% of the aggregate outstanding shares of our Common Stock and constituted 87.1% of our general voting power. As of March 31, 2009, the shares of Class B and Class D Common Stock (excluding
shares issuable upon exercise of options) constituted 92.5% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock and constituted 12.9% of our general voting power.

Since a substantial majority of the Class A shares and Class C shares are controlled by Mr. Alan B. Miller and members of his family who are also directors and officers of the Company, and
they can elect a majority of the Company’s directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders, there are potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of the
Company.

In addition because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover
or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, the market price of our Class B Common Stock could be adversely affected.

We own or lease medical office buildings adjoining some of our hospitals. We believe that the
leases on the facilities, medical office buildings and other real estate leased or owned by us do not impose any material limitation on our operations. The aggregate lease payments on facilities leased by us were $41 million in 2009, $41 million in
2008 and $39 million in 2007.

ITEM 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various other litigation, as outlined
below.

Litigation and Administrative Appeal of CMS’s Attempt to Terminate Medicare Participation of Two Rivers
Psychiatric Hospital:

Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital (“Two Rivers”), a behavioral health facility operated
by one of our subsidiaries, received a notice of termination of its Medicare/Medicaid Certification as a result of Two Rivers’ alleged failure to correct certain deficiencies which make it ineligible for Medicare program participation. We are
attempting to resolve these issues amicably with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) in an effort to prevent the termination from going into effect. In the interim, Two Rivers has filed an administrative



appeal with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Departmental Appeals Board, Civil Remedies Division, seeking review of that decision. In order to prevent CMS from terminating the
facility from the program prior to a hearing in the administrative appeal, Two Rivers has filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against
CMS’ proceeding with the termination. By agreement, the court has issued a temporary restraining order preventing CMS from terminating Two Rivers from the Medicare/Medicaid program until such time that a settlement has been reached with CMS or
a preliminary injunction has been ruled upon by the court. In the event that a settlement is not reached or a preliminary injunction is not issued, the termination could go into effect, pending resolution of the administrative appeal. We can provide
no assurance that Two Rivers will not ultimately lose its Medicare Certification and any such termination would have a material adverse effect on the facility’s future results of operations and financial condition. The operating result of Two
Rivers did not have a material impact on our 2009 consolidated results of operations.

False Claims Act Case Against
Virginia Behavioral Health Facilities:

In late 2007 and again on July 3, 2008 and January 27, 2009, the Office of
Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) issued subpoenas to two of our facilities, Marion Youth Center and Mountain Youth Academy, seeking documents related to the treatment of Medicaid beneficiaries at
the facilities. It was our understanding at that time that the OIG was investigating whether claims for reimbursement submitted by those facilities to the Virginia Medicaid program were supported by adequate documentation of the services provided
which could be considered to be a basis for a false claims act violation. On August 4, 2008, the Office of the Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Virginia issued a subpoena to Keystone Newport News, another of our facilities. It was our
understanding at that time that the Office of Attorney General was investigating whether Keystone Newport News complied with various Virginia laws and regulations, including documentation requirements.

In response to these subpoenas, we produced the requested documents on a rolling basis and we cooperated with the investigations in all
respects. We also met with representatives of the OIG, the Virginia Attorney General, the United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, and the United States Department of Justice Civil Division on several occasions to discuss a
possible resolution of this matter. However, the parties were not able to reach a resolution. Consequently, on November 4, 2009, the United States Department of Justice and the Virginia Attorney General intervened in a qui tam case that had been
filed under seal in 2007 against Universal Health Services, Inc., Keystone Marion, LLC and Keystone Education and Youth Services, LLC, doing business as the Marion Youth Center. The qui tam case was brought by four former employees of the Marion
Youth Center. At this time, based upon a press release issued by the Department of Justice, the allegations being pursued by the United States and the Commonwealth of Virginia appear to relate solely to the Marion Youth Center. The United States and
the Commonwealth of Virginia now have 120 days in which to serve their complaint upon the defendants. We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Although we will
continue to work towards a settlement, there is no assurance that a settlement can be reached, and, should a settlement be reached, we are unable at this time to determine the ultimate settlement amount. If a settlement is not reached, we will
defend ourselves vigorously against these allegations. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in the litigation or that the case will be limited to the Marion Youth Center.

Ethridge v. Universal Health Services et. al:

In June, 2008, we and one of our acute care facilities, Lancaster Community Hospital, were named as defendants in a wage and hour lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court. This is a purported class
action lawsuit alleging that the hospital failed to provide sufficient meal and break periods to certain employees. We have denied liability and are defending the case vigorously which has not yet been certified as a class action by the court. We
are still uncertain as to the legal viability and extent of the claims, and, as such, are unable to determine the extent of potential financial exposure at this time.



The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among
other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government action has increased with respect to
investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers. Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from
participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a
comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result
in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, from time to time, we are subjected to inquiries or actions with
respect to our facilities. There is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed above. Even if we
were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.

In addition, various
suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.



PART II

ITEM 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our Class B Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of our Class A, Class C and Class D Common Stock are not
traded in any public market, but are each convertible into shares of our Class B Common Stock on a share-for-share basis. In November, 2009, we declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend which was paid on
December 15, 2009 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2009. All classes of common stock participated on a pro rata basis and, as required, all references to share quantities and share prices for all periods presented have been
adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.

ITEM 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Our principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers. As of February 25, 2010, we owned
and/or operated or had under construction, 25 acute care hospitals (excluding 1 new replacement facility currently being constructed) and 102 behavioral health centers located in 32 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. As part of our ambulatory
treatment centers division, we manage and/or own outright or in partnerships with physicians, 7 surgical hospitals and surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 5 states and Puerto Rico.

Net revenues from our acute care hospitals, surgical hospitals, surgery centers and radiation oncology centers accounted for 74% of our
consolidated net revenues in each of 2009, 2008 and 2007. Net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities accounted for 25% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2009, 2008 and 2007. Approximately 1% in each of 2009, 2008 and 2007
of our consolidated net revenues were recorded in connection with two construction management contracts pursuant to the terms of which we built newly constructed acute care hospitals for an unrelated third party.

Services provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology,
oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and behavioral health services. We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information
services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors

This Annual Report
contains “forward-looking statements” that reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, the
information concerning our possible future results of operations, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expectations that regulatory developments or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial

condition or results of operations;



•

possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government programs, including Medicare
or Medicaid;

•

an increase in the number of uninsured and self-pay patients treated at our acute care facilities that unfavorably impacts our ability to
satisfactorily and timely collect our self-pay patient accounts;

our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors and there can be no assurance that failure of the payors
to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;

•

the ability to obtain adequate levels of general and professional liability insurance on current terms;

•

changes in our business strategies or development plans;

•

fluctuations in the value of our common stock, and;

other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

During the third quarter of 2009, Southwest Healthcare System (“SWHCS”), which operates Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland
Valley Regional Medical Center in Riverside County, California, entered into an agreement with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The agreement required SWHCS to engage an independent quality monitor to assist SWHCS in
meeting all CMS’ conditions of participation. Further, the agreement provided that, during the last 60 days of the agreement, CMS would conduct a full Medicare certification survey. That survey took place the week of January 11,
2010. At present, we have not been advised of the results from CMS. While we believe that SWHCS has complied with all obligations under the agreement, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of the survey or that the outcome would not have
a material adverse effect on us. The operating results of SWHCS did have a material impact on our 2009 consolidated results of operations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

A summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in Note 1 to the financial statements. We consider our critical
accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements, including the following:

Revenue recognition:

We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided. Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 38%, 38% and 39% of
our net patient revenues during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 46%, 46% and 44% of our net patient revenues
during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from
patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered. We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates. Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates
per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. We closely monitor our
historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available. However, due to the complexities involved in these
estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.

We estimate our Medicare
and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations. The laws and regulations governing the
Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term. Certain types of payments by the
Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative
review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements. Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to
legislative and regulatory changes. As such, we can not provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Adjustments related to the final
settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2009, 2008 or 2007. If it were to occur, each 1% adjustment to our estimated net Medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and
settlement as of December 31, 2009, would change our after-tax net income by approximately $1 million.

We provide care
to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to



qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net. Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at
established rates, amounting to (amounts include uninsured discounts mentioned above and data related to an acute care facility that is reflected as discontinued operations) $671 million, $609 million and $561 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

At our acute care facilities, Medicaid pending accounts comprise the large majority of our receivables that are
pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states. Approximately 5% or $35 million as of December 31, 2009 and 5% or $36 million as
of December 31, 2008 of our accounts receivable, net, were comprised of Medicaid pending accounts.

Our patient
registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient’s responsible party at the time of registration. At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned. There are various
pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered. Certain patients may be classified as
Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible. When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending, our patient accounting
system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates pending ultimate disposition of the patient’s Medicaid eligibility.

Based on historical hindsight information related to Medicaid pending accounts, we estimate that approximately 56% or $20 million of the $35
million Medicaid pending accounts receivable as of December 31, 2009 will subsequently qualify for Medicaid reimbursement. Approximately 60% or $21 million of $36 million total Medicaid pending accounts receivable as of December 31, 2008
subsequently qualified for Medicaid pending reimbursement and were therefore appropriately classified at the patient’s registration. Additional charity reserves of $16 million during 2009 and $13 million during 2008 were established to cover
the Medicaid Pending patients that failed to qualify for the Medicaid program based on historical conversion rates. Based on general factors as discussed below in

Provision for Doubtful Accounts

, our facilities make estimates at each
financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible. Such estimated uncollectible amounts related to Medicaid pending, as well as other accounts receivable payer classifications, are considered when the overall
individual facility and company-wide reserves are developed.

Below are the Medicaid pending receivable agings as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008 (amounts in thousands):

Provision for Doubtful
Accounts:

Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which
is the patient’s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles. We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience. We
routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted. At our acute
care hospitals, third



party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account. For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or
accounts for uninsured patients, the patient is sent a series of statements and collection letters. Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of assistance including our charity care policy. If the patient is
deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort. Our accounts receivable are recorded net of established charity care reserves of $61 million as of
December 31, 2009 and $83 million as of December 31, 2008. The decrease in the charity care reserves resulted primarily from write-offs during 2009 of fully reserved receivables related to undocumented aliens in our south Texas market due
to a lack of funding pursuant to the Section 1011 Program.

Uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients
are extended an uninsured discount of at least 20% of total charges. During the collection process the hospital establishes a partial reserve in the allowance for doubtful accounts for self-pay balances outstanding for greater than 60 days from the
date of discharge. All self-pay accounts at the hospital level are fully reserved if they have been outstanding for greater than 90 days from the date of discharge. Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful
accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge. Potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay.

On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides
adequate coverage based on historical collection experience. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $169 million and $163 million, respectively.

Approximately 94% during 2009 and 93% during each of 2008 and 2007, of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts, was incurred by our
acute care hospitals. Shown below is our payer mix concentrations and related aging of our billed accounts receivable, net of contractual allowances, for our acute care hospitals as of December 31, 2009 and 2008:

As of December 31, 2009:

As of December 31, 2008:

Self-Insured Risks:

We provide for
self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers’ compensation claims, based on estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported. Estimated losses from asserted and
incurred but not reported claims are accrued based



on our estimates of the ultimate costs of the claims, which includes costs associated with litigating or settling claims, and the relationship of past reported incidents to eventual claims
payments. All relevant information, including our own historical experience, the nature and extent of existing asserted claims and reported incidents, is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. We also consider amounts that may be
recovered from excess insurance carriers, state guaranty funds and other sources in estimating our ultimate net liability for such risk. Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes
are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.

During the second quarter of 2009, based upon a
reserve analysis, we recorded a $23 million reduction to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves relating to years prior to 2009. This favorable change in our estimated future claims payments, which was included in our
financial results for the year ended December 31, 2009, was partially due to the favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate as well as a decrease in claims related to certain higher
risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last few years.

For the years of 1998 through 2001, most of our subsidiaries were covered under commercial insurance policies with PHICO, a Pennsylvania based insurance company that was placed into liquidation in
February, 2002. As a result, although PHICO continued to be liable for claims on our behalf that were related to 1998 through 2001, we began paying the claims upon PHICO’s liquidation. Since that time, although we preserved our right to receive
reimbursement from the PHICO estate, we were not previously able to assess the probability of collection or reasonably quantify our share of the liquidation proceeds. In January, 2009, a court order from the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania was
executed in connection with the partial liquidation of the PHICO estate. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2008, based upon our share of the undisputed and resolved claims made against the PHICO estate as of a specified date and as approved
by the liquidator to the court, we recorded a $10 million reduction to our professional and general liability self-insured claims expense. These liquidation proceeds were received during the first quarter of 2009. There were no other adjustments to
our prior year reserves for professional and general liability self-insured claims.

During the second quarter of 2007, based
upon the results of a reserve analysis, we recorded an $18 million reduction to our prior year reserves for professional and general liability self-insured claims. This favorable change in our estimated future claims payments was partially due
to the favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate as well as a decrease in obstetrical-related claims due to a company-wide patient safety initiative in this high-risk specialty.

Based upon the results of workers’ compensation reserves analyses, we recorded reductions to our prior year reserves for
workers’ compensation claims amounting to $7 million during 2009 (recorded during the fourth quarter of 2009), $4 million during 2008 (recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008) and $5 million during 2007 ($2 million recorded during the second
quarter of 2007 and $3 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2007).

Although we are unable to predict whether or not
our future financial statements will include adjustments to our prior year reserves for self-insured general and professional and workers’ compensation claims, given the relatively unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the
factors impacting these reserves, it is reasonably likely that our future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves.



Below is a schedule showing the changes in our general and professional liability and
workers’ compensation reserves during the three years ended December 31, 2009 (amount in thousands):

(a)

Net of expected recoveries from various state guaranty funds in connection with a commercial general and professional insurance company’s (PHICO) liquidation in
2002 (see

Professional and General Liability Claims and Property Insurance

).

(b)

Excludes the impact of the $10 million recovery from the liquidation of the PHICO estate, as discussed above.

In addition, we also maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims. The ultimate costs related
to these programs include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.

Long-Lived Assets:

We review our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash
flow. If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash
flows using appropriate discount rates.

Goodwill:

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the
reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit. We have
designated September 1

st

as our annual impairment
assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2009 which indicated no impairment of goodwill. Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value
projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill.

Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts
in the financial statements. We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.

The effective tax rate, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income from continuing operations before income taxes,
was 35.9% during 2009, 34.6% during 2008 and 32.8% during 2007. The effective tax rate, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income from continuing operations before income taxes, minus income from continuing
operations attributable to noncontrolling interests, was 39.6% during 2009, 39.0% during 2008 and 38.0% during 2007. The increases in



the effective tax rates during the 2009, as compared to 2008, consisted primarily of the $4.3 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded during the second quarter of 2009 resulting from the
nondeductible portion of the South Texas Health System affiliates reserve. The increase in the effective tax rates during 2008, as compared to 2007, resulted primarily from an increase in the effective state income tax rate.

We adopted the provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes effective January 1, 2007. As of January 1, 2008, our
unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $2.4 million. During 2009 and 2008, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were increased in the amount of approximately $2.0 million and $2.4
million, respectively, due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years. Also during 2008, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were reduced due to the lapse of the statute of
limitations resulting in a net income tax benefit of approximately $1 million. The balance at December 31, 2009 and 2008, if subsequently recognized, that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes is
approximately $4 million and $2 million, respectively.

We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws. We are
subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities. Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) through the year ended December 31, 2002. The IRS has commenced an audit for the tax year ended
December 31, 2006. We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.

Results of Operations

The following table summarizes our results of operations, and is used in the discussion below, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (dollar amounts in thousands):



Year Ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the Year Ended December 31,
2008:

Net revenues increased 4% or $180 million to $5.20 billion during 2009 as compared to $5.02 billion during 2008. The increase was attributable to:

•

a $182 million or 4% increase in net revenues generated at our acute care hospitals and behavioral health care facilities owned during both periods
(which we refer to as “same facility”);

•

$22 million of combined increases due primarily to the revenues generated at behavioral health facilities acquired or opened during 2009 and 2008, and;

•

$24 million of other combined net decreases in revenues resulting primarily from decreased revenue earned during 2009 in connection with construction
management contracts pursuant to the terms of which we built two newly constructed acute care hospitals for an unrelated third party.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes (and before income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $118 million to $475 million during 2009 as compared to $357 million during
2008 due to the following:

•

an increase of $52 million at our acute care facilities, as discussed below in

Acute Care Hospital Services,

exclusive of: (i) the
favorable effect of the $26 million reduction recorded during 2009 (the amount attributable to our acute care hospitals) to our professional and general liability and workers’ compensation self insurance reserves relating to years prior to
2009, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

, and; (ii) the $25 million provision for settlement recorded during 2008 in connection with the investigation of our South Texas Health System affiliates (which was settled during 2009);

•

an increase of $33 million at our behavioral health care facilities as discussed below in

Behavioral Health Services

exclusive of: (i) the
favorable effect of the $4 million reduction recorded during 2009 (the amount attributable to our behavioral health facilities) to our professional and general liability and workers’ compensation self-insurance reserves relating to years prior
to 2009, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

;

•

an increase of $30 million resulting from the reduction recorded during 2009 to our professional and general liability and workers’ compensation
self insurance reserves relating to years prior to 2009, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks;

•

a favorable change of $25 million resulting from the provision for settlement recorded during 2008 to establish a reserve in connection with the
government’s investigation of our South Texas Health System affiliates which was settled during 2009;

•

an unfavorable change of $10 million resulting from the reduction to our professional and general liability expense recorded during 2008 in connection
with the liquidation proceeds received from the PHICO estate, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

;

•

a decrease of $12 million from other combined net unfavorable changes.

Net income attributable to UHS increased $61 million to $260 million during 2009 as compared to $199 million during 2008 due to the
following:

•

the $118 million increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes, as discussed above;

•

an unfavorable change of $3 million in the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests;

•

an unfavorable change of $47 million in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from the tax provision on the net increase of $115 million
in income from continuing operations before income taxes, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Also contributing to the increase in the income tax provision was a $4 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded during 2009 in
connection with the settlement of the government’s investigation of our South Texas Health System affiliates, and;



•

an unfavorable change of $7 million resulting primarily from the after-tax gain realized during 2008 on the sale of an acute care hospital.

Year Ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007:

Net
revenues increased 7% or $339 million to $5.02 billion during 2008 as compared to $4.68 billion during 2007. The increase was attributable to:

•

a $250 million or 6% increase in net revenues generated at our acute care hospitals and behavioral health care facilities, on a same facility basis;

•

$114 million of other combined increases in revenues including revenues generated at Centennial Hills Hospital Medical Center which opened during the
first quarter of 2008 and behavioral health care facilities opened or acquired during 2008 and 2007, and;

•

$25 million of other combined net decreases in revenues resulting primarily from decreased revenue earned during 2008 in connection with construction
management contracts pursuant to the terms of which we built two newly constructed acute care hospitals for an unrelated third party.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes (and before income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $38 million to $357 million during 2008 as compared to $319 million during 2007
due to the following:

•

an increase of $54 million at our acute care facilities as discussed below in

Acute Care Hospital Services

exclusive of the $25 million
unfavorable pre-tax provision for settlement recorded during 2008 in connection with the investigation of our South Texas Health System affiliates and exclusive of the $16 million favorable pre-tax effect recorded during 2007 from the reduction to
our prior year reserves for professional and general liability claims, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

;

•

an increase of $28 million at our behavioral health care facilities as discussed below in

Behavioral Health Services

exclusive of the $2 million
favorable pre-tax effect recorded during 2007 from the reduction to our prior year reserves for professional and general liability self-insured claims, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

;

•

a decrease of $25 million resulting from the provision for settlement recorded during 2008 to establish a reserve in connection with the
government’s investigation of our South Texas Health System affiliates;

•

an increase of $10 million resulting from the reduction to our professional and general liability expense recorded during 2008 in connection with the
expected receipt of liquidation proceeds from the PHICO estate, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

;

•

a decrease of $18 million resulting from favorable pre-tax effect recorded during 2007 from the reduction to our prior year reserves for professional
and general liability self-insured claims, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks,

and;

•

a decrease of $11 million from other combined net unfavorable changes.

Net income attributable to UHS increased $29 million to $199 million during 2008 as compared to $170 million during 2007 due to the
following:

•

the $38 million increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes, as discussed above;

•

a favorable change of $3 million in the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests;

•

an unfavorable change of $19 million in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from the tax provision on the net increase of $41 million in
income before income taxes, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Contributing to the increase in the income tax provision was an increase in the effective state income tax rate during 2008, as compared to 2007, and;

•

an increase of $7 million due primarily to the after-tax gain realized during 2008 on the sale of a 125-bed acute care hospital located in
Pennsylvania.



Acute Care Hospital Services

Year Ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008:

The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities on a same facility basis and is used in the
discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in thousands):

On a same facility basis during 2009, as compared to 2008, net revenues at our acute care hospitals
increased $134 million or 4%. Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased $47 million or 15% to $360 million or 9.5% of net revenues during 2009 as compared to $313 million or 8.5% of net revenues during 2008.

Inpatient admissions to these facilities increased 0.6% during 2009, as compared to 2008, while patient days decreased 1.4%. Adjusted
admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased 2.2% and adjusted patient days increased 0.1% during 2009, as compared to 2008. The average length of patient stay at these facilities was 4.4 days during 2009 as compared to 4.5 days during
2008. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 62% during 2009 and 63% during 2008.

Our same facility net revenues were favorably impacted by an increase in prices charged to private payors including health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations. On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted
admission (adjusted for outpatient activity) at these facilities increased 1.4% during 2009, as compared to 2008, and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 3.5% during 2009, as compared to 2008.

In addition to the increase in net revenues, the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes generated by our acute
care facilities during 2009, as compared to 2008, was due primarily to, as a percentage of net revenues:

•

a decrease in salaries, wages and benefits expense (to 37.7% of net revenues during 2009 as compared to 38.3% during 2008) due primarily to a
moderation of increases to salaries and wages due to the increased unemployment rates and general economic conditions as well as staff reductions at certain of our facilities due to decreased patient volumes;

•

a decrease in supplies expense (to 16.2% during 2009 as compared to 16.7% during 2008) due primarily to the cost savings realized from a new group
purchasing agreement that commenced in April, 2008, and;



•

a decrease in other operating expenses (to 18.3% during 2009 as compared to 18.6% during 2008) due primarily to cost-reducing initiatives undertaken at
our facilities as well as the impact of the disinflationary economy which has limited our vendors’ and service providers’ ability to increase their prices.

We continue to experience an increase in uninsured patients throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals which in part, has resulted
from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do not have health insurance. We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net. Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at
established rates, amounting to (includes data for an acute care facility reflected as discontinued operations) $671 million during 2009 and $609 million during 2008. An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting
adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided, could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.

The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our acute care operations during 2009 and 2008. Included in these results, in addition to the same facility results shown above, is:
(i) the favorable effect of $26 million recorded during 2009 resulting from the reduction to our professional and general liability and workers’ compensation self insurance reserves relating to years prior to 2009, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks,

and; (ii) the unfavorable effect resulting from the $25 million provision for settlement recorded during 2008 to establish a reserve in connection with the government’s investigation of our South Texas Health
System affiliates which was settled during 2009 (amounts in thousands):

During 2009, as compared to 2008, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased 4% or $140 million to
$3.81 billion. The increase in net revenues was attributable to:

•

a $134 million increase at same facility revenues, as discussed above, and;

•

a net increase of $6 million resulting from other combined revenue changes.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased $103 million to $386 million or 10.1% of net revenues during 2009 as
compared to $283 million or 7.7% of net revenues during 2008. The increase in income before income taxes at our acute care facilities resulted from:

•

a $47 million increase at our acute care facilities on a same facility basis, as discussed above;



•

an increase of $26 million resulting from the reduction recorded during 2009 to our professional and general liability and workers’ compensation
self-insurance reserves relating to years prior to 2009, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

;

•

a favorable change of $25 million resulting from the provision for settlement recorded during 2008 to establish a reserve in connection with the
government’s investigation of our South Texas Health System affiliates which was settled during 2009;

•

$5 million of other combined net increases.

Year Ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007:

The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities on a same facility basis and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007
(dollar amounts in thousands):

On a same facility basis during 2008, as compared to 2007, net revenues at our acute care hospitals
increased $163 million or 5%. Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased $52 million or 19% to $321 million or 9.0% of net revenues during 2008 as compared to $270 million or 7.9% of net revenues during 2007.

Inpatient admissions to these facilities increased 0.1% during 2008, as compared to 2007, while patient days increased 0.8%. The average
length of patient stay at these facilities was 4.5 days in each of the years 2008 and 2007. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 64% during 2008 and 63% during 2007. Our same facility inpatient volumes
were negatively impacted during 2008, as compared to 2007, by the: (i) opening of the previously disclosed, newly constructed capacity at the physician-owned competitor hospital in McAllen, Texas, and; (ii) the opening of our newly
constructed Centennial Hills Hospital Medical Center (“Centennial Hills”). Since Centennial Hills is a newly opened facility, it was not included in our same facility basis results during 2008. However, we believe a portion of the patient
volume at Centennial Hills during 2008 would have been treated at our previously existing hospitals in the Las Vegas, Nevada market which are included in our same facility basis results.

Our same facility net revenues were favorably impacted by an increase in prices charged to private payors including health maintenance
organizations and preferred provider organizations. On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities increased 4.8% during 2008, as compared to 2007, and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 4.1% during
2008, as compared to 2007.



Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at
established rates, amounting to (includes data for an acute care facility reflected as discontinued operations) $609 million during 2008 and $561 million during 2007.

The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our acute care operations during 2008 and 2007. Included in these results, in addition to the same facility results shown above, are:
(i) the 2008 financial results for Centennial Hills located in Las Vegas, Nevada which was opened during the first quarter of 2008; (ii) the unfavorable impact resulting from the $25 million provision for settlement recorded during 2008 to
establish a reserve in connection with the government’s investigation of our South Texas Health System affiliates which was settled during 2009, and; (ii) the favorable effect recorded during 2007 from the reduction to our prior year
reserves for professional and general liability self-insured claims, as mentioned above in

Self-Insured Risks

(amounts in thousands):

During 2008, as compared to 2007, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased 8% or $259 million to
$3.67 billion. The increase in net revenues was attributable to:

•

a $163 million increase at same facility revenues, as discussed above;

•

$93 million of revenues generated at Centennial Hills, and;

•

a net increase of $3 million resulting from other combined revenue changes.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased $13 million to $283 million or 7.7% of net revenues during 2008 as compared
to $270 million or 7.9% of net revenues during 2007. The increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes at our acute care facilities resulted from:

•

a $52 million increase at our acute care facilities on a same facility basis, as discussed above;

•

a decrease of $25 million resulting from the provision for settlement recorded during 2008 to establish a reserve in connection with the
government’s investigation of our South Texas Health System affiliates which was settled during 2009;

•

a decrease of $16 million resulting from the favorable pre-tax effect recorded during 2007 to our prior year reserves for professional and general
liability self-insured claims attributable to our acute care facilities, as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks,

and;

•

$2 million of other combined net increases.

acquired and recently opened facilities), increased 5% or $64 million to $1.32 billion during 2009 as compared to $1.25 billion during 2008. The increase in net revenues was attributable to:

•

a $48 million increase in same facility revenues, as discussed above, and;

•

a $16 million net increase resulting primarily from revenues generated at facilities recently acquired or opened.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased $37 million or 15% to $282 million or 21.4% of net revenues during 2009, as
compared to $245 million or 19.5% of net revenues during 2008. The increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes at our behavioral health facilities was attributable to:

•

a $33 million increase at our behavioral health facilities on a same facility basis, as discussed above, and;

•

an increase of $4 million resulting from the reduction recorded during 2009 to our professional and general liability and workers’ compensation
self-insurance reserves relating to years prior to 2009, as discussed above in

and;

•

a $2 million increase resulting other combined net favorable changes.

Sources of Revenue

Overview:

We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their
respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the
medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services. Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient
routine services vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are
beyond our control. The percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be



provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive
outpatient basis. We believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future
revenues.

Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed
for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage. The amount of such
exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year. Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than
from governmental or business payers and we continue to experience an increase in uninsured and self-pay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts thereby increasing our provision for doubtful accounts and charity
care provided.

Since a significant portion of our revenues are derived from facilities located in Nevada and Texas, we are
particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in those states. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a
disproportionate effect on our overall business results.

The following tables show the approximate percentages of net patient
revenue during the past three years (excludes sources of revenues for all periods presented for divested facilities which are reflected as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements) for: (i) our Acute Care and Behavioral
Health Care Facilities Combined; (ii) our Acute Care Facilities, and; (iii) our Behavioral Health Care Facilities. Net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts from
established billing rates, which we derived from various sources of payment for the years indicated.



Medicare:

Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance
benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate
governmental authorities. Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the
Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.

Under the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”). Under the IPPS, hospitals are
paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge. The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient’s Medicare severity diagnosis related group (“MS-DRG”). Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the
estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis. The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in
providing care. This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG. The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which
a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity. While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for
an “outlier” payment if a particular patient’s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold.

MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the “hospital market basket index,”
gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services
purchased by hospitals.

In July, 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) published the final
IPPS 2009 payment rule which provided for a 3.6% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates were considered, our overall increase from
the final rule in federal fiscal year 2009 was 4.2%.

In July, 2009, CMS published the final IPPS 2010 payment rule which
provided for a 2.1% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates and the documenting and coding adjustments are considered, we estimate
our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2010 rule will approximate 1.1%.

In September, 2007, the “TMA,
Abstinence Education, and QI Programs Extension Act of 2007” legislation took effect and scaled back cuts in hospital reimbursement that CMS was set to impose under the final rule for the IPPS for federal fiscal year 2008. CMS planned on
reducing the standardized amount by 1.2% in 2008 and 1.8% in 2009 to account for expected changes in coding practices by hospitals in response to the CMS



implementation of the new MS-DRG system for inpatient hospitals. The new law cuts these reductions by 0.6% in 2008 and 0.9% in 2009. In federal fiscal years 2010 to 2012, the new law also
requires CMS to make an adjustment to the Medicare standardized amount in these years to reflect the removal of actual aggregate payment increases or decreases for documentation and coding adjustments that occurred during federal fiscal years 2008
and 2009 as compared to the initial CMS estimates of the MS-DRG coding and documentation change impact of 0.6% and 0.9%, respectively. In federal fiscal year 2010, CMS made its initial statutory mandated adjustment under this legislation and will
continue to do so in subsequent fiscal years to ensure the implementation of MS-DRGs was budget neutral among all affected hospitals. We are unable to predict the impact of this CMS adjustment on the revenues and operating results of our acute care
hospitals but we do expect the adjustment to result in decreases to future Medicare standardized amounts.

Psychiatric
hospitals had traditionally been excluded from the IPPS. However, on January 1, 2005, CMS implemented a new PPS (“Psych PPS”) for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program. This system replaced
the cost-based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem Psych PPS with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics. The Psych PPS also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric
hospital’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. According to the May, 2008 CMS notice, the market basket increase was 3.2% for the period of July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009. In addition, according to
the May, 2009 CMS notice, the market basket increase is 2.1% for the period of July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010.

In October 2009, CMS published its annual final Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“OPPS”) rule for 2010. The final market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.1%. When other statutorily required adjustments are
considered the overall Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2010 is estimated to be 1.9%.

In December 2009, the Department of
Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published a proposed regulation and an interim final rule implementing the health information technology (“HIT”) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the
“HITECH Act”). The proposed regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The interim final
rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria.

The implementation period for these new Medicare and
Medicaid incentive payments starts in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary and
we are unable to predict which states will chose to participate. We estimate that approximately 75% of the projected incentive payments will be paid by Medicare and 25% from state Medicaid programs. Our acute care hospitals may qualify for
these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the “meaningful use criteria”. These Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments are intended to offset a portion of the cost incurred to qualify as a
meaningful user of EHR. Our acute care facilities are scheduled to implement an EHR application, on a facility-by-facility basis, beginning in late 2011 and ending in late 2014. However, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for
these incentive payments and, should we qualify, we are unable to quantify the amount of incentive payments we may receive since the amounts is dependent upon various factors including the implementation timing at each facility. Should we qualify
for incentive payments, there may be timing differences in the recognition of the revenues and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the EHR application which may cause material period-to-period changes in our future results of
operations. Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the IPPS standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. Although we believe that our acute care hospitals
will be in compliance with the EHR standards by 2015, there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the HITECH Act.



Medicaid:

Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program
that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals.
Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our
revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid. All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate
governmental authorities.

We receive a large concentration of our Medicaid revenues from Texas and significant amounts from
Nevada, Florida, California, Washington, D.C. and Illinois. The majority of these states, as well as most other states in which we operate, have reported significant budget deficits that have resulted in the reduction of Medicaid funding for 2009
and 2010. We can provide no assurance that reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Furthermore, many states are currently working to
effectuate further significant reductions in the level of Medicaid funding due to significant state budget deficits also projected for 2010, which could adversely affect future levels of Medicaid reimbursement received by our hospitals. Conversely,
on February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was signed into law and contained various Medicaid provisions that will impact our hospitals including the following: (i) temporary increases to Medicaid funding
through enhanced federal matching assistance percentages (“FMAPs”) for a 27 month period retroactive to October 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010 with all states receiving a FMAP increase of 6.2% and also receiving a bonus FMAP
increase contingent on the increased level of a state’s unemployment rate; (ii) a temporary increase of 2.5% in the federal Medicaid disproportionate share hospital allotment for both federal fiscal years 2009 and 2010, and;
(iii) states will be required to maintain effort on Medicaid eligibility consistent with requirements prior to passage of this law. Due to the indirect nature of the enhanced Medicaid federal funding contained within the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009, we are unable to determine the impact of these Medicaid changes on our future results of operations.

Certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas (Hildalgo, Maverick, Potter and Webb) participate in CMS-approved private Medicaid supplemental payment (“UPL”) programs. These hospitals also have
affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties. Our hospitals receive both UPL payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from
third-party, affiliated hospitals. The UPL payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer (“IGT”) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer
of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals. We received $48 million during 2009, $30 million during 2008 and $23 million during 2007 of aggregate, net UPL and affiliated hospital indigent care payments. If during 2010 the hospital district
makes IGTs consistent with 2009, we believe we would be entitled to aggregate, net UPL and affiliated hospital indigent care payment revenues of approximately $39 million during 2010.

In July 2009, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (“THHSC”) issued a final rule and will rebase during state fiscal
year (“SFY”) 2010, on a statewide budget neutral basis, all acute care hospital inpatient Standard Dollar Amount (“SDA”) rates. In addition, the THHSC will also rebase all MS-DRG relative weights concurrent with this SDA rate
change. The THHSC will use SFY2008 cost report cost data for the SDA and relative weight rebasing and will only make changes on a prospective basis regardless of when the rebased SDA rates and relative weights are implemented. We expect this
rebasing to be implemented by THHSC sometime in 2010 or later. While we are unable to estimate the reimbursement impact, this change could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

In addition, we were notified on May 6, 2009 by the THHSC that the statewide new hospital rate for our hospitals located in South Texas
will be reduced. Although the definitive hospital rate has not yet been finalized, at this time, we estimate that our Texas Medicaid reimbursement will be reduced by $12 million annually,



applied retroactively to September 1, 2009. Our financial statements for the twelve month ended December 31, 2009 reflect this estimated hospital rate decrease covering the period of
September 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009. This rate change will be superseded by THHSC during SFY 2010 by the rebased SDA rates required by the July, 2009 proposed rule.

Managed Care:

A significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health
maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs. In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to
continue to grow. The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate. Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from
managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies.

Commercial Insurance:

Our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance. Private
insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital’s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy. Private
insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor.

Commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more
inpatient and outpatient services. To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers’ reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a
negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.

Other Sources:

Our hospitals provide services to
individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage. Such patients are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other
state assistance programs, as well as our local hospital’s indigent and charity care policy. Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to
settle their outstanding account balances.

State Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments:

Hospitals
that have an unusually large number of low-income patients (i.e., those with a Medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean Medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are
eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) adjustment. Congress established a national limit on DSH adjustments. Although this legislation and the resulting state broad-based provider taxes have affected the payments we
receive under the Medicaid program, to date the net impact has not been materially adverse.

Upon meeting certain conditions
and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas’ and South Carolina’s low income patients, five of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina received additional reimbursement from each state’s DSH
fund. The Texas and South Carolina programs have been renewed for each state’s 2010 fiscal years (covering the period of October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2010 for each state). Included in our financial results was an aggregate of
$56 million during 2009, $42 million during 2008 and $41 million during 2007 recorded in connection with these DSH programs. Failure to renew these DSH programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of our hospitals that currently
receive DSH payments to qualify for future DSH funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Assuming that the Texas and South Carolina programs are renewed for
each state’s 2011 fiscal years at amounts similar to the 2010 fiscal year amounts, we estimate our aggregate reimbursements pursuant to these programs to be $52 million during 2010.



In May, 2009 the THHSC completed its mid-year update to the Medicaid DSH fund which includes
a 2.5% federal stimulus update and a 1.1% consumer price index update both of which were not included in the state’s preliminary DSH payment amounts as well as additional funds being available due to certain other participating Texas hospitals
reaching their DSH fund limitation. As a result of this mid-year DSH fund update, our Medicaid DSH funding increased by $6 million during the state’s 2009 fiscal year covering the period of September 1, 2008 through August 31, 2009.

Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform:

Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many
states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed
upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, the War on Terrorism, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, the expansion of a Medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect
the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future. We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.

Healthcare reform proposals are being formulated by the legislative and executive branches of the federal government. In addition, some of the states in which we operate periodically consider various
healthcare reform proposals. We anticipate that the debate of alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies will continue and may be enacted in the future. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of these programs
and whether or when they may be enacted, we cannot predict what effect they will have on us or whether they will adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

In addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement
may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may
materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities. The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many
years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers’ rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments.
Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.

Finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls. Reductions in reimbursement
amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.

Other Operating Results

Combined net revenues from our surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers
and radiation oncology centers were $24 million during 2009, $29 million during 2008 and $34 million during 2007. In connection with construction management contracts pursuant to the terms of which we are building/have built newly constructed acute
care hospitals for an unrelated third party, we earned revenues of $42 million during 2009, $64 million during 2008 and $83 million during 2007. Combined income from continuing operations before income taxes earned in connection with the revenues
mentioned above was $13 million during 2009, $11 million during 2008 and $10 million during 2007.



Below is a schedule of our interest expense during 2009, 2008 and 2007 (amounts in
thousands):

(a.)

In June, 2008, we issued an additional $150 million of senior notes (the “Notes”) which formed a single series with the original $250 million of Notes issued
in June, 2006 (see

Note 4—Long Term Debt

). Other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to, and trade interchangeably with, the Notes which were originally
issued in June, 2006. The proceeds from this issuance were used to repay outstanding borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit agreement and accounts receivable securitization program.

As indicated above, the combined interest expense on our revolving credit agreement, demand notes, Senior Notes and accounts receivable
securitization program decreased $8 million to $47 million during 2009 as compared to $55 million during 2008. This decrease was due primarily to an $81 million decrease in the aggregate average outstanding borrowings on those debt facilities and a
0.4% decrease in the weighted average borrowing rate. During 2008, as compared to 2007, the combined interest expense on the above-mentioned debt facilities decreased $3 million to $55 million during 2008 as compared to $58 million during 2007. This
decrease was due primarily to a 0.9% decrease in the weighted average borrowing rate partially offset by an $83 million increase in the aggregate average outstanding borrowings on those debt facilities.

The effective tax rate, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income from continuing operations before income taxes,
was 35.9% during 2009, 34.6% during 2008 and 32.8% during 2007. The effective tax rate, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income from continuing operations before income taxes, minus income from continuing
operations attributable to noncontrolling interests, was 39.6% during 2009, 39.0% during 2008 and 38.0% during 2007. The increases in the effective tax rates during the 2009, as compared to 2008, consisted primarily of the $4.3 million unfavorable
discrete tax item recorded during the second quarter of 2009 resulting from the nondeductible portion of the South Texas Health System affiliates settlement. The increase in the effective tax rates during 2008, as compared to 2007, resulted
primarily from an increase in the effective state income tax rate.

Discontinued Operations

During 2008, we sold a 125-bed acute care hospital located in Pennsylvania and commenced divestiture considerations for the real property of
our four acute care facilities located in Louisiana that were severely damaged and closed during 2005 as a result of damage sustained from Hurricane Katrina. The operating results and gain on divestiture for the facility located in Pennsylvania are
reflected as “Income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2008 and 2007.



The following table shows the results of operations of these facilities, on a combined
basis, for all facilities reflected as discontinued operations (amounts in thousands):

Professional and General Liability Claims and Property Insurance

Effective January 1, 2008, most of our subsidiaries became self-insured for malpractice exposure up to $10 million per occurrence, as
compared to $20 million per occurrence in the prior year. We purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of $10 million up to $195 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. However,
we are liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.

Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents,
estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies. While
we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate. Given our significant
self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

As of December 31, 2009, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $266 million, of which $46 million is
included in other current liabilities. As of December 31, 2008, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $272 million ($271 million net of expected recoveries from state guaranty funds) of which $42 million is
included in other current liabilities. As a result of a commercial insurer’s liquidation in 2002, we became liable for unpaid claims related to our facilities, some of which remain outstanding as of December 31, 2009. The reserve for the
estimated future claims payments for these outstanding liabilities is included in the accrual for our professional and general liability claims as of December 31, 2009.

During the second quarter of 2009, based upon a reserve analysis, we recorded a $23 million reduction to our professional and general
liability self-insurance reserves relating to years prior to 2009. This favorable change in our estimated future claims payments, which was included in our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2009, was partially due to the
favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate as well as a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of a company-wide patient
safety initiative undertaken during the last few years.

Effective April 1, 2009, we have commercial property insurance
policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from windstorm damage up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence. Losses resulting from non-named windstorms are subject to a $250,000 deductible. Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject
to deductibles between 3% and 5% (based upon the location of the facility) of the declared total insurable value of the property. In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses



resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses.). Our earthquake limit is $250 million, except for facilities in Alaska,
California and the New Madrid (which includes certain counties located in Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee) and Pacific Northwest Seismic Zones which are subject to a $100 million limitation. The earthquake limit in
Puerto Rico is $25 million. Earthquake losses are subject to a $250,000 deductible for our facilities located in all states except California, Alaska, Washington, Puerto Rico and the New Madrid where earthquake losses are subject to deductibles
ranging from 1% to 5% (based upon the location of the facility) of the declared total insurable value of the property. Flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility. Due to an increase in
property losses experienced nationwide in recent years, the cost of commercial property insurance has increased. As a result, catastrophic coverage for earthquake and flood has been limited to annual aggregate losses (as opposed to per occurrence
losses). Given these insurance market conditions, there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained by us, will not have a material adverse effect on our future
results of operations.

Effects of Inflation and Seasonality

Seasonality

—Our business is typically seasonal, with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and
fourth quarters of the year. This seasonality occurs because, generally, more people become ill during the winter months, which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months.

Inflation

—Inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years. As mentioned above, as
a percentage of revenues during 2009 as compared to 2008, we experienced decreases in salaries, wages and benefits expense, supplies expense and other operating expenses due to, among other things, a moderation of increases to salaries and wages due
to the increased unemployment rates and the impact of the disinflationary economy which has limited our vendors and service providers’ ability to increase their prices.

However, since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are
supply and other costs, we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to contain future expense increases. Our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid
patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. We believe, however, that through adherence to cost containment policies, labor management and
reasonable price increases, the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable.

Liquidity

Year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008:

Net cash provided by operating activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $533 million during 2009 as compared to $494 million during 2008. The net increase of $39 million, or 8%, was primarily attributable to the following:

•

a favorable net change of $68 million due to an increase in net income, plus or minus the adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by
operating activities (depreciation and amortization, gains on sales of businesses and assets, stock-based compensation expense and provision for settlement);

•

an unfavorable change of $24 million in accounts receivable;

•

a favorable change of $50 million in construction management and other receivable which includes $10 million of cash proceeds received during the first
quarter of 2009 from the estate liquidation of a commercial insurer (related receivable was recorded during fourth quarter of 2008);



•

an unfavorable change of $23 million in other working capital accounts due primarily to the payment made to the government during 2009 to settle the
South Texas Health System affiliates investigation;

•

an unfavorable change of $22 million in other assets and deferred charges due primarily to an initial payment of $8 million made during 2009 in
connection with the purchase of a health information technology application and the receipt during 2008 of a $9 million deposit held by our pharmacy supply distributor;

•

a favorable change of $18 million in accrued and deferred income taxes;

•

an unfavorable change of $26 million in accrued insurance expense, net of commercial premium paid, resulting primarily from a $23 million reduction to
our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves and a $7 million reduction to our workers’ compensation self-insurance reserves self-insurance reserves recorded during 2009 (as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks)

, and;

•

$2 million of other combined net unfavorable changes.

Days sales outstanding (“DSO”):

Our DSO are calculated by dividing our annual net revenue by the number of days in the year. The result is divided into the accounts receivable
balance at the end of the year to obtain the DSO. Without adjustment, our DSO were 42 days in 2009, 46 days in 2008 and 48 days in 2007. After adjusting our respective 2008 and 2007 year-end accounts receivable balances for the items mentioned
below, our adjusted DSO were 44 days in 2008 and 48 days in 2007. No adjustments were required to our 2009 DSO. Our 2008 and 2007 adjusted DSO were calculated by reducing our respective year-end accounts receivable balances for the following:
(i) the PHICO liquidation and construction management receivables as of December 31, 2008, and; (ii) the construction management receivables as of December 31, 2007.

on capital expenditures, including approximately $115 million related to expenditures for capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and completion of major construction projects in progress at December 31, 2009. We
believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated funds and/or additional funds, as discussed below.



Capital Resources

Credit Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities

We have an $800 million, unsecured non-amortizing revolving credit agreement, as amended, (“Credit Agreement”) which is scheduled to expire on July 28, 2011. The Credit Agreement includes a
$100 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The interest rate on the borrowings is determined, at our option, as either: (i) the one, two, three or six month London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread of 0.33% to 0.575%;
(ii) the higher of the Agent’s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or; (iii) a competitive bid rate. A facility fee ranging from 0.07% to 0.175% is required on the total commitment. The applicable margins over LIBOR and
the facility fee are based upon our credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. At December 31, 2009, the applicable margin over the LIBOR rate was 0.50% and the facility fee was
0.125%. There are no compensating balance requirements. As of December 31, 2009, we had $329 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit agreement and $403 million of available borrowing capacity, net of $68 million of
outstanding letters of credit.

There were no borrowings outstanding under the short-term, on-demand credit facility at each
of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Outstanding borrowings pursuant to this facility, if any, which can be refinanced through available borrowings under the terms of our Credit Agreement, are classified as long-term on our balance sheet.

In August, 2007, we entered into a $200 million accounts receivable securitization program (“Securitization”) with a group of
conduit lenders and liquidity banks. The patient-related accounts receivable (“Receivables”) for substantially all of our acute care hospitals serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings. The interest rate on the borrowings is based
on the commercial paper rate plus a spread of .35%. The initial term of this Securitization was 364 days and the term can be extended for incremental 364 day periods upon mutual agreement of the parties. The facility was extended for a third 364-day
term in August, 2009 and will mature in August, 2010. We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings. We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from
certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us. The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks.
The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans. As of December 31, 2009, we had $10 million of borrowings
outstanding pursuant to this program and $190 million of available borrowing capacity. The outstanding borrowings pursuant to the Securitization program are classified as long-term on our balance sheet since they can be refinanced through available
borrowings under the terms of our Credit Agreement.

On June 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior notes (the
“Notes”) which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016. Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year. In June, 2008, we issued and additional $150 million of
Notes which formed a single series with the original Notes issued in June, 2006. Other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to and trade interchangeably with, the
Notes which were originally issued in June, 2006.

During 2001, we issued $200 million of senior notes which have a 6.75%
coupon rate and which mature on November 15, 2011. The interest on the senior notes is paid semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The senior notes can be redeemed in whole at any time and in part from time to
time.

The average amounts outstanding during 2009, 2008 and 2007 under the revolving credit, demand notes and accounts
receivable securitization program were $287 million, $431 million and $435 million, respectively, with corresponding effective interest rates of 1.7%, 3.9% and 6.0% including commitment and facility fees. The maximum amounts outstanding at any
month-end were $356 million in 2009, $566 million in 2008 and $531



million in 2007. The effective interest rate on our revolving credit, demand notes and accounts receivable securitization program, including the respective interest expense/income on designated
interest rate swaps, was 3.7% in 2009, 4.4% in 2008 and 5.9% in 2007.

Our revolving credit agreement includes a material
adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw. The facility also requires compliance with maximum debt to capitalization and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all required covenants as of December 31,
2009. We also believe that we would remain in compliance if the full amount of our commitment was borrowed.

The fair value of
our long-term debt at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $1.02 billion and $924 million, respectively.

Our
total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 35% at December 31, 2009 and 39% at December 31, 2008.

Our
$800 million Credit Agreement, under which we had $329 million of outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2009, matures on July 28, 2011. We also have $200 million of 6.75% senior notes which are scheduled to mature November 15, 2011.
Our refinancing plans for these two debt facilities have not yet been determined. Under current economic conditions and based on our historical and projected financial performance, as well as our current investment grade ratings, we believe we will
have sufficient access to the various capital markets to enable us to adequately replace the borrowing capacity scheduled to mature in 2011. It is likely that should current economic conditions remain the same at the time of such refinancing, the
terms and costs of such financing will be less favorable than exist currently. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance these loans at the time we choose to access the markets or the terms upon which we will be able to do so.

We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay dividends and potentially repurchase shares of our common
stock utilizing internally generated and additional funds. Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) the issuance of equity; (ii) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility or through refinancing the existing revolving
credit agreement, and/or; (iii) the issuance of other long-term debt. In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or
within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2009, we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety
bonds. Our outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of December 31, 2009 totaled $84 million consisting of: (i) $68 million related to our self-insurance programs; (ii) $15 million related primarily to pending appeals of
legal judgments (including judgments related to our self-insurance programs), and; (iii) $1 million of other debt guarantees related to public utilities and entities in which we own a minority interest.

Obligations under operating leases for real property, real property master leases and equipment amount to $122 million as of
December 31, 2009. The real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near hospital property for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income. We sublease space in these buildings and any amounts received from these subleases
are offset against the expense. In addition, we lease four hospital facilities from the Trust with terms expiring in 2011 and 2014. These leases contain up to four 5-year renewal options.



The following represents the scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations as of
December 31, 2009:

(a)

Includes capital lease obligations.

(b)

Assumes that all debt outstanding as of December 31, 2009, including borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and accounts receivable securitization program
remain outstanding until the final maturity of the debt agreements at the same interest rates which were in effect as of December 31, 2009. We have the right to repay borrowings, upon short notice and without penalty, pursuant to the terms of
the revolving credit agreement, demand note and accounts receivable securitization program.

(c)

Estimated remaining construction cost of the newly constructed Palmdale Medical Center, a 171-bed acute care hospital located in Palmdale, California. This
facility is expected to be completed and opened during the second quarter of 2010. We are required to build this hospital pursuant to an agreement with a third-party. In addition to this new hospital construction project, we had various other
projects under construction as of December 31, 2009 with estimated additional cost to complete and equip of approximately $115 million. Because we can terminate substantially all of the related construction contracts at any time without paying
a termination fee, these costs are excluded from the above table except for the amount contractually committed to a third-party.

(d)

Consists of: (i) $104 million related to a long-term contract with a third-party to provide certain data processing services and laboratory information system and
order management technology for our acute care facilities; (ii) $72 million related to the expected costs to be paid to a third-party vendor in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application
(“EHR”) for each of our acute care facilities (excludes expected internal costs to be incurred, please see

Item 7-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Medicare

for
additional disclosure); (iii) a $15 million liability for physician commitments expected to be paid in the future, and; (iv) a $1 million remaining commitment payable in connection with a portion of a gift to the College of William &
Mary from our Chief Executive Officer. See

Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional disclosure related to the physician commitment liability.

(e)

Reflects our future minimum operating lease payment obligations related to our operating lease agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2009 as discussed in Note
7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of the lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease and our future lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options.

(f)

Consists of $215 million of estimated future payments related to our non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan (estimated through 2086), as disclosed in

Note 10
to the Consolidated Financial Statements

, and $15 million of estimated future payments related to another retirement plan liability. Included in our other non-current liabilities as of December 31, 2009 was a $24 million liability recorded
in connection with the non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan and an $11 million liability recorded in connection with the other retirement plan.

As of December 31, 2009, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $266 million, of which $46 million is included in other current liabilities and $220 million is
included in other



non-current liabilities. We exclude the $266 million for professional and general liability claims from the contractual obligations table because there are no significant contractual obligations
associated with these liabilities and because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such amounts. Please see

Professional and General Liability Claims and Property Insurance

above for
additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability claims and reserves. Additionally, the table above does not include $6 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2009. Due to
the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for which the amounts may be utilized.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in domestic
interest rates, a portion of our debt is fixed rate accomplished by either borrowing on a long-term basis at fixed rates or by, from time to time, entering into interest rate swap transactions. From time to time, we may enter into interest rate swap
agreements that require us to pay fixed and receive floating interest rates or to pay floating and receive fixed interest rates over the life of the agreements. We may also, from time to time, enter into treasury locks (“T-Locks”) to
protect from a rise in the yield of the underlying treasury security for a forecasted bond issuance.

During the fourth
quarter of 2007, we entered into two interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional principal amount of $150 million and receive 3-month LIBOR. Each of the two interest rate swaps has a notional principal amount of $75 million.
The interest rate swaps mature on October 17, 2011 and October 5, 2012 and have fixed rates payable of 4.865% and 4.7625%, respectively. The notional amount of the interest rate swap maturing on October 17, 2011 reduces to $50 million
on October 18, 2010.

During the second quarter of 2006, in connection with the issuance of the $250 million of senior
notes (“Notes”) which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016, we entered into T-Locks, with an aggregate notional amount of $250 million, to lock in the 10-year treasury rate underlying the bond issuance. These T-Locks,
which were designated as cash flow hedges, were unwound during the second quarter of 2006 resulting in a $3 million cash payment to us which has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (net of income taxes) and is being amortized
over the life of the 10-year Notes.

The table below presents information about our long-term financial instruments that are
sensitive to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2009. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

Maturity Date, Fiscal Year Ending December 31

(Dollars in thousands)



As calculated based upon our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2009 that is subject to
interest rate fluctuations, each 1% change in interest rates would impact our pre-tax income by approximately $2 million.

ITEM 9A.

Controls and Procedures.

As of December 31, 2009, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), we
performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by management on a timely basis in order to comply with our disclosure obligations under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, and the SEC rules thereunder.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the fourth
quarter of 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over our financial reporting. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria on

Internal Control—Integrated Framework,

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Based on its assessment, management has concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2009, based on criteria in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework,

issued by the COSO. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears herein.

UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES, INC.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Universal Health Services, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Universal Health Services, Inc. at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, financial statement schedule, and for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included under Item 9A as

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it
accounts for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2007. As discussed in Note 1, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for noncontrolling interests in 2009.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1) BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Services provided by our hospitals, all of which are operated by subsidiaries of ours include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology,
diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and behavioral health services. We, through our subsidiaries, provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central
purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.

The more significant accounting policies follow:

A) Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships controlled by us or our subsidiaries as the
managing general partner. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

B) Revenue
Recognition:

We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided. Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 38%, 38% and 39% of our net patient revenues during 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 46%, 46% and 44% of our net patient revenues during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for
services rendered. We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates. Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted
charges and per diem payments. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in
applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available. However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different
from the amounts we estimate and record.

We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial
information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations. The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and
subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term. Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g.
Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the
final settlements. Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes. As such, we can not
provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts
did not materially impact our results in 2009, 2008 or 2007.

We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or
economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, amounting to (amounts include uninsured discounts mentioned above and data related to an acute care facility that is reflected as
discontinued operations) $671 million, $609 million and $562 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

C) Provision for Doubtful Accounts:

Collection
of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient’s
responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles. We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience. We routinely review accounts
receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted. At our acute care hospitals, third
party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account. For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient is sent a
series of statements and collection letters. Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of assistance including our charity care policy. If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad
debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort. Our accounts receivable are recorded net of established charity care reserves of $61 million as of December 31, 2009 and $83 million as of December 31,
2008. The decrease in the charity care reserves resulted primarily from write-offs during 2009 of fully reserved receivables related to undocumented aliens in our south Texas market due to a lack of funding pursuant to the Section 1011 Program.

Uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of at least 20% of total
charges. During the collection process the hospital establishes a partial reserve in the allowance for doubtful accounts for self-pay balances outstanding for greater than 60 days from the date of discharge. All self-pay accounts at the hospital
level are fully reserved if they have been outstanding for greater than 90 days from the date of discharge. Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of
discharge. Potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay.

On a
consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $169 million and $163 million, respectively.

D) Concentration of Revenues:

Our five majority owned acute care hospitals in the Las Vegas, Nevada market contributed, on a combined basis, 22% in 2009, 22% in 2008 and 21% in 2007, of our consolidated net revenues. On a
combined basis, our facilities in the McAllen/Edinburg, Texas market (consisting of three acute care facilities, a children’s hospital and a behavioral health facility) contributed 7% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2009, 2008
and 2007.

E) Cash and Cash Equivalents:

We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities
of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

F) Property and Equipment:

Property and equipment are stated
at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements are charged to the property accounts. Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred. We remove the cost and the
related accumulated depreciation from the accounts for assets sold or retired and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations.

We capitalize interest expense on major construction projects while in progress. We capitalized interest on major construction projects amounting to $11.6 million during 2009, $7.9 million during 2008 and
$9.2 million during 2007.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements (twenty to forty years) and equipment (three to fifteen years). Depreciation expense (excluding discontinued operations) was $184.6 million during 2009, $176.1 million during 2008 and $159.8
million during 2007.

G) Long-Lived Assets:

We review our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible
assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our
estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow. If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values are
determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.

H) Goodwill:

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on
market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit. We have designated September 1

st

as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2009 which
indicated no impairment of goodwill. There were also no goodwill impairments during 2008 or 2007. Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment
in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill.

Changes in the carrying amount of
goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2009 were as follows (in thousands):

(a)

The reduction to the Acute Care Services’ goodwill consists primarily of a reclassification to “assets of facilities held for sale” and represents the
goodwill attributable to four acute care facilities located in Louisiana that were severely damaged and closed during 2005 as a result of Hurricane Katrina. The reduction to Behavioral Health Services’ goodwill consists primarily of the
recording of net settlement proceeds received during 2008 related to a prior year acquisition.

(b)

Consists primarily of adjustments to prior year purchase price allocations.

I) Other Assets:

Other assets consist primarily of amounts related to: (i) prepaid fees for various software and other applications used by our hospitals; (ii) deposits;
(iii) investments in various businesses, including Universal Health Realty Income Trust; (iv) the invested assets related to a deferred compensation plan that is held by an independent trustee in a rabbi-trust and that has a related
payable included in other noncurrent liabilities; (v) the estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments, as discussed below, and; (vi) other miscellaneous assets. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were not material.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

J) Physician Guarantees and Commitments:

As of
December 31, 2009, our accrued liabilities-other, and our other assets include $15 million of estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments. Pursuant to contractual guarantees outstanding as of December 31,
2009 that are applicable to future years, we have $21 million of potential future financial obligations of which $14 million are potential obligations during 2010 and $7 million are potential obligations during 2011 and later.

K) Self-Insured Risks:

We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and
workers’ compensation claims, based on estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported. Estimated losses from asserted and incurred but not reported claims are accrued based on our estimates of the
ultimate costs of the claims, which includes costs associated with litigating or settling claims, and the relationship of past reported incidents to eventual claims payments. All relevant information, including our own historical experience, the
nature and extent of existing asserted claims and reported incidents, and analyses of this information, is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. We also consider amounts that may be recovered from excess insurance carriers, state
guaranty funds and other sources in estimating our ultimate net liability for such risk. Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or
as a reduction of expense. Based on the results of workers’ compensation reserves analyses, we recorded reductions of prior year reserves of $7 million during 2009, $4 million during 2008 and $5 million during 2007. See Note 8 for discussion of
revisions to prior year general and professional liability reserves.

L) Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. We believe that future income
will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.

The effective tax rate, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income from continuing operations before income taxes, was 35.9% during 2009, 34.6% during 2008 and 32.8% during 2007.
The effective tax rate, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income from continuing operations before income taxes, minus income from continuing operations attributable to non-controlling interests, was 39.6%
during 2009, 39.0% during 2008 and 38.0% during 2007. The increases in the effective tax rates during the 2009, as compared to 2008, consisted primarily of the $4.3 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded during the second quarter of 2009
resulting from the nondeductible portion of the South Texas Health System affiliates reserve. The increase in the effective tax rates during 2008, as compared to 2007, resulted primarily from an increase in the effective state income tax rate.

We adopted the provisions of the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes effective January 1, 2007. As
of January 1, 2008, our unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $2.4 million. During 2009 and 2008, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were increased in the amount of
approximately $2.0 million and $2.4 million, respectively, due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years. Also during 2008, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were reduced due
to the lapse of the statute of limitations resulting in a net income tax benefit of approximately $1 million. The balance at December 31, 2009 and 2008, if subsequently recognized, that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and the
provision for income taxes is approximately $4 million and $2 million, respectively.

We operate in multiple jurisdictions
with varying tax laws. We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities. Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) through the year ended December 31, 2002. The IRS has commenced an audit
for the tax year ended December 31, 2006. We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

M) Other Noncurrent Liabilities:

Other
noncurrent liabilities include the long-term portion of our professional and general liability, workers’ compensation reserves and pension liability.

N) Noncontrolling Interest:

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the noncontrolling interest balance of $238 million and $227 million, respectively, consists primarily of: (i) an
outside ownership interest of approximately 28% in five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada; (ii) a 20% outside ownership in an acute care facility located in Washington D.C. and; (iii) an outside ownership interest of
approximately 11% in an acute care facility located in Laredo, Texas.

In connection with the five acute care facilities
located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the outside owners have certain “put rights” that may require the respective limited liabilities companies (“LLCs”) to purchase the minority member’s interests upon the occurrence of:
(i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member’s ownership percentage is
reduced to less than certain thresholds.

O) Comprehensive Income:

Comprehensive income or loss, is comprised
of net income, changes in unrealized gains or losses on derivative financial instruments and a pension liability.

P) Accounting for Derivative Financial Investments and Hedging Activities:

We manage our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate. To manage this
risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.

We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) guidance which
requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet. For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships
between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”)
within shareholders’ equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.

We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions. Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability. For
derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm
commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item in the
income statement.

For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge’s inception and on a
regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether
they are expected to be highly effective in the future.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

Q) Stock-Based Compensation:

At December 31,
2009, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans. Pursuant to the FASB’s guidance, we expense the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation pursuant to the straight-line method over the stated
vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The expense associated with share-based
compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities. The applicable FASB guidance requires
that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized be classified as financing cash flows. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, there were no net excess tax benefits generated.

R) Earnings per Share:

Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the year. Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year adjusted to give effect to common stock equivalents.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, for the periods indicated:

S) Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The fair values of our registered debt and
investments are based on quoted market prices. The fair values of other long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are estimated by discounting cash flows using period-end interest rates and market conditions for instruments with similar
maturities and credit quality. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings approximates their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the fair
value disclosures included elsewhere in these notes to consolidated financial statements.

T) Use of
Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

U) Accounting Standards:

Accounting Standards Codification:

In June 2009, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Codification”). The Codification has become the single source for all
authoritative GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied for financial statements issued for periods ending after September 15, 2009. The Codification does not change GAAP and did not affect our results of operations or financial position.

Transfers of Financial Assets:

In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure
requirements for transfers of financial assets. This amendment requires greater transparency and additional disclosures for transfers of financial assets and the entity’s continuing involvement with them and changes the requirements for
derecognizing financial assets. In addition, this amendment eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity (“QSPE”). This amendment became effective for us on January 1, 2010. This amendment did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities:

In June 2009, the FASB also issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities (“VIE”s). The elimination of the concept of a QSPE, as discussed above, removes
the exception from applying the consolidation guidance within this amendment. This amendment requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis when determining whether or not it must consolidate a VIE. The amendment also requires an
enterprise to continuously reassess whether it must consolidate a VIE. Additionally, the amendment requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise’s involvement with VIEs and any significant change in risk exposure due to that involvement, as
well as how its involvement with VIEs impacts the enterprise’s financial statements. Finally, an enterprise will be required to disclose significant judgments and assumptions used to determine whether or not to consolidate a VIE. This amendment
became effective for us on January 1, 2010. This amendment will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Subsequent Event Disclosure:

In May 2009, the FASB issued standards related to accounting for, and disclosure of, events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are
issued or are available to be issued (referred to as subsequent events). The standards set forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for
potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. They also set forth the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements. Furthermore, the
standards identify the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. We adopted these standards during the second quarter of 2009 and evaluated subsequent events through
February 25, 2010.

Debt Securities Impairment:

In April 2009, the FASB issued standards that change the
method for determining whether an other-than-temporary impairment exists for debt securities and the amount of the impairment to be recorded in earnings. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial position or results of operations.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

In April 2009, the
FASB issued standards related to fair value disclosures in both interim as well as annual financial statements in order to provide more timely information about the effects of current market conditions on financial instruments. The carrying amount
and fair value of our long-term debt was $959 million and $1.02 billion respectively, at December 31, 2009.

Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities:

In April, 2009, the FASB issued standards related to fair value for assets or liabilities when the volume and level of activity has significantly decreased and identifying
circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. The overall objective of fair value measurement is that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. This standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities:

In June 2008, FASB
issued an amendment which clarified that all unvested share-based payment awards that contain a right to received nonforfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) participate in the undistributed earnings with common
shareholders, and therefore, the issuing entity is required to apply the two-class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that we currently use to determine earnings per share
for each class of common stock according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The adoption of this FSP on January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets:

In April 2008, the FASB issued a standard that amends the
accounting guidance to permit an entity to use its own assumptions when developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. The standard removes the requirement for an entity to consider
whether an intangible asset can be renewed without substantial cost or material modification to the existing terms and conditions and requires an entity to consider its own experience in renewing similar arrangements. This standard is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:

In March 2008, the FASB issued a standard which establishes,
among other things, enhanced disclosure requirements of an entity’s derivative instruments and hedging activities and their effects on the entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This standard is effective
prospectively for financial statements issued beginning after November 15, 2008. Our adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our results of operations.

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements:

In December 2007, the FASB issued a standard to establishe
accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that
should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. This standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and requires retroactive adoption of the
presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests, however, all other requirements of that standard shall be applied prospectively. This standard became effective for us on January 1, 2009 and it did not have a material
impact on our results of operations or financial position. In connection with the adoption of this standard, certain cash flow amounts in prior periods have been reclassified. Profit distributions to noncontrolling interests and purchase of
noncontrolling interests were reclassified to financing activities from operating and investing activities, respectively, in order to conform to the current year presentation.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

Business Combinations:

In December 2007, the FASB
issued standards related to business combinations. The standard establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed,
and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and
financial effects of the business combination. The standard applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008.
This standard became effective for us on January 1, 2009, and it did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets:

In December 2008, the FASB issued guidance on employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets. This guidance is intended to ensure that an
employer meets the objectives of the disclosures about plan assets in an employer’s defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan to provide users of financial statements with an understanding of the following: how investment allocation
decisions are made; the major categories of plan assets; the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets; the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets; and
significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. This guidance becomes effective for us on December 31, 2009. Since the guidance only requires enhanced disclosures, we have determined that its adoption did not have an impact on our
results of operations.

V) Assets held for Sale:

In August 2005, our Methodist Hospital and Lakeland Medical
Pavilion, each located in New Orleans, Louisiana, and our Chalmette Medical Center and Virtue Street Pavilion, each located in Chalmette, Louisiana, were severely damaged and closed from Hurricane Katrina. Since that time, all facilities have
remained closed and non-operational. The Chalmette Medical Center building has been razed as a result of the substantial hurricane damaged sustained. During 2008, we commenced divestiture considerations for the real property of these facilities
which are included as assets held for sale in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

2) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

Year ended December 31, 2009:

2009 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses:

During 2009, we spent $12 million on the acquisition of businesses and real property, including the following:

•

the acquisition of a 72-bed behavioral health care facility located in Louisville, Colorado, and;

•

the acquisition of the real property assets of a medical office building located on the campus of one of our acute care hospitals located in Texas.

The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their
estimated fair values as follows:

operations per basic and diluted share, net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per basic and diluted share was immaterial. Assuming the acquisition occurred on
January 1, 2008, the pro forma effect on our 2008 net revenues, income from continuing operations, income from continuing operations per basic and diluted share, net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per basic and
diluted share was immaterial.

2009 Divestitures of Assets and Businesses:

During 2009, we received $10 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:

•

the sale of the real property assets of a medical office building on the campus of a previously divested acute care facility located in Pennsylvania,
and;

•

the sale of our ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center

Year ended December 31, 2008:

2008 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses:

During 2008, we spent $23
million on the acquisition of businesses and real property, including the following:

•

the acquisition of a 76-bed behavioral health facility located in Lawrenceville, Georgia, and;

•

the acquisition of previously leased real property assets of a behavioral health facility located in Nevada.

The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows:

Goodwill of the facilities acquired during each of the last there years is computed, pursuant to the
residual method, by deducting the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities from the total purchase price. The factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill, which may also influence the purchase price, include the following for
each of the acquired facilities: (i) the historical cash flows and income levels; (ii) the reputations in their respective markets; (iii) the nature of the respective operations, and; (iv) the future cash flows and income growth
projections.

Assuming the acquisition of the behavioral health facility located in Georgia occurred on January 1, 2008,
the pro forma effect on our 2008 net revenues, income from continuing operations, income from continuing operations per basic and diluted share, net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per basic and diluted share was
immaterial. Assuming the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2007, the pro forma effect on our 2007 net revenues, income from continuing operations, income from continuing operations per basic and diluted share, net income attributable to UHS
and net income attributable to UHS per basic and diluted share was immaterial.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

Also during 2008, we spent a combined $2 million to
purchase/repurchase minority ownership interests in two outpatient surgery centers. We also received $2 million of net settlement proceeds related to a prior year acquisition.

2008 Divestiture of Assets and Businesses:

During 2008, we received $82 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:

•

the sale of the assets and operations of Central Montgomery Medical Center, a 125-bed acute care facility located in Lansdale, Pennsylvania;

•

the sale of our ownership interest in a third-party provider of supply chain services, and;

•

the sale of our ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center and certain other real property assets.

During 2008, in addition to the sale of Central Montgomery Medical Center, we commenced divestiture considerations for the real property of
our four acute care facilities located in Louisiana that were severely damaged and closed during 2005 as a result of damage sustained from Hurricane Katrina. The operating results and gain on divestiture of Central Montgomery Medical Center are
reflected as “Income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2008 and 2007. The discontinued operations were not attributable to noncontrolling interests.

The following table shows the results of operations of these facilities, on a combined basis, for all facilities reflected as discontinued
operations (amounts in thousands):

In addition, our 2008 income from continuing operations includes a combined pre-tax gain of $8 million from
the sale of our ownership interest in a third-party provider of supply chain services and the sale our ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center and certain other real property assets.

Year ended December 31, 2007:

2007 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses:

During 2007, we spent $102
million on the acquisition of businesses and real property, including the following:

•

the acquisition of certain assets of Texoma Healthcare System located in Texas, including a 153-bed acute care hospital, a 60-bed behavioral health
hospital, a 21-bed freestanding rehabilitation hospital and TexomaCare, a 34-physician group practice structured as a 501A corporation (acquired on January 1, 2007);

•

the acquisition of previously leased real property assets of a behavioral health facility located in Ohio;

•

the acquisition of a 52-bed behavioral health facility located in Delaware;



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

•

the acquisition of a 102-bed behavioral health facility located in Pennsylvania;

•

the acquisition of a 78-bed behavioral health facility located in Utah, and;

•

the non-cash acquisition of a 40% ownership interest in a limited partnership that owns a now closed surgical hospital in Laredo, Texas (we previously
owned a non-controlling, 50% ownership interest in the limited partnership) in exchange for a 10% minority ownership interest in a limited partnership that owns the real property of the closed surgical hospital as well as the real property and
operations of a 180-bed acute care facility in Laredo, Texas.

In connection with our January, 2007
acquisition of certain assets of Texoma Healthcare System located in Denison, Texas, including the 153-bed acute-care hospital, we are committed to build a 220-bed replacement facility within three years of the closing date.

The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows:

Assuming all these acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2007, our 2007 pro forma net revenues would have
been approximately $4.70 billion and the pro forma effect on our income from continuing operations, income from continuing operations per basic and diluted share, net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per basic and
diluted share was immaterial.

Also during 2007, we spent $15 million to acquire the remaining 10% minority ownership interest
in a limited liability company (“LLC”) that owns Methodist Hospital and Lakeland Medical Pavilion located in Louisiana that were severely damaged and closed as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Pursuant to the terms of the LLC agreement, the
third-party, minority member had certain “put rights” which they elected to exercise thereby requiring us to purchase their ownership interest at the minority member’s initial contribution in each facility.

2007 Divestiture of Assets:

During 2007, we received $7 million of combined cash proceeds in connection with the sale of vacant property located in Texas and Kentucky.

3) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair Value Hedges:

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we had no fair value hedges outstanding.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

Cash Flow Hedges:

Our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in domestic
interest rates, a portion of our debt is fixed rate accomplished by either borrowing on a long-term basis at fixed rates or by, from time to time, entering into interest rate swap transactions. Interest rate swap agreements require us to pay fixed
and receive floating interest rates or to pay floating and receive fixed interest rates over the life of the agreements. We may also, from time to time, enter into treasury locks (“T-Locks”) to protect from a rise in the yield of the
underlying treasury security for a forecasted bond issuance.

Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted the authoritative guidance
for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities which requires additional disclosure about a company’s derivative activities, but does not require any new accounting related to derivative activities. We have
applied the requirements of the guidance on a prospective basis. Accordingly, disclosures related to interim periods prior to the date of adoption have not been presented. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we entered into two interest rate swaps
whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional principal amount of $150 million and receive 3-month LIBOR. Each of the two interest rate swaps has a notional principal amount of $75 million. The fixed rate payable on the first interest rate swap is
4.7625% and matures on October 5, 2012. The fixed rate payable on the second interest rate swap is 4.865% and the maturity date is October, 17, 2011. The notional amount of the second interest rate swap reduces to $50 million on October 18, 2010. We
measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on quotes from banks. We consider those inputs to be “level 3” in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the
authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities. The fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $12 million at December 31, 2009 and $14 million at December 31, 2008 which are
included in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.

4) LONG-TERM DEBT

A summary of long-term debt follows:

We have an $800 million, unsecured non-amortizing revolving credit agreement, as amended, (“Credit
Agreement”) which is scheduled to expire on July 28, 2011. The Credit Agreement includes a $100 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The interest rate on the borrowings is determined, at our option, as either: (i) the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

one, two, three or six month London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread of 0.33% to 0.575%; (ii) the higher of the Agent’s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus
0.50%, or; (iii) a competitive bid rate. A facility fee ranging from 0.07% to 0.175% is required on the total commitment. The applicable margins over LIBOR and the facility fee are based upon our credit ratings from Standard &
Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. At December 31, 2009, the applicable margin over the LIBOR rate was 0.50% and the facility fee was 0.125%. There are no compensating balance requirements. As of
December 31, 2009, we had $329 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit agreement and $403 million of available borrowing capacity, net of $68 million of outstanding letters of credit.

There were no borrowings outstanding under the short-term, on-demand credit facility at each of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Outstanding
borrowings pursuant to this facility, if any, which can be refinanced through available borrowings under the terms of our Credit Agreement, are classified as long-term on our balance sheet.

In August, 2007, we entered into a $200 million accounts receivable securitization program (“Securitization”) with a group of
conduit lenders and liquidity banks. The patient-related accounts receivable (“Receivables”) for substantially all of our acute care hospitals serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings. The interest rate on the borrowings is based
on the commercial paper rate plus a spread of .35%. The initial term of this Securitization was 364 days and the term can be extended for incremental 364 day periods upon mutual agreement of the parties. The facility was extended for a third 364-day
term in August, 2009 and will mature in August, 2010. We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings. We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from
certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us. The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks.
The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans. As of December 31, 2009, we had $10 million of borrowings
outstanding pursuant to this program and $190 million of available borrowing capacity. The outstanding borrowings pursuant to the Securitization program are classified as long-term on our balance sheet since they can be refinanced through available
borrowings under the terms of our Credit Agreement.

On June 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior notes (the
“Notes”) which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016. Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year. In June, 2008, we issued and additional $150 million of
Notes which formed a single series with the original Notes issued in June, 2006. Other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to and trade interchangeably with, the
Notes which were originally issued in June, 2006.

During 2001, we issued $200 million of senior notes which have a 6.75%
coupon rate and which mature on November 15, 2011. The interest on the senior notes is paid semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The senior notes can be redeemed in whole at any time and in part from time to
time.

The average amounts outstanding during 2009, 2008 and 2007 under the revolving credit, demand notes and accounts
receivable securitization program were $287 million, $431 million and $435 million, respectively, with corresponding effective interest rates of 1.7%, 3.9% and 6.0% including commitment and facility fees. The maximum amounts outstanding at any
month-end were $356 million in 2009, $566 million in 2008 and $531 million in 2007. The effective interest rate on our revolving credit, demand notes and accounts receivable securitization program, including the respective interest expense/income on
designated interest rate swaps, was 3.7% in 2009, 4.4% in 2008 and 5.9% in 2007.

Our revolving credit agreement includes a
material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw. The facility also requires compliance with maximum debt to capitalization and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all required covenants as of
December 31, 2009.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

The fair value of our long-term debt at December 31, 2009
and 2008 was approximately $1.02 billion and $924 million, respectively.

Aggregate maturities follow:

5) COMMON STOCK

In November, 2009, we declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend which was paid on December 15, 2009 to
shareholders of record as of December 1, 2009. All classes of common stock participated on a pro rata basis and, as required, references to share quantities, share prices and earnings per share for all periods presented or discussed have been
adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.

Dividends

Cash dividends of $.17 per share ($16.7 million in the aggregate) were declared and paid during 2009, $.16 per share ($16.2 million in the
aggregate) were declared and paid during 2008 and $.16 per share ($17.2 million in the aggregate) were declared and paid during 2007.

Stock Repurchase Programs

During 1999, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, our Board of Directors approved stock
repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase up to an aggregate of 43 million shares of our outstanding Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. There is no expiration
date for our stock repurchase programs. The following schedule provides information related to our stock repurchase programs for each of the three years ended December 31, 2009:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

(a)

Includes 13,000 during 2009, 50,500 during 2008 and 22,928 during 2007 of restricted shares that were forfeited by former employees pursuant to the terms of our
restricted stock purchase plan.

Stock-based Compensation Plans

At December 31, 2009, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans. Pursuant to the FASB’s guidance, we expense the
grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation pursuant to the straight-line method over the stated vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The expense associated with share-based compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,
share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities. The applicable FASB guidance requires that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized be
classified as financing cash flows. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, there were no net excess tax benefits generated.

Compensation
costs related to outstanding stock options were recognized as follows: (i) a pre-tax charge of $9.9 million ($6.2 million after-tax) or $.06 per diluted share during 2009; (ii) a pre-tax charge of $10.4 million ($6.4 million after-tax) or
$.06 per diluted share during 2008, and; (iii) a pre-tax charge of $8.8 million ($5.5 million after-tax) or $.05 per diluted share during 2007. In addition, during the years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007, compensation costs of $2.8 million ($1.8
million after-tax), $3.4 million ($2.1 million after-tax) and $7.8 million ($4.8 million after-tax), respectively, were recognized related to restricted stock.

We adopted the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended in 2008, (the “Stock Incentive Plan”) which replaced our Amended and Restated 1992 Stock Option Plan which expired in July of 2005. An
aggregate of fourteen million shares of Class B Common Stock has been reserved under the Stock Incentive Plan. There were 2,635,000, 2,773,250, and 2,405,500 stock options, net of cancellations, granted during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
per option weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $7.93, $3.08 and $4.70, respectively. Stock options to purchase Class B Common Stock have been granted to our officers, key employees and directors
under our above referenced stock option plans. All stock options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of the grant. Options are exercisable ratably over a four-year period beginning one year after the date
of the grant. All outstanding options expire five years after the date of the grant.

The fair value of each option grant was
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions derived from averaging the number of options granted during the most recent five-year period that were granted or have
vestings after January 1, 2006. The 2007 and 2008 weighted-average assumptions were each based upon twenty-two option grants and the 2009 weighted-average assumptions were based upon nineteen option grants.

The risk-free
rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon four year yield in effect at the time of grant. The expected life of the stock options granted was estimated using the historical behavior of employees. Expected volatility was based on historical
volatility for a period equal to the stock option’s expected life. Expected dividend yield is based on our actual dividend yield at the time of grant.

In addition to the Stock Incentive Plan, we have the following stock incentive and purchase plans: (i) a Second Amended and Restated 2001 Employees’ Restricted Stock Purchase Plan (“2001
Plan”) which allows eligible participants to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock at par value, subject to certain restrictions, and; (ii) a 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows eligible employees to purchase shares of Class B
Common Stock at a ten percent discount. There were 138,870, 117,914 and, 84,188 shares issued pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Compensation expense recorded in connection with this plan was
$316,000, $328,000 and $320,000 during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We have reserved 4.4 million shares of Class B
Common Stock for issuance under these various plans (excluding terminated plans) and have issued approximately 1,658,000 shares, net of cancellations, pursuant to the terms of these plans (excluding terminated plans) as of December 31, 2009, of
which 31,638 became fully vested during 2009, 296,400 became fully vested during 2008 and 388,128 became fully vested during 2007.

During the first quarter of 2009, pursuant to the 2001 Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) approved the issuance of 109,850 restricted shares of our Class B Common Stock at $20.26 per share
($2.2 million in the aggregate) to our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chairman of the Board. These shares, which were issued pursuant to a provision in our CEO’s employment agreement, are scheduled to vest ratably on the first,
second, third and fourth anniversary dates of the grant, assuming our CEO remains employed by us. In the event that our CEO’s employment is terminated by reason of disability, death, without proper cause or due to breach of the CEO’s
employment agreement by us, the vesting of these awards will occur immediately. In connection with this grant, we recorded compensation expense of $482,000 during 2009 and the remaining expense associated with this award (estimated at $1.7 million
as of December 31, 2009) will be recorded over the remaining vesting periods of the award.

During the first quarter of
2008, pursuant to the 2001 Plan, the Committee approved the issuance of 62,190 restricted shares of our Class B Common Stock at $24.12 per share ($1.5 million in the aggregate) to our CEO. These shares are scheduled to vest ratably on the first,
second, third and fourth anniversary dates of the grant and are subject to the same conditions and terms as mentioned above in connection with the grant of restricted shares during the first quarter of 2009. 15,548 of these shares became fully
vested in 2009. In connection with this grant, we recorded compensation expense of $375,000 during 2009 and $360,000 during 2008 and the remaining expense associated with this award (estimated at $765,000 as of December 31, 2009) will be
recorded over the remaining vesting periods of the award.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, pursuant to the 2001 Plan, the
Committee approved the issuance of 61,362 restricted shares of our Class B Common Stock at $24.45 per share ($1.5 million in the aggregate) to our



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

CEO. These shares are scheduled to vest ratably on the first, second, third and fourth anniversary dates of the grant and are subject to the same conditions and terms as mentioned above in
connection with the grant of restricted shares during the first quarter of 2009. 15,340 of these shares became fully vested in each of 2009 and 2008. In connection with this grant, we recorded compensation expense of $375,000 during each of 2009 and
2008 and $42,000 during 2007. The remaining expense associated with this award (estimated at $708,000 as of December 31, 2009) will be recorded over the remaining vesting periods of the award.

Additionally, during 2007, pursuant to the 2001 Plan, the Committee approved the issuance of 22,250 restricted shares of our Class B Common
stock at a weighted average of $29.62 per share ($659,000 in the aggregate) to various employees. These shares have various vesting schedules. We recorded compensation expense of $152,000, $135,000 and $93,000 during 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, in connection with these grants and the remaining expense associated with these awards (estimated at $317,000 as of December 31, 2009) will be recorded over the remaining vesting periods of the awards, assuming the recipients
remain employed by us.

During the fourth quarter of 2006, pursuant to the 2001 Plan, the Committee approved the issuance of
254,000 restricted shares (net of cancellations) of our Class B Common Stock at $25.71 per share ($6.5 million in the aggregate) to various officers and employees. These shares are scheduled to vest in November, 2010. In connection with this grant,
we recorded compensation expense of $1.5 million, $1.4 million during and $2.0 million during 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The remaining expense associated with this award (estimated at $1.4 million as of December 31, 2009) will be
recorded over the remaining vesting periods of the award, assuming the recipients remain employed by us.

At December 31,
2009, 23,512,052 shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock
under other incentive plans. Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock.

In connection with the long-term incentive plans described above, we recorded compensation expense of $3.2 million in 2009, $3.7 million in 2008 and $8.1 million in 2007. Including the stock option related compensation expense recorded
pursuant to 123R, of $9.9 million in 2009, $10.4 million in 2008 and $8.8 million in 2007, we recorded a total stock compensation expense of $13.1 million in 2009, $14.1 million in 2008 and $16.9 million in 2007.

6) INCOME TAXES

Components of income tax expense/(benefit) from continuing operations are as follows (amounts in thousands):



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

Deferred taxes are required to be classified based on the
financial statement classification of the related assets and liabilities which give rise to temporary differences. Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities. The components of deferred taxes are as follows (amounts in thousands):

The effective tax rate, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income
from continuing operations before income taxes, minus income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests, was 39.6% during 2009, 39.0% during 2008 and 38.0% during 2007. The increases in the effective tax rates during the
2009, as compared to 2008, consisted primarily of the $4.3 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded during the second quarter of 2009 resulting from the nondeductible portion of the South Texas Health System affiliates settlement. The increase
in the effective tax rates during 2008, as compared to 2007, resulted primarily from an increase in the effective state income tax rate.

A reconciliation between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate on continuing operations is as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

The net deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised as
follows (amounts in thousands):

The assets and liabilities classified as current relate primarily to the allowance for uncollectible patient
accounts, compensation-related accruals and the current portion of the temporary differences related to self- insurance reserves. At December 31, 2009, state net operating loss carryforwards (expiring in years 2010 through 2029), and credit
carryforwards available to offset future taxable income approximated $407 million, representing approximately $22.9 million in deferred state tax benefit (net of the federal benefit).

A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Based
on available evidence, it is more likely than not that certain of our state tax benefits will not be realized, therefore, valuation allowances of $23.1 million and $29.8 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. During 2009, the valuation allowance on these state tax benefits decreased by $6.7 million due to expired net operating losses not realized.

We adopted the provisions of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes effective January 1, 2007. During 2009 and 2008, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued
interest and penalties) were increased in the amount of approximately $2 million and $2.4 million respectively, due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years. Also during 2008, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions
(including accrued interest and penalties) were reduced due to the lapse of the statute of limitations resulting in a net income tax benefit of approximately $1 million. The balance at December 31, 2009 and 2008, if subsequently recognized,
that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes is approximately $4 million and $2 million, respectively.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we have approximately $1 million of accrued
interest and penalties. The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the 2006 and subsequent years. The IRS has commenced an audit for the tax year ended December 31, 2006. Foreign and U.S. state and local jurisdictions have
statutes of limitations generally ranging for 3 to 4 years. The statute of limitations on certain jurisdictions could expire within the next twelve months. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the
next 12 months however it is anticipated that any such change, if it were to occur, would not have a material impact on our results of operations.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

The tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits for the
year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is as follows (amounts in thousands).

7) LEASE COMMITMENTS

Certain of our hospital facilities are held under operating leases with Universal Health Realty Income Trust with terms expiring in 2011 through 2014 (see Note 9). Certain of these leases also contain
provisions allowing us to purchase the leased assets during the term or at the expiration of the lease at fair market value.

A summary of property under capital lease follows (amounts in thousands):

Future minimum rental payments under lease commitments with a term of more than one year as of
December 31, 2008, are as follows (amounts in thousands):



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

In the ordinary course of business, our facilities routinely
lease equipment pursuant to month-to-month lease arrangements that will likely result in future lease & rental expense in excess of the amounts indicated above. Capital lease obligations of $700,000 in 2009, $3.4 million in 2008 and $6.8
million in 2007 were incurred when we assumed capital lease obligations upon the acquisition of facilities or entered into capital leases for new equipment.

8) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Professional and General Liability
Claims and Property Insurance

Effective January 1, 2008, most of our subsidiaries became self-insured for
malpractice exposure up to $10 million per occurrence, as compared to $20 million per occurrence in the prior year. We purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of $10 million up to
$195 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. However, we are liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.

Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other
things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of
amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent
uncertainties involved in making this estimate. Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse
effect on our future results of operations.

As of December 31, 2009, the total accrual for our professional and general
liability claims was $266 million, of which $46 million is included in other current liabilities. As of December 31, 2008, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $272 million ($271 million net of expected
recoveries from state guaranty funds) of which $42 million is included in other current liabilities. As a result of a commercial insurer’s liquidation in 2002, we became liable for unpaid claims related to our facilities, some of which remain
outstanding as of December 31, 2009. The reserve for the estimated future claims payments for these outstanding liabilities is included in the accrual for our professional and general liability claims as of December 31, 2009.

During the second quarter of 2009, based upon a reserve analysis, we recorded a $23 million reduction to our professional and general
liability self-insurance reserves relating to years prior to 2009. This favorable change in our estimated future claims payments, which was included in our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2009, was partially due to the
favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate as well as a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of a company-wide patient
safety initiative undertaken during the last few years.

Effective April 1, 2009, we have commercial property insurance
policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from windstorm damage up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence. Losses resulting from non-named windstorms are subject to a $250,000 deductible. Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject
to deductibles between 3% and 5% (based upon the location of the facility) of the declared total insurable value of the property. In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and
flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses.). Our earthquake limit is $250 million, except for facilities in Alaska, California and the New Madrid (which includes certain counties located in Arkansas,
Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee)



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

and Pacific Northwest Seismic Zones which are subject to a $100 million limitation. The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million. Earthquake losses are subject to a $250,000 deductible for
our facilities located in all states except California, Alaska, Washington, Puerto Rico and the New Madrid where earthquake losses are subject to deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% (based upon the location of the facility) of the declared total
insurable value of the property. Flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility. Due to an increase in property losses experienced nationwide in recent years, the cost of commercial property
insurance has increased. As a result, catastrophic coverage for earthquake and flood has been limited to annual aggregate losses (as opposed to per occurrence losses). Given these insurance market conditions, there can be no assurance that a
continuation of these unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained by us, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various other litigation, as outlined
below.

Litigation and Administrative Appeal of CMS’s Attempt to Terminate Medicare Participation of Two Rivers
Psychiatric Hospital:

Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital (“Two Rivers”), a behavioral health facility operated
by one of our subsidiaries, received a notice of termination of its Medicare/Medicaid Certification as a result of Two Rivers’ alleged failure to correct certain deficiencies which make it ineligible for Medicare program participation. We are
attempting to resolve these issues amicably with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) in an effort to prevent the termination from going into effect. In the interim, Two Rivers has filed an administrative appeal with the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Departmental Appeals Board, Civil Remedies Division, seeking review of that decision. In order to prevent CMS from terminating the facility from the program prior to a hearing in the administrative
appeal, Two Rivers has filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against CMS’ proceeding with the termination. By agreement, the court has
issued a temporary restraining order preventing CMS from terminating Two Rivers from the Medicare/Medicaid program until such time that a settlement has been reached with CMS or a preliminary injunction has been ruled upon by the court. In the event
that a settlement is not reached or a preliminary injunction is not issued, the termination could go into effect, pending resolution of the administrative appeal. We can provide no assurance that Two Rivers will not ultimately lose its Medicare
Certification and any such termination would have a material adverse effect on the facility’s future results of operations and financial condition. The operating result of Two Rivers did not have a material impact on our 2009 consolidated
results of operations.

False Claims Act Case Against Virginia Behavioral Health Facilities:

In late 2007 and again on July 3, 2008 and January 27, 2009, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services
(“OIG”) issued subpoenas to two of our facilities, Marion Youth Center and Mountain Youth Academy, seeking documents related to the treatment of Medicaid beneficiaries at the facilities. It was our understanding at that time that the OIG
was investigating whether claims for reimbursement submitted by those facilities to the Virginia Medicaid program were supported by adequate documentation of the services provided which could be considered to be a basis for a false claims act
violation. On August 4, 2008, the Office of the Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Virginia issued a subpoena to Keystone Newport News, another of our facilities. It was our understanding at that time that the Office of Attorney General was
investigating whether Keystone Newport News complied with various Virginia laws and regulations, including documentation requirements.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

In response to these subpoenas, we produced the requested
documents on a rolling basis and we cooperated with the investigations in all respects. We also met with representatives of the OIG, the Virginia Attorney General, the United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, and the United
States Department of Justice Civil Division on several occasions to discuss a possible resolution of this matter. However, the parties were not able to reach a resolution. Consequently, on November 4, 2009, the United States Department of Justice
and the Virginia Attorney General intervened in a qui tam case that had been filed under seal in 2007 against Universal Health Services, Inc., Keystone Marion, LLC and Keystone Education and Youth Services, LLC, doing business as the Marion Youth
Center. The qui tam case was brought by four former employees of the Marion Youth Center. At this time, based upon a press release issued by the Department of Justice, the allegations being pursued by the United States and the Commonwealth of
Virginia appear to relate solely to the Marion Youth Center. The United States and the Commonwealth of Virginia now have 120 days in which to serve their complaint upon the defendants. We have established a reserve in connection with this matter
which did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Although we will continue to work towards a settlement, there is no assurance that a settlement can be reached, and, should a settlement be reached, we are unable at this time to
determine the ultimate settlement amount. If a settlement is not reached, we will defend ourselves vigorously against these allegations. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in the litigation or that the case will be limited to the Marion
Youth Center.

Ethridge v. Universal Health Services et. al:

In June, 2008, we and one of our acute care facilities, Lancaster Community Hospital, were named as defendants in a wage and hour lawsuit in
Los Angeles County Superior Court. This is a purported class action lawsuit alleging that the hospital failed to provide sufficient meal and break periods to certain employees. We have denied liability and are defending the case vigorously which has
not yet been certified as a class action by the court. We are still uncertain as to the legal viability and extent of the claims, and, as such, are unable to determine the extent of potential financial exposure at this time.

The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare
participation requirements, various licensure and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible
violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers. Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected
to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet
or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices,
including ours. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, from time to time, we are subjected to inquiries or actions with respect to our facilities. There is no assurance that we will not be
faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed above. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a
material adverse effect on us.

In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business
are pending. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

During the third quarter of 2009, Southwest Healthcare System (“SWHCS”), which operates Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland
Valley Regional Medical Center in Riverside County, California, entered into an agreement with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The agreement required SWHCS to engage an independent quality monitor to assist SWHCS in
meeting all CMS’ conditions of participation. Further, the agreement provided that, during the last 60 days of the agreement, CMS would conduct a full Medicare certification survey. That survey took place the week of January 11,
2010. At present, we have not been advised of the results from CMS. While we believe that SWHCS has complied with all obligations under the agreement, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of the survey or that the outcome would not have
a material adverse effect on us. The operating results of SWHCS did have a material impact on our 2009 consolidated results of operations.

We and our South Texas Health System affiliates, which operate McAllen Medical Center, McAllen Heart Hospital, Edinburg Regional Medical Center and certain other affiliates, were served with a subpoena
dated November 21, 2005, issued by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”). At that time, the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s office in Houston, Texas indicated that the subpoena
was part of an investigation under the False Claims Act regarding compliance with Medicare and Medicaid rules and regulations pertaining to payments to physicians and the solicitation of patient referrals from physicians from January 1, 1999 to the
date of the subpoena, related to the South Texas Health System. The Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s office in Houston, Texas focused on certain arrangements entered into by the South Texas Health System affiliates which, the government
believes, may have violated Medicare and Medicaid rules and regulations pertaining to payments to physicians and the solicitation of patient referrals from physicians and other matters relating to payments to various individuals which may have
constituted improper payments. We cooperated with the investigations and, during the fourth quarter of 2009, reached an agreement to resolve the matter. We agreed to make a payment in the amount of $27.5 million, which was paid in October of 2009,
and, with respect to the South Texas Health System affiliates, we have entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services. The CIA
requires South Texas Health System affiliates to develop and implement an enhanced compliance program and contains specific reporting requirements. During 2008, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $25 million to establish a reserve in connection with
this matter and recorded an additional $3 million during 2009. Also during 2009, we recorded a $4.3 million unfavorable discrete tax item to reflect the estimated nondeductible portion of the amount reserved. We do not expect to incur additional
material charges with respect to this matter.

In addition to our long-term debt obligations as discussed in Note
4-

Long-Term Debt

and our operating lease obligations as discussed in Note 7-

Lease Commitments

, we have various other contractual commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2009 as follows: (i) estimated future construction
commitment of $34 million related to the construction of a new 171-bed acute care facility located in Palmdale, California; (ii) other combined estimated future purchase obligations of $192 million related to a long-term contract with a
third-party to provide certain data processing services, laboratory information system and order management technology for our acute care facilities ($104 million), expected costs to be paid to a third-party vendor in connection with the purchase
and implementation of an electronic health records application for our acute care facilities ($72 million), estimated minimum liabilities for physician commitments expected to be paid in the future ($15 million), and the remaining commitment in
connection with the funding of a portion of our Chief Executive Officer’s gift to the College of William & Mary ($1 million), and; (iii) combined estimated future payments of $230 million related to our non-contributory, defined
benefit pension plan ($215 million consisting of estimated payments through 2086) and other retirement plan liabilities ($15 million).

As of December 31, 2009, we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds. Our outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of December 31, 2009 totaled $84
million consisting of: (i) $68 million related to our self-insurance programs; (ii) $15 million related primarily to

pending appeals of legal judgments (including judgments related to our
self-insurance programs), and; (iii) $1 million of other debt guarantees related to public utilities and entities in which we own a noncontrolling interest.

9) RELATIONSHIP WITH UNIVERSAL HEALTH REALTY INCOME TRUST AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust:

At
December 31, 2009, we held approximately 6.5% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the “Trust”). We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement pursuant to the terms of
which, we conduct the Trust’s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities. In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust. Management believes that
it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting. We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $1.6 million during each of 2009 and 2008 and $1.4 million during 2007. Our pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $1.1 million during 2009, $900,000 during 2008 and $1.5 million
during 2007 and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year. The carrying value of this investment was $8.1 million and $8.9 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is
included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The market value of this investment was $25.2 million at December 31, 2009 and $25.9 million at December 31, 2008, based on the closing price of the Trust’s
stock on the respective dates.

Total rent expense under the operating leases on the hospital facilities with the Trust was
$16.3 million during 2009 and $16.1 million during each of 2008 and 2007. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds non-controlling
ownership interests.

The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain properties from us and immediately leasing
the properties back to our respective subsidiaries. Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5-year renewal terms. Each lease also
provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below. The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in
the base year. The leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.

Pursuant to the terms of the leases with the Trust, we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term. In addition,
we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or; (ii) renew the lease on the respective
leased facility at the end of, and for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer. We also have the right to purchase the respective leased facilities at the end of the lease terms or any
renewal terms at the appraised fair market value. In addition, during 2006, as part of the overall exchange and substitution transaction relating to Chalmette Medical Center (“Chalmette”) which was completed during the third quarter of
2006, as well as the early five year lease renewals on Southwest Healthcare System-Inland Valley Campus (“Inland Valley”), Wellington Regional Medical Center (“Wellington”), McAllen Medical Center and The Bridgeway
(“Bridgeway”), the Trust agreed to amend the Master Lease to include a change of control provision. The change of control provision grants us the right, upon one month’s notice should a change of control of the Trust occur, to
purchase any or all of the four leased hospital properties at their appraised fair market value purchase price.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued

The table below details the renewal options and terms for each
of our four hospital facilities leased from the Trust:

(a)

We have four 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2031).

(b)

We have two 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2021) and two 5-year renewal options at fair market value lease rates (2022 through 2031).

(c)

A member of our Board of Directors and member of the Executive Committee is Of Counsel to the law firm used by us as our principal outside counsel. This Board member is also the trustee of certain trusts
for the benefit of our CEO and his family. This law firm also provides personal legal services to our CEO.

10) PENSION PLAN

We maintain contributory and non-contributory retirement plans for eligible employees. Our contributions to the
contributory plan amounted to $20.4 million, $19.8 million and $16.9 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The non-contributory plan is a defined benefit pension plan which covers employees of one of our subsidiaries. The benefits are based
on years of service and the employee’s highest compensation for any five years of employment. Our funding policy is to contribute annually at least the minimum amount that should be funded in accordance with the provisions of ERISA.

accounting, taxation, legal, advertising, design and construction and patient accounting as well as the operating results for our other operating entities including outpatient surgery and radiation centers. The chief operating decision making group
for our acute care hospital services and behavioral health care services is comprised of our Chief Executive Officer, the President and the Presidents of each operating segment. The Presidents for each operating segment also manage the profitability
of each respective segment’s various facilities. The operating segments are managed separately because each operating segment represents a business unit that offers different types of healthcare services or operates in different healthcare
environments. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.
