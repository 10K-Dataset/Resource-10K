PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

Our principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers. As
of February 27, 2014, we owned and/or operated 24 acute care hospitals and 193 behavioral health centers located in 37 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As part of our ambulatory treatment centers division, we
manage and/or own outright or in partnerships with physicians, 5 surgical hospitals and surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 4 states.

Net revenues from our acute care hospitals, surgical hospitals, surgery centers and radiation oncology centers accounted for 49% of our consolidated net revenues in 2013, 50% in 2012 and 51% in 2011. Net
revenues from our behavioral health care facilities accounted for 50% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2013 and 2012 and 49% during 2011.

Services provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services,
pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services. We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning,
physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.

Our Mission

Our mission and objective is to provide superior healthcare services that patients recommend to families and friends, physicians prefer
for their patients, purchasers select for their clients, employees are proud of, and investors seek for long-term results. To achieve this, we have a commitment to:

•

service excellence

•

continuous improvement in measurable ways



•

employee development

•

ethical and fair treatment

•

teamwork

•

compassion

•

innovation in service delivery

Business Strategy

We believe community-based hospitals will remain
the focal point of the healthcare delivery network and we are committed to a philosophy of self-determination for both the company and our hospitals.

Acquisition of Additional Hospitals.

We selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by acquiring, constructing or leasing additional hospital facilities. We are committed
to a program of rational growth around our core businesses, while retaining the missions of the hospitals we manage and the communities we serve. Such expansion may provide us with access to new markets and new healthcare delivery capabilities. We
also continue to examine our facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities that we believe do not have the potential to contribute to our growth or operating strategy.

Improvement of Operations of Existing Hospitals and Services.

We also seek to increase the operating revenues and
profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services, improvement of existing services, physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls.

We are involved in continual development activities for the benefit of our existing facilities. From time to time applications are filed
with state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals in states which require certificates of need, or CONs. Although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our
operations, no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in these efforts.

Quality and Efficiency of
Services.

Pressures to contain healthcare costs and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible. We are
responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services. In addition, in response to cost containment pressures, we continue to implement programs at our facilities designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while
continuing to provide quality care, including more efficient use of professional and paraprofessional staff, monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage, improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more
efficient billing and collection procedures. In addition, we will continue to emphasize innovation in our response to the rapid changes in regulatory trends and market conditions while fulfilling our commitment to patients, physicians, employees,
communities and our stockholders.

In addition, our aggressive recruiting of highly qualified physicians and developing
provider networks help to establish our facilities as an important source of quality healthcare in their respective communities.

2013 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity:

Acquisitions of
Assets and Businesses:

During 2013, we spent $13 million for the purchase of real property located in Pennsylvania,
Nevada and Arizona.



Divestitures:

During 2013, we received $37 million in connection with the divestiture of Peak Behavioral Health Services and certain other assets and
real property including three previously closed behavioral health care facilities. We agreed to sell Peak Behavioral Health Services as part of our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health
Corporation in October of 2012. The aggregate pre-tax gain on these divestitures did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2013.

Hospital Utilization

We believe that the most important factors
relating to the overall utilization of a hospital include the quality and market position of the hospital and the number, quality and specialties of physicians providing patient care within the facility. Generally, we believe that the ability of a
hospital to meet the health care needs of its community is determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that affect utilization include general and
local economic conditions, market penetration of managed care programs, the degree of outpatient use, the availability of reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and demographic changes such as the growth in local populations.
Utilization across the industry also is being affected by improvements in clinical practice, medical technology and pharmacology. Current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement
policies of third party payors. We are also unable to predict the extent to which these industry trends will continue or accelerate. In addition, hospital operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, such as higher patient volumes and
net patient service revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year.

The following table sets forth certain operating
statistics for hospitals operated by us for the years indicated. Accordingly, information related to hospitals acquired during the five-year period has been included from the respective dates of acquisition, and information related to hospitals
divested during the five year period has been included up to the respective dates of divestiture. Information related to the behavioral health care facilities acquired by us in connection with our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.
(“PSI”), excluding 3 PSI facilities that were divested during 2011 pursuant to our agreement with the FTC, is included for the period of November 16, 2010 through December 31, 2012. The licensed and available beds for those
facilities are included in 2010 on a weighted average basis for the period owned. Information related to the behavioral health care facilities acquired by us in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation is included for the



period of October 10, 2012 through December 31, 2012. The licensed and available beds for those facilities are included in 2012 on a weighted average basis for the period owned.

(1)

The statistical information for Auburn Regional Medical Center located in Washington (divested during the fourth quarter of 2012) is included in the above information
through its respective divestiture date.

(2)

“Average Available Beds” is the number of beds which are actually in service at any given time for immediate patient use with the necessary equipment and
staff available for patient care. A hospital may have appropriate licenses for more beds than are in service for a number of reasons, including lack of demand, incomplete construction, and anticipation of future needs

(3)

“Patient Days” is the sum of all patients for the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient.

(4)

“Occupancy Rate” is calculated by dividing average patient days (total patient days divided by the total number of days in the period) by the number of
average beds, either available or licensed.

Sources of Revenue

We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare
program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients. See

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations—Sources of Revenue

for
additional disclosure. Other information related to our revenues, income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements,

Segment Reporting.

Regulation and Other Factors

Overview:

The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure
and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse provisions (including, but not limited to, federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and
other illegal inducements to potential referral sources, false claims submitted to federal health care programs



and self-referrals by physicians). Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to
significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be
given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions, or that we would not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties if so subjected. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, a significant governmental inquiry or
action under one of the above laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us.

Licensing,
Certification and Accreditation:

All of our hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local statutes and regulations and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care,
equipment and cleanliness. Our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal, state and local health agencies, as well as the requirements of municipal building codes, health codes and local
fire departments. Various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment.

All of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by The Joint Commission. All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral
health centers are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.

If
any of our facilities were to lose its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other
payors. We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to
change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on operations.

Certificates of Need:

Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need (“CON”)
laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services. Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our inability to complete an acquisition, expansion or
replacement, the imposition of civil or, in some cases, criminal sanctions, the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility’s license, which could harm our business. In addition, significant CON
reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements. In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those
requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.

Conversion Legislation:

Many
states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities. These laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general, advance notification and community
involvement. In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions. Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to
provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a health care facility to a for-profit entity. The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased
review of not-for-profit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of not-for-profit hospitals.

Utilization Review:

Federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by Medicare and Medicaid
patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services. The law and regulations require Peer Review Organizations (“PROs”) to review the appropriateness of Medicare and



Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of diagnosis related group (“DRG”) classifications and the appropriateness of cases of
extraordinary length of stay. PROs may deny payment for services provided, assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) that a provider that is in substantial non-compliance
with the standards of the PRO be excluded from participating in the Medicare program. We have contracted with PROs in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews.

Audits:

Most hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of Medicare and Medicaid program submitted
claims. If these audits identify overpayments, we could be required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years’ payments subject to various administrative appeal rights. The federal government contracts with third-party “recovery
audit contractors” (“RACs”) and “Medicaid integrity contractors” (“MICs”), on a contingent fee basis, to audit the propriety of payments to Medicare and Medicaid providers. The Recovery Audit Prepayment Review
demonstration program will enable RACs to review claims before they are paid to ensure that the provider complied with all Medicare payment rules. Currently, the demonstration program is targeting states with high populations of fraud- and
error-prone providers. Similarly, Medicare zone program integrity contractors (“ZPICs”) target claims for potential fraud and abuse. Additionally, Medicare administrative contractors (“MACs”) must ensure they pay the right
amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) recently announced its intent to consolidate many of these Medicare and
Medicaid program integrity functions into new unified program integrity contractors (“UPICs”), though it remains unclear what effect, if any, this proposed consolidation may have. We have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of
federal healthcare payments during the last three years, the results of which have not required material adjustments to our consolidated results of operations. However, potential liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed
established reserves, and any excess could potentially be substantial. Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations also provide for withholding Medicare and Medicaid overpayments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash
flow.

Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation

The Stark Law:

The Social Security Act includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” This law prohibits
physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception is met. These types of referrals are known as
“self-referrals.” Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include civil penalties up to $15,000 for each violation, up to $100,000 for sham arrangements, up to $10,000 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion
from the federal health care programs. There are a number of exceptions to the self-referral prohibition, including an exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital
department unit, service or subpart. However, federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities. This recent regulation
also places a number of compliance requirements on physician-owned hospitals related to reporting of ownership interest. There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including
employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements.

We monitor all
aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Nonetheless, because the law in this area is complex and constantly
evolving, there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the Stark Law.

Anti-kickback Statute:

A provision of the Social Security Act known as the “anti-kickback statute” prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting,
receiving, offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using, referring, ordering, recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state



health care program. However, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation; one is no longer required to “have actual knowledge or specific
intent to commit a violation of” the anti-kickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law.

The
anti-kickback statute contains certain exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) has issued regulations that provide for “safe harbors,” from the federal
anti-kickback statute for various activities. These activities, which must meet certain requirements, include (but are not limited to) the following: investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services
and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance
subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services. The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe
harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti-kickback statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.

Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to comply with
current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the
anti-kickback statute or other applicable laws. Violations of the anti-kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, however, under 18 U.S.C. Section 3571, this fine may be increased to
$250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations. Civil money penalties may include fines of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in
Medicare and Medicaid.

Similar State Laws:

Many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit
payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care. These statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss
of licensure. In many instances, the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes. However, in most cases, little precedent exists for the interpretation or
enforcement of these state laws.

These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we don’t have the
benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation. It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us
to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for
possible violations of one or more of these laws (see “Legal Proceedings”), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In
addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.

If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we
could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other
federal and state health care programs. The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Regulations:

A current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and, in particular, actions
being brought by individuals on the government’s behalf under the False Claims Act’s qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions.



Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the Federal government.

When a defendant is determined by a court of law to have violated the False Claims Act, the defendant may be liable for up to three times
the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability often arises when an entity
knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (“FERA”) has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the False Claims Act, eliminating
requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds. FERA also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention, as well as the receipt, of overpayments. In addition, recent
changes to the anti-kickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil False Claims Act. Further, a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a
private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court. Recent changes to the False Claims Act require that federal healthcare program overpayments be returned within 60 days from the date the overpayment was identified, or by
the date any corresponding cost report was due, whichever is later. Failure to return an overpayment within this period may result in additional civil False Claims Act liability.

Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions:

The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false
claims to Medicare and Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, billing for services without prescribed documentation, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement
and cost report fraud. Like the anti-kickback statute, these provisions are very broad.

Further, the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs, whether or not payments
under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs. HIPAA also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in Medicare. There are civil penalties for prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to billing for medically
unnecessary products or services.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy Requirements:

The
administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims
and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health
information. The privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed. Violations of HIPAA can result in
both criminal and civil fines and penalties.

We believe that we are in material compliance with the privacy regulations of
HIPAA, as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance. The HIPAA security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of patient information. HITECH has since strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates, and
created new security breach notification requirements. HITECH has also extended the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a HIPAA violation has occurred. We believe that we have been in substantial compliance with
HIPAA and HITECH requirements to date. Recent changes to the HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance requirements for healthcare providers, including expanded obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as create new
liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.



Red Flags Rule:

In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Red Flags
Rule requires financial institutions and businesses maintaining accounts to address the risk of identity theft. The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010, signed on December 18, 2010, appears to exclude certain healthcare providers from
the Red Flags Rule, but permits the FTC or relevant agencies to designate additional creditors subject to the Red Flags Rule through future rulemaking if the agencies determine that the person in question maintains accounts subject to foreseeable
risk of identity theft. Compliance with any such future rulemaking may require additional expenditures in the future.

Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005:

On July 29, 2005, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005
was enacted, which has the goal of reducing medical errors and increasing patient safety. This legislation establishes a confidential reporting structure in which providers can voluntarily report “Patient Safety Work Product”
(“PSWP”) to “Patient Safety Organizations” (“PSOs”). Under the system, PSWP is made privileged, confidential and legally protected from disclosure. PSWP does not include medical, discharge or billing records or any
other original patient or provider records but does include information gathered specifically in connection with the reporting of medical errors and improving patient safety. This legislation does not preempt state or federal mandatory disclosure
laws concerning information that does not constitute PSWP. PSOs are certified by the Secretary of the HHS for three-year periods and analyze PSWP, provide feedback to providers and may report non-identifiable PSWP to a database. In addition, PSOs
are expected to generate patient safety improvement strategies.

Environmental Regulations:

Our healthcare
operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. Infectious waste generators, including hospitals, face substantial penalties for improper disposal of
medical waste, including civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day of noncompliance, criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day, imprisonment, and remedial costs. In addition, our operations, as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are
subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations. We believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws.

Corporate Practice of Medicine:

Several states, including Florida, Nevada, California and Texas, have laws and/or regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing
physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the
recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the
physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These statutes and/or regulations vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies. We do not expect these state corporate practice of
medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations. Many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and fee-splitting with physicians. We do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements.

EMTALA:

All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
(“EMTALA”). This federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under Medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the
patient is suffering from a medical emergency, to either stabilize the patient’s condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition. Our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists
regardless of a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first
inquire about the patient’s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program. In addition to any liabilities that a hospital may incur under EMTALA, an
injured patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that
statute.



The federal government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which patients do
not actually present to a hospital’s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a
hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions. EMTALA does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services; however, CMS has recently sought industry comments on the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients
and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively. CMS has not yet issued regulations or guidance in response to that request for comments. The government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce
EMTALA violations actively in the future. We believe that we operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.

Health Care
Industry Investigations:

We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation.
Please see

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

included herein for additional disclosure. In addition, currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential
non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies. Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential
licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.

We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or
exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices,
including ours. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions, or that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or
penalties in connection with the investigations. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, the government’s inquiry and/or action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.

Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations. It is possible
that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executives and/or managers could
be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation and/or named as defendants in private litigation.

Revenue Rulings 98-15 and 2004-51:

In March 1998 and May 2004, the IRS issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals. As
a result of the tax rulings, the IRS has proposed, and may in the future propose, to revoke the tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as
unrelated business taxable income to them. The tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts regarding the tax-exempt or public charity status of a not-for-profit partner or the
characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with not-for-profits.

State Rate Review:

Some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget
review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state. In the aggregate, state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected
our results of operations.

Medical Malpractice Tort Law Reform:

Medical malpractice tort law has historically been
maintained at the state level. All states have laws governing medical liability lawsuits. Over half of the states have limits on



damages awards. Almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in malpractice lawsuits, and many states have established limits on attorney fees. Many states had bills introduced
in their legislative sessions to address medical malpractice tort reform. Proposed solutions include enacting limits on non-economic damages, malpractice insurance reform, and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and
the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates. Reform legislation has also been proposed, but not adopted, at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area.

Compliance Program:

Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1998. Currently, the
program’s elements include a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs, and a means for enforcing the program’s
policies.

Since its initial adoption, the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the
industry’s expectations and our needs. Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and
operational aspects of our business. Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program. Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing, and cost reports,
comprise the bulk of these areas. Financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, including compliance with anti-kickback and Stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and
training, standardized documentation requirements, and review and audit.

Medical Staff and Employees

Our facilities had approximately 66,100 employees on December 31, 2013, of whom approximately 47,000 were
employed full-time. Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals. In a number of our markets, physicians may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to
ours. Within our acute care division, approximately 140 physicians are employed by physician practice management subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations. Members of
the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. In addition, within our behavioral health division, approximately 380 psychiatrists
are employed by subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations. Each of our hospitals is managed on a day-to-day basis by a managing director employed by a subsidiary of
ours. In addition, a Board of Governors, including members of the hospital’s medical staff, governs the medical, professional and ethical practices at each hospital. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.

Approximately 1,600 of our employees at five of our hospitals are unionized. At Valley Hospital Medical Center, unionized employees
belong to the Culinary Workers and Bartenders Union, the International Union of Operating Engineers and the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”). Nurses and technicians at Desert Springs Hospital are represented by the SEIU and
International Union of Operating Engineers. At The George Washington University Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the SEIU or the Hospital Police Association. Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, certain technicians and
therapists, pharmacy assistants, and some clerical employees at HRI Hospital in Boston are represented by the SEIU. At Brooke Glen Behavioral Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the Teamsters and the Northwestern Nurses
Association/Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals. A union representation election was held at Corona Regional Medical Center (“Corona”) in January of 2013 for the nursing staff. A majority of those who cast
ballots voted to be represented by the United Nurses Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals (UNAC/UHCP). Corona timely filed objections to the election and an appeal. The results have not yet been certified. The National
Labor Relations Board is currently reviewing the appeal.



Competition

The health care industry is highly competitive. In recent years, competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in
the United States due to, among other things, regulatory and technological changes, increasing use of managed care payment systems, cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment. In all of the geographical areas in which we
operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals. In addition, some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may
be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sale and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to us.

In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us. Certain hospitals that are located in the areas served
by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical, surgical and behavioral health services, facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals. The increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities,
outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us.

The number and quality of
the physicians on a hospital’s staff are important factors in determining a hospital’s success and competitive advantage. Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of
patient treatment. We believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patient’s needs, the quality of other physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services
offered at the hospital’s facilities. We strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel, technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet
the needs of those physicians.

In addition, we depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support
personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals. We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel. Our
acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide, which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense in excess of the
inflation rate. In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels. To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may by required to limit the healthcare services provided in these
markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.

Many states in which we operate
hospitals have CON laws. The application process for approval of additional covered services, new facilities, changes in operations and capital expenditures is, therefore, highly competitive in these states. In those states that do not have CON laws
or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. See “Regulation and Other Factors.”

Our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our
competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals. Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment. In addition,
employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges. In return, hospitals secure commitments for a larger
number of potential patients. Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and
convenience. The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations.



A key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional
hospitals in select markets. The competition to acquire hospitals is significant. We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit health care companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities. Some of our competitors
have greater resources than we do. We intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth, but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms.

Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust:

At December 31, 2013, we held approximately 6.1% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the
“Trust”). We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the Trust’s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities.
In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust. Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust
using the equity method of accounting. We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $2.4 million during 2013, $2.1 million during 2012 and $2.0
million during 2011.

Our pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $842,000 during 2013, $1.2 million during 2012 and $4.6
million during 2011, and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year. Included in our share of the Trust’s income for 2012 and 2011 was approximately $500,000 in 2012 and $3.7 million in 2011
related to our share of the net favorable impact realized by the Trust in connection with: (i) gains on the sale of medical office buildings (in 2012 and 2011), and; (ii) gain on fair value recognition resulting from the Trust’s
purchase of minority ownership interests in majority owned limited liability companies partially offset by a provision for asset impairment (in 2011).

The carrying value of our investment in the Trust was $8.1 million and $9.3 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. The market value of our investment in the Trust was $31.5 million at December 31, 2013 and $39.9 million at December 31, 2012, based on the closing price of the Trust’s stock on the respective dates.

Total rent expense under the operating leases on the four hospital facilities with the Trust (as discussed below) was $16.4 million
during 2013 and $16.3 million during each of 2012 and 2011. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds either 100% of the ownership interest
or various noncontrolling, majority ownership interests.

The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain
properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries. Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional
5-year renewal terms. Each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below. The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter
revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year. The leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.

Pursuant to the terms of the leases with the Trust, we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of
the then current term. In addition, we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or;
(ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer. We also have the right to purchase the respective leased facilities
at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at their appraised fair market value as well as purchase any or all of the four leased hospital properties at their appraised fair market value upon one month’s notice should a change of
control of the Trust occur.



The table below details the remaining renewal options and terms for each of our four
hospital facilities leased from the Trust:

(a)

We have three 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2031).

(b)

We have one 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2021) and two 5-year renewal options at fair market value lease rates (2022 through 2031).

(c)

We have two 5-year renewal options at fair market value lease rates (2015 through 2024).

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

We are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, could also impact our business and results of operations.

A significant portion of our revenue is produced by facilities located in Nevada, Texas and California.

Nevada:

We own 6 acute care hospitals and 4 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in

Item 2. Properties

(we owned
two additional behavioral health facilities which were acquired by us from PSI in November, 2010 before the facilities were divested during the third and fourth quarters of 2011 pursuant to our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, as
discussed herein). On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 16% during each of 2013 and 2012 and 17% in 2011 of our consolidated net revenues. On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these
facilities generated 6% in 2013, 8% in 2012, and 11% in 2011 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.

Texas:

We own 7 acute care hospitals and 22 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in

Item 2. Properties

. On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 18% of our consolidated
net revenues during each of 2013, 2012 and 2011. On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 15% in 2013, 12% in 2012, and 14% in 2011 of our income from operations after net income
attributable to noncontrolling interest.

California:

We own 5 acute care hospitals and 6 behavioral healthcare
facilities as listed in

Item 2. Properties

. On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 9% in 2013 and 10% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2012 and 2011. On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for
corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 4% in 2013, 6% in 2012, and 5% in 2011 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.

The significant portion of our revenues and earnings derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to legislative,
regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in Nevada, Texas and California. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a
disproportionate effect on our overall business results.

Our revenues and results of operations are significantly
affected by payments received from the government and other third party payors.

We derive a significant portion of our
revenue from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and, in some cases, reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare
services. Payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding
restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities. We are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy
changes on our operations. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of, among other things, the substantial deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding requirements from
the federal healthcare reform legislation, may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs. If the rates paid or the scope of services covered by government payors are reduced, there could be a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million
annually from each of Texas, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Illinois, Virginia and Massachusetts, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in



Medicaid and other state based revenue programs (which have been implemented in various forms with respect to our areas of operation in the respective 2013 state fiscal years) as well as
regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. Based upon the state budgets for the 2013 fiscal year (which generally began at various times during the second half of 2012), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our
aggregate Medicaid rates were reduced by approximately 1% (or approximately $15 million annually) from the average rates in effect during the states’ 2012 fiscal years (which generally ended during the third quarter of 2012). Based upon the
state budgets for the 2014 fiscal year (which will generally began at various times during the second half of 2013), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates will remain relatively unchanged from the 2013 fiscal year rates.

In addition to changes in government reimbursement programs, our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private
payors, including managed care providers, significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals. Private payors, including managed care providers, increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment.

We expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls. Reductions in reimbursement
amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.

A worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States could materially affect our business and future results of operations.

Our patient volumes, revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance, which to a
large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets. A continuation or worsening of economic conditions may result in a continued high unemployment rate which will likely increase the number of individuals without health
insurance. As a result, our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes, particularly in less intense, more elective service lines, or a significant increase in services provided to uninsured patients. These factors could have a material
unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes, revenues and operating results.

Our patient revenues and payor mix during
the last few years were adversely affected by economic conditions, particularly in certain markets, such as Nevada, Texas and California, where a significant portion of our revenues are concentrated and unemployment rates remain high. In our acute
care business, we experienced net revenue pressures caused primarily by declining commercial payor utilization and an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients treated at our facilities. We can provide no assurance that these
trends will not continue. During 2013, our revenues and payor mix within our acute care operations have been volatile making it difficult to predict the results for 2014 or thereafter.

In addition, we recorded approximately $2.37 billion of aggregate goodwill as a result of our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010 and
Ascend in October, 2012, and, as of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $3.05 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Should the revenues and financial results of our acute care and/or behavioral health care
facilities be materially, unfavorably impacted due to, among other things, a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States that could negatively impact our patient volumes and reimbursement rates, a continued rise in the
unemployment rate and continued increases in the number of uninsured patients treated at our facilities, we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a
material adverse effect on our financial results.

Reductions or changes in Medicare funding could have a material
adverse effect on our future results of operations.

On January 3, 2013, President Obama signed into law the
American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the “2012 Act”). The 2012 Act postponed for two months sequestration cuts mandated under the Budget Control Act of



2011. The postponed sequestration cuts include a 2% annual reduction over ten years in Medicare spending to providers. Medicaid is exempt from sequestration. The 2012 Act provides a one-year fix
to statutory reductions in physician reimbursement and extends other Medicare provisions. In order to offset the cost of these extensions, the 2012 Act reduces payments to other providers totaling almost $26 billion over ten years. Approximately
half of those funds will come from reductions in Medicare reimbursement to hospitals. Although the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 has reduced certain sequestration-related budgetary cuts, spending reductions related to the Medicare program remain in
place. On December 26, 2013, President Obama signed into law H.J. Res. 59, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which includes the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 (“the Act”). In addition, on February 15, 2014, Public Law 113-082 was
enacted. The Act and subsequent federal legislation achieves new savings by extending sequestration for mandatory programs – including Medicare – for another three years, through 2024. Please see

Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Sources of Revenue-Medicare

, for additional disclosure.

The 2012 Act includes a document and coding (“DCI”) adjustment and a reduction in Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) payments. Expected to save $10.5 billion over 10
years, the DCI adjustment decreases projected Medicare hospital payments for inpatient and overnight care through a downward adjustment in annual base payment increases. These reductions are meant to recoup what Medicare authorities consider to be
“overpayments” to hospitals that occurred as a result of the transition to Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups. The reduction in Medicaid DSH payments is expected to save $4.2 billion over 10 years. This provision extends the
changes regarding DSH payments established by the Legislation and determines future allotments off of the rebased level.

We are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform.

On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”). The
Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “Reconciliation Act”), which contains a number of amendments to the PPACA, was signed into law on March 30, 2010. Two primary goals of the PPACA, combined with the
Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as the “Legislation”), are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.

Although it is expected that as a result of the Legislation there may be a reduction in uninsured patients, which should reduce our
expense from uncollectible accounts receivable, the Legislation makes a number of other changes to Medicare and Medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us. It has been projected that the Legislation will result in a net reduction in
Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals totaling $155 billion over 10 years. The Legislation revises reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of
incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals. The Legislation provides for decreases in the annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the market basket update beginning
October 1, 2011 for Medicare Part B reimbursable items and services and beginning October 1, 2012 for Medicare inpatient hospital services. The Legislation and subsequent revisions provide for reductions to both Medicare DSH and Medicaid
DSH payments. The Medicare DSH reductions began in October, 2013 with no material adverse impact to the reimbursements we receive expected until 2015 while Medicaid DSH reimbursements would not be adversely impacted until 2016. The Legislation
implements a value-based purchasing program, which will reward the delivery of efficient care. Conversely, certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters; such hospitals will include those with excessive
readmission or hospital-acquired condition rates.

A 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling limited the federal government’s
ability to expand health insurance coverage by holding unconstitutional sections of the Legislation that sought to withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain Medicaid coverage requirements. Pursuant to that decision, the federal
government may not penalize states that choose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion program by reducing their existing Medicaid funding. Therefore, states can choose to accept or not to participate without risking the loss of



federal Medicaid funding. As a result, many states, including Texas, have not expanded their Medicaid programs without the threat of loss of federal funding.

The various provisions in the Legislation that directly or indirectly affect Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are scheduled to take
effect over a number of years. The impact of the Legislation on healthcare providers will be subject to implementing regulations, interpretive guidance and possible future legislation. Certain Legislation provisions, such as those creating the
Medicare Shared Savings Program and the Independent Payment Advisory Board, create uncertainty in how healthcare may be reimbursed by federal programs in the future. Thus, we cannot predict the impact of the Legislation on our future reimbursement
at this time and we can provide no assurance that the Legislation will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

The Legislation also contained provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare. The Legislation amends several existing laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims
Act, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers. While Congress had previously revised the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person is
not required to “have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of” the Anti-Kickback Statute in order to be found in violation of such law, the Legislation also provides that any claims for items or services that violate
the Anti-Kickback Statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The Legislation provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil
False Claims Act, although final regulations implementing this statutory requirement remain pending. The Legislation also expands the Recovery Audit Contractor program to Medicaid. These amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties
to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations.

We have partnered with local physicians
in the ownership of certain of our facilities. These investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self-referral law. The Legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a
“grandfather” clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital. The Legislation also imposes certain
compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physician-owned hospitals and restricts the ability of physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities.

The impact of the Legislation on each of our hospitals may vary. Because Legislation provisions are effective at various times over the
next several years, we anticipate that many of the provisions in the Legislation may be subject to further revision. We cannot predict the impact the Legislation may have on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and
liquidity, or whether we will be able to successfully adapt to the changes required by the Legislation.

We are required
to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay.

In accordance with our internal
policies and procedures, as well as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor and/or seeking medical
treatment (whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay) to determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition. If it is determined that such person has an emergency medical
condition, we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patient’s medical condition, within the facility’s capability, or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in
accordance with applicable law and the treating hospital’s written procedures. Our obligations under EMTALA may increase substantially going forward; CMS has sought stakeholder comments concerning the potential applicability of EMTALA to
hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively, but has yet to issue further guidance in response to that request. If the number of indigent and charity care



patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly, or if regulations expanding our obligations to inpatients under EMTALA is proposed and adopted, our results of
operations will be harmed.

If we are not able to provide high quality medical care at a reasonable price, patients may
choose to receive their health care from our competitors.

In recent years, the number of quality measures that
hospitals are required to report publicly has increased. CMS publishes performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals submit in connection with the Medicare program. Federal law provides for the
future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported. Additionally, the Legislation requires all hospitals to annually establish, update and make public a list of their standard charges for products and services. If any of our
hospitals achieve poor results on the quality measures or patient satisfaction surveys (or results that are lower than our competitors) or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, our patient volume could decline because patients may
elect to use competing hospitals or other health care providers that have better metrics and pricing. This circumstance could harm our business and results of operations.

An increase in uninsured and underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations.

Collection of receivables from third-party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our
operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill that is the patient’s responsibility, which primarily includes co-payments and deductibles. However, we also have substantial
receivables due to us as of December 31, 2013 (a significant portion of which is past due) from certain state-based funding programs, most particularly Illinois and Texas as discussed herein. We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts
based on general factors such as payor mix, the agings of the receivables, historical collection experience and assessment of probability of future collections. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and
other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted. Significant changes in business office operations, payor mix, economic conditions or trends in
federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flow and results of operations. If we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt
expenses, our results of operations will be harmed.

Our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals
and health care providers.

The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals, and other
healthcare providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years. In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals. Some of our
competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sales and income taxes. Such exemptions and
support are not available to us.

In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better
equipped and offer a broader range of services than we. The number of inpatient facilities, as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers, many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians, in the geographic areas in which we operate
has increased significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment.

If our
competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities, we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business
may be harmed.



Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.

Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient
treatment. As a result, the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends, in part, on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of
good relations with those physicians. Physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals, and, in a number of our markets, physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. They may terminate their
affiliation with us at any time. If we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards, adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged
from referring patients to our facilities and our results of operations may decline.

It may become difficult for us to
attract and retain an adequate number of physicians to practice in certain of the non-urban communities in which our hospitals are located. Our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could
make it more difficult to attract patients to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Generally, the top ten attending physicians within each of our facilities represent a large share of our inpatient revenues and admissions. The loss of one or more of these physicians, even if temporary,
could cause a material reduction in our revenues, which could take significant time to replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and retaining physicians.

If we do not continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment,
our ability to maintain and expand our markets will be adversely affected.

The technology used in medical equipment
and related devices is constantly evolving and, as a result, manufacturers and distributors continue to offer new and upgraded products to health care providers. To compete effectively, we must continually assess our equipment needs and upgrade when
significant technological advances occur. If our facilities do not stay current with technological advances in the health care industry, patients may seek treatment from other providers and/or physicians may refer their patients to alternate
sources, which could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business.

If we fail to effectively and
timely implement electronic health record systems, our operations could be harmed.

As required by HITECH, we are in
the process of developing and implementing an incentive payment program for eligible hospitals and health care professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology. If our facilities or physicians are unable to
meet the requirements for participation in the incentive payment program, we will not be eligible to receive incentive payments that could offset some of the costs of implementing an electronic health record system. Further, beginning in federal
fiscal year 2015, eligible hospitals and professionals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record technology will be subject to reduced payments from Medicare. Any failure by us to effectively implement an
electronic health record system in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our
performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations.

We depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab
technicians and other healthcare professionals. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.



The nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant
operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers. This shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel. In addition,
in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels. To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets, which would have a
corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.

We cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the
future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff. If our general labor and related expenses increase, we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly. Our failure to either recruit and retain qualified
hospital management, nurses and other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations.

Increased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs. Union organizing activities and certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase
the likelihood of employee unionization in the future, to the extent a greater portion of our employee base unionized, it is possible our labor costs could increase materially.

If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to
make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability.

The healthcare industry is
required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things: hospital billing practices and prices for services; relationships with physicians and other
referral sources; adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services; ownership of facilities; qualifications of medical and support personnel; confidentiality, maintenance, privacy and security issues associated with
health-related information and patient medical records; the screening, stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions; certification, licensure and accreditation of our facilities; operating policies and procedures,
and; construction or expansion of facilities and services.

Among these laws are the federal False Claims Act, the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (“HIPAA”), the federal anti-kickback statute and the provision of the Social Security Act commonly known as the “Stark Law.” These laws, and particularly the anti-kickback
statute and the Stark Law, impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities, including employment contracts,
leases and professional service agreements. We also provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals. The Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health
and Human Services, or OIG, has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti-kickback statute. A number of our current arrangements, including financial relationships with
physicians and other referral sources, may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the anti-kickback statute. Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti-kickback statute, but may subject the
arrangement to greater scrutiny. We cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti-kickback statute. CMS recently published a Medicare self-referral disclosure protocol, which is intended to
allow providers to self-disclose actual or potential violations of the Stark law. Because there are only a few judicial decisions interpreting the Stark law, there can be no assurance that our hospitals will not be found in violation of the Stark
Law or that self-disclosure of a potential violation would result in reduced penalties.

Federal regulations issued under
HIPAA contain provisions that require us to implement and, in the future, may require us to implement additional costly electronic media security systems and to adopt new business practices designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our
patient’s health and related financial information. Such privacy and security regulations impose extensive administrative, physical and technical



requirements on us, restrict our use and disclosure of certain patient health and financial information, provide patients with rights with respect to their health information and require us to
enter into contracts extending many of the privacy and security regulatory requirements to third parties that perform duties on our behalf. Additionally, recent changes to HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance requirements, including
obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.

These laws and regulations are extremely complex, and, in many cases, we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation. In the future, it is possible that different interpretations or
enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and
operating expenses. A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws (see

Item 3-Legal Proceedings

), or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state
level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be. See

Item 1 Business—Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation

.

If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we
could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other
federal and state healthcare programs. The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We are subject to occupational health, safety and other similar regulations and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business and results of operations.

We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Regulatory requirements
affecting us include, but are not limited to, those covering: (i) air and water quality control; (ii) occupational health and safety (e.g., standards regarding blood-borne pathogens and ergonomics, etc.); (iii) waste management;
(iv) the handling of asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and radioactive substances; and (v) other hazardous materials. If we fail to comply with those standards, we may be subject to sanctions and penalties that could harm our business
and results of operations.

We may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities.

We are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits, product liability lawsuits, class action lawsuits and other legal
actions in the ordinary course of business. Some of these actions may involve large claims, as well as significant defense costs. We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us. In an
effort to resolve one or more of these matters, we may choose to negotiate a settlement. Amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material. All professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations. We
believe that, based on our past experience and actuarial estimates, our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals. While we continuously monitor our coverage, our ultimate liability for
professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates. If such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future, or payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our
insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

We may be subject to governmental investigations,
regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits

The federal False Claims Act permits private parties to bring qui tam,
or whistleblower, lawsuits against companies. Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government



alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of
whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years. Because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal, we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware. Please see

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

for disclosure of current related matters.

The failure of certain employers, or
the closure of certain facilities, could have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals.

The economies in the
non-urban communities in which our hospitals operate are often dependent on a small number of large employers. Those employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on
our hospitals and other health care facilities for their care. The failure of one or more large employer or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at facilities located in or near the communities where our
hospitals operate, could cause affected employees to move elsewhere to seek employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them. The occurrence of these events could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations,
thereby harming our business.

If any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new
facilities fail to receive accreditation, such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid.

The construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel,
operating policies and procedures, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection. Additionally, such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued
compliance with these various standards.

All of our hospitals are deemed certified, meaning that they are accredited,
properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the Medicare program. The effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We believe
that all of our healthcare facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local and other relevant regulations and standards. However, should any of our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose
certification under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected.

Our growth strategy depends, in part, on acquisitions, and we may not be able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our target
criteria. We may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from not-for-profit entities due to regulatory scrutiny.

Acquisitions of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy. We face competition for acquisition candidates
primarily from other for-profit healthcare companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do. Also, suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms.

In addition, many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that affect the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals
to for-profit entities. These laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification and community involvement. In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise
discretionary authority over such transactions. Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a
not-for-profit entity sells a healthcare facility to a for-profit entity. The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation, increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential
purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals, increase our acquisition costs or make it difficult for us to acquire hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria, any of which could adversely affect our growth
strategy and results of operations.



Further, the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of
operations, depending on various factors, including the amount paid for the acquisition, the acquired hospital’s results of operations, allocation of the purchase price, effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases.

We may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire, which could harm our results of
operations and adversely affect our growth strategy.

We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the
hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations. We may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals. Integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our
ongoing business, negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel. In addition, acquisition activity requires transitions from, and the integration of, operations and, usually, information systems that are used by
acquired hospitals. In addition, some of the hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition. If we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire,
operate such hospitals profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals, our results of operations could be harmed.

If we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities, we could become liable for material obligations.

Hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Although we typically attempt
to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for
the past activities of hospitals we acquire. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs and/or resulting damage to a facility’s reputation could harm our business.

Our subsidiaries, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions.

Our subsidiaries, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions (see

Item 3-Legal Proceedings

).

State efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care
facilities could impair our ability to expand.

Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted
Certificates of Need, or CON, laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services. Our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to
complete a particular hospital acquisition, expansion or replacement, make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, result in the revocation of a facility’s license or impose civil or criminal
penalties on us, any of which could harm our business.

In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of
states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements. In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the
impact of these changes upon our operations.

Controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues.

Controls imposed by third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as
“utilization review,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. Inpatient



utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize
outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. Although we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our operations,
significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

Our revenues and volume trends may be adversely affected by certain factors over which we have no control.

Our revenues and volume trends are dependent on many factors, including physicians’ clinical decisions and availability, payor
programs shifting to a more outpatient-based environment, whether or not certain services are offered, seasonal and severe weather conditions, including the effects of extreme low temperatures, hurricanes and tornados, earthquakes, current local
economic and demographic changes. In addition, technological developments and pharmaceutical improvements may reduce the demand for healthcare services or the profitability of the services we offer.

Fluctuations in our operating results, quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in decreases in the price of our
common stock.

The stock markets have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to operating performance.
These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and, as a result, there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock. If we are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we
have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future, the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when it becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be
realized.

In addition to our operating results, many economic and seasonal factors outside of our control could have an
adverse effect on the price of our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings. These factors include certain of the risks discussed herein, demographic changes, operating results of other hospital companies, changes in our
financial estimates or recommendations of securities analysts, speculation in the press or investment community, the possible effects of war, terrorist and other hostilities, adverse weather conditions, the level of seasonal illnesses, managed care
contract negotiations and terminations, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, or other developments affecting the health care industry.

We are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price.

As a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002. While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory
requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations. For example, we cannot provide assurance that, in the future, our management will not find a material weakness in
connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other
sanctions or litigation. If we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our stock price could decline.



A cyber security incident could cause a violation of HIPAA, breach of member privacy,
or other negative impacts.

A cyber-attack that bypasses our information technology (“IT”) security systems
causing an IT security breach, loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws, loss of proprietary business information, or a material disruption of our IT business systems, could have a material adverse impact on our
business and result of operations. In addition, our future results of operations, as well as our reputation, could be adversely impacted by theft, destruction, loss, or misappropriation of public health information, other confidential data or
proprietary business information.

Different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Generally accepted accounting principles are complex,
continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us, our independent registered public accounting firm and the SEC. Such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances.
Differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

We continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor. Such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects.

The cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased. As we continue to invest in modern
technologies, emergency rooms and operating room expansions, the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care, we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or
borrowed funds. Although we evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital, such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues
to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained.

The deterioration of credit and capital markets
may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed.

We require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation, expansion, construction and addition of medical equipment and
technology. We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We cannot predict, however, whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us
on satisfactory terms when needed, which could harm our business.

To fund all or a portion of our future financing needs, we
rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate, long-term debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program. If any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future
commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding. In the event we need to access the capital markets or other
sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.



We depend heavily on key management personnel and the departure of one or more of our
key executives or a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could harm our business.

The
expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of our local hospital management personnel are critical to the success of our business. The loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or of a significant portion of
our local hospital management personnel could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient, quality healthcare services at our facilities, which could harm our business.

The number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock is subject to potential increases or decreases.

At December 31, 2013, 25.7 million shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of
Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans. Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share
basis into Class B Common Stock. To the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of Class B Common Stock, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock available for trading in the public market place would increase
substantially and the current holders of Class B Common Stock would own a smaller percentage of that class.

In addition, from
time-to-time our Board of Directors approve stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. Such repurchases
decrease the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock. Conversely, as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business, we may from time-to-time issue equity through the sale of stock which would
increase the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock. Based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the market price of our stock, interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash, repurchase or issuance of our
stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings per share.

The right to elect the majority
of our Board of Directors and the majority of the general shareholder voting power resides with the holders of Class A and C Common Stock, the majority of which is owned by Alan B. Miller, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board
of Directors.

Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, with respect to the election of directors,
holders of Class A Common Stock vote as a class with the holders of Class C Common Stock, and holders of Class B Common Stock vote as a class with holders of Class D Common Stock, with holders of all classes of our Common Stock entitled to one
vote per share.

As of March 21, 2013, the shares of Class A and Class C Common Stock constituted 6.9% of the
aggregate outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect five members of the Board of Directors and constituted 86.2% of our general voting power. As of March 21, 2013, the shares of Class B and Class D Common Stock (excluding
shares issuable upon exercise of options) constituted 93.1% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect two members of the Board of Directors and constituted 13.8% of our general voting power.

As to matters other than the election of directors, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that holders of Class A,
Class B, Class C and Class D Common Stock all vote together as a single class, except as otherwise provided by law.

Each
share of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote; each share of Class B Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one-tenth of a vote; each share of Class C Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to 100 votes (provided
the holder of Class C Common Stock holds a number of shares of



Class A Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that holder holds); and each share of Class D Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes
(provided the holder of Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class D Common Stock that holder holds).

In the event a holder of Class C or Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively,
less than ten times the number of shares of Class C or Class D Common Stock that holder holds, then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of Class C Common Stock, or one-tenth of a vote for every share of Class D Common
Stock, which that holder holds in excess of one-tenth the number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, held by that holder. The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory
evidence that such owner holds ten times as many shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock as Class C or Class D Common Stock, respectively, if such facts are not apparent from our stock records.

Since a substantial majority of the Class A shares and Class C shares are controlled by Mr. Alan B. Miller and members of
his family who are also directors and officers of our company, and they can elect a majority of our company’s directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders, there are
potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of our company.

In addition, because this concentrated control
could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, our business and prospects and the trading price of our securities could be adversely
affected.

In October, 2007, the licenses for Edinburg Regional Medical Center/Children’s Hospital, McAllen Medical Center, McAllen Heart Hospital and South Texas Behavioral
Health Center were consolidated under one license operating as the South Texas Health System.

(5)

We manage and own a noncontrolling interest of approximately 50% in the entity that operates this facility.

(6)

We own a majority interest in an LLC that owns and operates this center.

(7)

We own minority interests in an LLC that owns and operates this center which is managed by a third-party.

(8)

We own a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 50% in the entity that operates this facility that is managed by a third-party.

(9)

We hold an 89% ownership interest in this facility through both general and limited partnership interests. The remaining 11% ownership interest is held by unaffiliated
third parties.

(10)

Land of this facility is leased.

We own or lease medical office buildings adjoining some of our hospitals. We believe that the leases on the facilities, medical office
buildings and other real estate leased or owned by us do not impose any material limitation on our operations. The aggregate lease payments on facilities leased by us were $60 million in 2013, $53 million in 2012 and $55 million in 2011.

ITEM 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to litigation, as outlined below.

Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) and Other Government Investigations

In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of
Justice (“DOJ”) advising of a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (“ICDs”) from 2003 to 2010 at several of our acute care facilities. The
DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a National Coverage Determination regarding these devices. We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In July, 2012, one of our subsidiaries, Peachford Behavioral Health System of Atlanta
located in Atlanta, Georgia, received a subpoena from the OIG for the Department of Health and Human Services requesting various



documents. We have provided all requested documents. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we were notified that the governmental agencies investigating this matter had declined to proceed.

In February, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena requesting various documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena
directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. (“UHS”) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and several UHS owned facilities including: Keys of Carolina, Old Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood
Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a, The Pines Residential Treatment Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and
Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health. Prior to receiving this subpoena: (i) the Keys of Carolina and Old Vineyard received notification during the second half of 2012 from the United States
Department of Justice of its intent to proceed with an investigation following requests for documents for the period of January, 2007 to October, 2012 from the North Carolina state Attorney General’s Office; (ii) Harbor Point Behavioral
Health Center received a subpoena in December, 2012 from the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Virginia requesting various documents from July, 2006 to the date of the subpoena, and; (iii) The Meadows Psychiatric Center received a
subpoena from the OIG in February, 2013 requesting certain documents from 2008 to the date of the subpoena. Unrelated to these matters, the Keys of Carolina was closed and the real property was sold in January, 2013. In April, 2013, the OIG served
facility specific subpoenas on Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting various documents from January, 2005 to the date of the subpoena. In June, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena on Coastal Harbor Health System in Savannah,
Georgia requesting documents from January, 2009 to the date of the subpoena. In July, 2013, another subpoena was issued to Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting additional records. We have been advised by the DOJ’s
Criminal Frauds Section that they have received a referral from the DOJ Civil Division and have opened an investigation of River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center. In February, 2014, we were notified that the investigation conducted
by the Criminal Frauds Section has been expanded to include the National Deaf Academy. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigations, liability of the facilities and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in
connection with these matters.

Matters Relating to PSI:

The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.) which were in
existence prior to the acquisition of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010:

Garden City Employees’ Retirement System v. PSI:

This is a purported
shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against PSI and the former directors in 2009 alleging violations of federal securities laws. We intend to defend the case vigorously.
Should we be deemed liable in this matter, we believe we would be entitled to commercial insurance recoveries for amounts paid by us, subject to certain limitations and deductibles. Included in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,
2013 and 2012, is an estimated reserve (current liability) and corresponding commercial insurance recovery (current asset) which did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Although we believe the commercial insurance recoveries are
adequate to satisfy potential liability and related legal fees in connection with this matter, we can provide no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed the commercial insurance recoveries which would make us liable for the excess.

Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:

In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the
facility. The requested documents have been collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination. Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July 2011 requesting additional documents, which have been collected and delivered to the
DOJ. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.



Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital:

In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010. The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility
and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.

Virginia Department of Medical Assistance
Services Recoupment Claims:

The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (“DMAS”) has conducted audits
at seven former PSI Residential Treatment Centers operated in the Commonwealth of Virginia to confirm compliance with provider rules under the state’s Medicaid Provider Services Manual (“Manual”). As a result of those audits, DMAS
claims the facilities failed to comply with the requirements of the Manual and has requested repayment of Medicaid payments to those facilities. PSI had previously filed appeals to repayment demands at each facility which are currently pending. We
had previously agreed to a settlement of this matter which was approved by Virginia state officials during the first quarter of 2014. The aggregate refund of Medicaid payments made to those facilities, as requested by DMAS, and the settlement amount
is not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

General:

The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government
healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or
allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers. Currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive
notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies. Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected
to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. We monitor all aspects of our business and have
developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or
litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced
with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a
material adverse effect on us.

The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations,
including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities. We record accruals for such
contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be
made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the
proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute;
(vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes. It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position,
cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.



In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business
are pending. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Our principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers. As
of February 27, 2014, we owned and/or operated 24 acute care hospitals and 193 behavioral health centers located in 37 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As part of our ambulatory treatment centers division, we
manage and/or own outright or in partnerships with physicians, 5 surgical hospitals and surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 4 states. In October, 2012, we acquired Ascend Health Corporation (“Ascend”). Ascend was the largest
private behavioral health provider with 9 owned or leased freestanding inpatient facilities located in 5 states.

During the
first quarter of 2012, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2011-07, “Health Care Entities (Topic 954): Presentation and Disclosure of Patient Service Revenue,
Provision for Bad Debts, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for Certain Health Care Entities,” which required certain health care entities to change the presentation in their statement of operations by reclassifying the provision for bad
debts associated with patient service revenue from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenue (net of contractual allowances and discounts). As a result, the provision for doubtful accounts for our acute care and behavioral
health care facilities is reflected as a deduction from net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for 2013, 2012 and 2011. The adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial position or overall results of
operations.

Net revenues from our acute care hospitals, surgical hospitals, surgery centers and radiation oncology centers
accounted for 49% of our consolidated net revenues in 2013, 50% in 2012 and 51% in 2011. Net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities accounted for 50% of our consolidated net revenues during 2013, 50% during 2012 and 49% during 2011.

Services provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care,
radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services. We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing,
information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors

This Annual Report
contains “forward-looking statements” that reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, the
information concerning our possible future results of operations, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expectations that regulatory developments or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial
condition, our competitive position and the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industry in which we operate, and the benefits and synergies to be obtained from our completed and any future acquisitions, and statements of our goals
and objectives, and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “predicts,” “potential,”
“continue,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “appears,” “projects” and similar expressions, as well
as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements. In evaluating those statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risks related to healthcare industry trends and those set forth herein in

Item 1A Risk Factors.

Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or
results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with



respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Such factors
include, among other things, the following:

•

our ability to comply with the existing laws and government regulations, and/or changes in laws and government regulations;

•

an increasing number of legislative initiatives have recently been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system
on a national or state level. No assurances can be given that the implementation of these new laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations;

•

possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government programs, including Medicare
or Medicaid;

•

an increase in the number of uninsured and self-pay patients treated at our acute care facilities that unfavorably impacts our ability to
satisfactorily and timely collect our self-pay patient accounts;

•

our ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same, including contracts
with United/Sierra Healthcare in Las Vegas, Nevada;

•

the outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, false claim act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against
us, including matters as disclosed in

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

;

•

the potential unfavorable impact on our business of deterioration in national, regional and local economic and business conditions, including a
continuation or worsening of unfavorable credit market conditions;

•

competition from other healthcare providers (including physician owned facilities) in certain markets, including McAllen/Edinburg, Texas, the site of
one of our largest acute care facilities and Riverside County, California;

•

technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for healthcare;

•

our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor expenses
resulting from a shortage of nurses and other healthcare professionals;

•

demographic changes;

•

our ability to successfully integrate and improve our recent acquisitions and the availability of suitable acquisitions and divestiture opportunities;

•

as discussed below in

Sources of Revenue

, we receive revenues from various state and county based programs, including Medicaid in all the states
in which we operate, (we receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of Texas, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Illinois, Virginia and Massachusetts); CMS-approved Medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including
Oklahoma, California and Arkansas, and; state Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including Texas and South Carolina. We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state based
revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. We can provide no assurance that reductions to revenues earned pursuant to these programs, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not
have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;

•

our ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms, including borrowed funds, to fund the future growth of our business;

•

some of our acute care facilities continue to experience decreasing inpatient admission trends;



•

our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors and there can be no assurance that failure of the payors
to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;

•

in March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were enacted into law and
created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs. The two combined primary goals of these acts are to provide for increased access to
coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses. Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade. We cannot predict the effect, if any, these enactments
will have on our future results of operations;

•

the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published final regulations in July, 2010 implementing the health information technology
(“HIT”) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the
requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the
state Medicaid programs. Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
Certain of our acute care hospitals implemented EHR applications in 2011 and 2012 and we continued the implementation at each of our acute care hospitals, on a facility-by-facility basis, until completion which occurred in June, 2013. Our acute care
hospitals are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application, once they have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable stage or have completed attestations to
their adoption or implementation of certified EHR technology. With the exception of the newly constructed Temecula Valley Hospital, which was opened in October, 2013, we believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the stage 1, year one
“meaningful use” criteria. Although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the EHR standards by 2015, there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the
penalty provision of the HITECH Act. Should we (our acute care hospitals) qualify for incentive payments, there may be timing differences in the recognition of the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the
EHR applications which may cause material period-to-period changes in our future results of operations;

•

in August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) was enacted into law. The 2011 Act imposed annual spending limits for most
federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional
committee, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the “Joint Committee”), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare
payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year (approximately $35 million annual reduction to our Medicare net revenues effective as of April 1, 2013) with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. We cannot predict
whether Congress will restructure the implemented Medicare payment reductions or what other federal budget deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress;

•

Our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 includes amounts due from Illinois of approximately $49 million,
$70 million and $54 million, respectively. Collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures. Approximately $28 million as of December 31, 2013, $51 million as of
December 31, 2012 and $41 million as of December 31, 2011, of the receivables due from Illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of



each respective date. In addition, our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2013 includes approximately $46 million due from Texas in connection with Medicaid supplemental payment
programs the majority of which we expect to collect during the second quarter of 2014. Although the accounts receivable due from Illinois and Texas could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all
amounts due to us (we have received $27 million of cash remittances from Illinois in January, 2014), no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements. However, we can provide no assurance that we will
eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois and/or Texas. Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from these states would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows;

•

the ability to obtain adequate levels of general and professional liability insurance on current terms;

•

changes in our business strategies or development plans;

•

fluctuations in the value of our common stock, and;

•

other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Given these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, as outlined above, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such
forward-looking statements. Our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. We
assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except as may be required by law. All forward-looking
statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

A summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in Note 1 to the financial statements. We consider our critical
accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements, including the following:

Revenue recognition:

We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided. Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 38% of our net
patient revenues during 2013, 39% during 2012 and 41% during 2011. Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 49% of our net patient revenues during each
of 2013 and 2012 and 47% during 2011.

We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from
patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered. We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates. Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates
per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. We closely monitor our
historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available. However, due to the complexities involved in these
estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.

We estimate our Medicare
and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations. The laws and regulations governing the
Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded



estimates will change by material amounts in the near term. Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare
Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements. Such amounts are included in
accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes. As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and
regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2013, 2012
or 2011. If it were to occur, each 1% adjustment to our estimated net Medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of December 31, 2013, would change our after-tax net income by approximately $1 million.

We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less
than our established rates. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net. See additional disclosure below in

Charity Care and Uninsured
Discounts in Acute Care Hospital Services

for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.

A portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of Medicaid accounts that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other
miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states. Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient’s responsible party at the time of registration. At that time, an insurance
eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned. There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the
insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered. Certain patients may be classified as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible. When
a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending our patient accounting system records net revenues for the services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates pending ultimate disposition of the
patient’s Medicaid eligibility. Based on general factors as discussed below in

Provision for Doubtful Accounts

, our acute care facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be
uncollectible. Such estimated uncollectible amounts related to Medicaid pending, as well as other accounts receivable payer classifications, are considered when the overall individual facility and company-wide reserves are developed. Adjustments
related to the final determination of these accounts did not materially impact our results of operations in 2013, 2012 or 2011.

Provision for Doubtful Accounts:

Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash
and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient’s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles. We estimate our provisions for
doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which
might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted. At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the
patient account. For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters. Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed
for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy. If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.

Uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of a minimum of 30% of total
charges. Our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for



doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old. All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge. Third party
liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge. Potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay.

On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts
provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience. Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $395 million and $311 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Approximately 90% during 2013 and 87% during 2012 of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts, was incurred by our acute care
hospitals. Shown below is our payer mix concentrations and related aging of our billed accounts receivable, net of contractual allowances, for our acute care hospitals as of December 31, 2013 and 2012:

As of December 31, 2012:

Accounting for Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Records Incentive Payments:

In July 2010,
the Department of Health and Human Services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic
Health Records (“EHR”) and established the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and
can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated
“meaningful use” of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.

Medicare EHR incentive payments:

Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed
based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable “meaningful use” requirements. Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on
December 31

st

, we will recognize Medicare EHR
incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the “meaningful use” criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.



Medicaid EHR incentive payments:

Medicaid EHR incentive payments are determined based
upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the “meaningful use” criteria. Therefore, the majority of the Medicaid EHR incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable
hospitals were deemed to have met initial “meaningful use” criteria. Upon meeting subsequent fiscal year “meaningful use” criteria, our hospitals may become entitled to additional Medicaid EHR incentive payments which will be
recognized as incentive income in future periods. Medicaid EHR incentive payments received prior to our hospitals meeting the “meaningful use” criteria were included in other current liabilities (as deferred EHR incentive income) in our
consolidated balance sheet.

Self-Insured Risks:

We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and
professional liability claims and workers’ compensation claims. Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and
reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial
insurance policies. All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability
claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate. Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized
currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense. Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted
against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

Professional and General Liability
and Workers Compensation Liability:

Effective January 1, 2008, most of our subsidiaries became self-insured for
professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence. Prior to our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (“PSI”) in November, 2010, our subsidiaries purchased several excess policies through commercial
insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of $10 million up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. However, we are liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million
up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.

Prior to our acquisition in November, 2010, the PSI subsidiaries were
commercially insured for professional and general liability insurance claims in excess of a $3 million self-insured retention to a limit of $75 million. PSI utilized its captive insurance company and that captive insurance company remains
in place after our acquisition of PSI to manage the self-insured retention for all former PSI subsidiaries for claims incurred prior to January 1, 2011. The captive insurance company also continues to insure all professional and general
liability claims, regardless of date incurred, for the former PSI subsidiaries located in Florida and Puerto Rico.

Since our
acquisition of PSI on November 15, 2010, the former PSI subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $3 million per occurrence and our legacy subsidiaries (which are not former PSI subsidiaries) are
self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence. Effective November, 2010, our subsidiaries (including the former PSI subsidiaries) were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance
carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence self-insured retention (either $3 million or $10 million) up to $250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to
the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. The 9 behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012 have general and professional
liability policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for up to $20 million of aggregate coverage, subject to a $25,000 per occurrence deductible. These facilities, like our other facilities, are also provided excess coverage
through commercial insurance carriers for coverage in excess of the underlying commercial policy limitations up to $250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.



Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based
on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based
on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from
our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate. Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or
severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

As of
December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $206 million, of which $44 million is included in current liabilities. As of December 31, 2012, the total accrual for our professional and general
liability claims was $279 million, of which $48 million is included in current liabilities.

We recorded reductions to our
professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $81 million during 2013, $27 million during 2012 and $11 million during 2011. The favorable change in our estimated future claims payments recorded
during 2013, relating to years prior to 2013, were due primarily to: (i) an increased weighting given to company-specific metrics (to 100% from 75%), and decreased general industry metrics (to 0% from 25%), related to projected incidents per
exposure, historical claims experience and loss development factors; (ii) historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate, and; (iii) a
decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years. As the number of our facilities and our patient volumes
have increased, thereby providing for a statistically significant data group, and taking into consideration our long-history of company-specific risk management programs and claims experience, our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on
our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends. The favorable change recorded during 2012 resulted from favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments
pursuant to a reserve analysis. The favorable change recorded during 2011 consisted primarily of third-party recoveries and reserve reductions in connection with PHICO–related claims which we became liable for upon PHICO’s (a former
commercial insurance carrier) liquidation in 2002.

As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our workers’
compensation liability claims was $64 million, of which $34 million is included in current liabilities. As of December 31, 2012, the total accrual for our workers’ compensation liability claims was $66 million, of which $35 million is
included in current liabilities. The adjustments recorded during the last three years to our prior year reserves for workers’ compensation claims did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended
December 31, 2013, 2012 or 2011.

Although we are unable to predict whether or not our future financial statements will
include adjustments to our prior year reserves for self-insured general and professional and workers’ compensation claims, given the relatively unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the factors impacting these reserves, as
discussed above, it is reasonably likely that our future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves.



Below is a schedule showing the changes in our general and professional liability and
workers’ compensation reserves during the three years ended December 31, 2013 (amount in thousands):

(a)

General and professional liability amounts are net of adjustments recorded during each year, as discussed above.

In addition, we also maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims. The ultimate costs
related to these programs include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.

Property Insurance:

Property Insurance:

We have commercial property insurance policies
covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence, subject to a $250,000 deductible for the majority of our properties (the properties acquired from Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. are subject to a
$50,000 deductible). Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property. In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses
resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses). Our earthquake limit is $250 million, subject to a deductible of $250,000, except for facilities located within documented
fault zones. Earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the United States are subject to a $100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million, subject to a $25,000 deductible. Non-critical flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility. Since certain of our facilities have been
designated by our insurer as flood prone, we have elected to purchase policies from The National Flood Insurance Program to cover a substantial portion of the applicable deductible.

Due to an increase in property losses experienced nationwide in recent years, our catastrophic coverage for earthquake and flood has been
limited to annual aggregate losses (as opposed to per occurrence losses). There can be no assurance that a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained by us, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.



Long-Lived Assets:

We review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets,
for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate
of its undiscounted future cash flow. If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values are determined
based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.

Goodwill and Intangible
Assets:

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment
indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit. We have designated September 1

st

as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2013 which
indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. There were also no impairments during 2012 or 2011. Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value
projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.

We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws. We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities. Our tax returns
have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) through the year ended December 31, 2006. We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.

three years.

Results of Operations

The following table summarizes our results of operations, and is used in the discussion below, for the years ended December 31,
2013, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands):

Year Ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012:

Net revenues increased 5% or $322 million to $7.28 billion during 2013 as compared to $6.96 billion during 2012. The
increase was primarily attributable to:

•

a $239 million or 4% increase in net revenues generated at our acute care hospitals and behavioral health care facilities owned during both periods
(which we refer to as “same facility”), and;

•

other combined net increase of $83 million consisting primarily of the net revenues generated during the first ten months of 2013 at nine behavioral
health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012 (the operating results for these facilities for the months of November and December of 2013 and 2012 are included in our behavioral health care facilities-same facility basis
results).

Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests)
increased $106 million to $869 million during 2013 as compared to $764 million during 2012. Included in our income before income taxes during 2013, as compared to 2012, was the following:

2012 of which $23 million was applicable to our acute care hospitals and $4 million was applicable to our behavioral health facilities);

d.

a decrease of $33 million (net of related expenses) resulting from the pre-tax income recorded during 2012 related to an agreement, which was part of an industry-wide
settlement related to underpayments of Medicare inpatient prospective payments during a number of prior years, entered into with the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services;

e.

a decrease of $26 million resulting from a gain realized on the sale of an acute care hospital (Auburn Regional Medical Center) which was sold during the fourth quarter
of 2012;

f.

an increase of $29 million resulting from the write-off deferred financing costs, during 2012, related to the portion of our Term Loan B credit facility that was
extinguished during the third quarter of 2012;

g.

an increase of $33 million due to a decrease in interest expense resulting primarily from a decrease in our average effective borrowing rate during 2013 as compared to
2012 (as discussed below in

Interest Expense

);

h.

a net aggregate increase of $11 million resulting from the following unfavorable items recorded during 2012: (i) the revised Supplemental Security Income ratios
utilized for calculating Medicare disproportionate share hospital reimbursements for federal fiscal years 2006 through 2009 ($7 million unfavorable impact), and; (ii) the write-off of receivables related to revenues recorded during 2011 at two
of our acute care hospitals located in Florida resulting from reductions in certain county reimbursements due to reductions in federal matching Inter-Governmental Transfer funds ($4 million unfavorable impact);

i.

a decrease of $14 million resulting from the 2011 portion, recorded in 2012, of net Medicaid supplemental reimbursements earned pursuant to new programs initiated in
certain states in which we operate behavioral health facilities, most notably the Oklahoma Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program which was approved during 2012, retroactive to July 1, 2011;

j.

an increase of $16 million related to the incentive income ($61 million in 2013 and $30 million in 2012), net of related expenses ($43 million in 2013 and $28 million
in 2012), recorded during the each year in connection with the implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals, and;

k.

$8 million of other combined net increases.

Net income attributable to UHS increased $67 million to $511 million during 2013 as compared to $443 million during 2012. The increase consisted of:

•

an increase of $106 million in income before income taxes, as discussed above;

•

an increase of $2 million resulting from a decrease in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and;

•

a decrease of $41 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from the income tax provision on the $108
million increase in pre-tax income ($106 million increase in income before income taxes plus the $2 million increase in income resulting from a decrease in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests).



Year Ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the Year Ended December 31,
2011:

Net revenues increased 3% or $201 million to $6.96 billion during 2012 as compared to $6.76 billion during 2011.
The increase was primarily attributable to:

•

a $152 million or 2% increase in net revenues generated at our acute care hospitals and behavioral health care facilities owned during both periods,
and;

•

$49 million of other combined net increases in net revenues consisting primarily of $36 million of revenues resulting from an agreement, which was part
of an industry-wide settlement related to underpayments of Medicare inpatient prospective payments during a number of prior years, entered into during the first quarter of 2012 with the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the
Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Income before
income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $67 million to $764 million during 2012 as compared to $696 million during 2011. Included in our income before income taxes during 2012, as compared to

care hospitals located in Florida resulting from reductions in certain county reimbursements due to reductions in federal matching Inter-Governmental Transfer funds ($4 million unfavorable impact);

g.

an increase of $22 million due to a decrease in interest expense resulting primarily from a decrease in our average effective interest rate (due primarily to an
amendment to our credit agreement in March of 2011 which, among other things, provided for reductions in the rates payable for borrowings outstanding under our Term Loan A, Term Loan B and revolving credit facility), as discussed below in

Interest Expense

;

h.

a net increase of $16 million resulting from reductions recorded during 2012 and 2011 to our professional and general liability reserves, as discussed above in

an increase of $67 million in income before income taxes, as discussed above;

•

an increase of $5 million resulting from a decrease in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and;

•

a decrease of $27 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from the income tax provision on the $72
million increase in pre-tax income ($67 million increase in income before income taxes plus the $5 million increase in income resulting from a decrease in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests).

Acute Care Hospital Services

Year Ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012:

Acute Care Hospitals-Same Facility Basis

The following table
summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities on a same facility basis and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollar amounts in thousands):

On a same facility basis during 2013, as compared to 2012, net revenues at our acute care hospitals
increased $129 million or 4%. Income before income taxes decreased $15 million or 5% to $277 million or 7.8% of net revenues during 2013 as compared to $291 million or 8.5% of net revenues during 2012.



Inpatient admissions to these facilities increased 0.2% during 2013, as compared to 2012,
while patient days increased 1.4%. Adjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased 1.0% and adjusted patient days increased 2.2% during 2013, as compared to 2012. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was
4.5 days during each of 2013 and 2012. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 56% during each of 2013 and 2012. On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities increased
2.7% during 2013, as compared to 2012, and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 1.5% during 2013, as compared to 2012.

All Acute Care Hospitals

The following table summarizes the results
of operations for all our acute care operations during 2013 and 2012, which includes our acute care results on a same facility basis, as well as the impact of other items as mentioned below (dollar amounts in thousands).

During 2013, as compared to 2012, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased $115 million or 3%
to $3.58 billion due primarily to an increase in same facility revenues, as discussed above.

Income before income taxes
increased $5 million to $342 million or 9.6% of net revenues during 2013 as compared to $337 million or 9.7% of net revenues during 2012.

Included in these results are the following:

•

the $15 million decrease in income before income taxes experienced during 2013, as compared to 2012, at our acute care hospitals, on a same facility
basis, as discussed above;

•

a $40 million net increase resulting from reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves attributable to our acute care
hospitals recorded during 2013 ($63 million) and 2012 ($23 million), as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

;

•

a decrease of $33 million (net of related expenses) resulting from the pre-tax income recorded during 2012 related to an agreement with the United
States Department of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;



•

a net aggregate increase of $11 million resulting from the following unfavorable items which were recorded during 2012: (i) the revised
Supplemental Security Income ratios utilized for calculating Medicare disproportionate share hospital reimbursements for federal fiscal years 2006 through 2009 ($7 million unfavorable impact), and; (ii) the write-off of receivables related to
revenues recorded during 2011 at two of our acute care hospitals located in Florida resulting from reductions in certain county reimbursements due to reductions in federal matching Inter-Governmental Transfer funds ($4 million unfavorable impact);

•

a net increase of $16 million related to the incentive income ($61 million in 2013 and $30 million in 2012), net of related expenses ($43 million in
2013 and $28 million in 2012), recorded in connection with the implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals, and;

•

a net other combined decrease of $14 million consisting primarily of the operating losses incurred at a Temecula Valley Hospital, a newly constructed
140-bed acute care facility located in Temecula, California that was completed and opened in October of 2013.

Year Ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2011:

Acute Care Hospitals-Same Facility Basis

The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities on a same facility basis and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011
(dollar amounts in thousands):

On a same facility basis during 2012, as compared to 2011, net revenues at our acute care hospitals
increased $14 million or less than 1%. Income before income taxes decreased $52 million or 15% to $291 million or 8.5% of net revenues during 2012 as compared to $343 million or 10.0% of net revenues during 2011.

Inpatient admissions to these facilities decreased 2.0% during 2012, as compared to 2011, while patient days decreased 1.7%. Adjusted
admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased 0.2% and adjusted patient days increased 0.5% during 2012, as compared to 2011. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.5 days during each of 2012 and 2011. The
occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 56% during 2012 and 58% during 2011. On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted



admission at these facilities increased 0.2% during 2012, as compared to 2011, and net revenue per adjusted patient day decreased 0.1% during 2012, as compared to 2011.

The decrease in income before income taxes and pressure on patient volumes, net revenues and net revenue per adjusted admission and
adjusted patient day experienced at our acute care hospitals during 2012, as compared to 2011, were largely due to a decline in organic revenue growth caused by the continuing trends of weak demand and deteriorating payor mix.

All Acute Care Hospitals

The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our acute care operations during 2012 and 2011, which includes our acute care results on a same facility basis, as well as the impact of
other items as mentioned below (dollar amounts in thousands).

During 2012, as compared to 2011, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased 1% or $37 million to
$3.46 billion due primarily to the above-mentioned agreement related to underpayments of Medicare inpatient prospective payments during a number of prior years and an increase in same facility revenues, as discussed above.

Income before income taxes decreased $16 million to $337 million or 9.7% of net revenues during 2012 as compared to $353 million or 10.3%
of net revenues during 2011.

Included in these results are the following:

•

the $52 million decrease in income before income taxes experienced during 2012, as compared to 2011, at our acute care hospitals, on a same facility
basis, as discussed above;

•

the $13 million net favorable effect resulting from reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves recorded during 2012
($23 million) and 2011 ($10 million), as discussed above in

Self-Insured Risks

;

•

the favorable impact of $33 million (net of related expenses) recorded during 2012 resulting from the above-mentioned agreement with the United States
Department of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;



•

a net aggregate decrease of $11 million resulting from the following items which were recorded during 2012: (i) the revised Supplemental Security
Income ratios utilized for calculating Medicare disproportionate share hospital reimbursements for federal fiscal years 2006 through 2009 ($7 million unfavorable impact), and; (ii) the write-off of receivables related to revenues recorded
during 2011 at two of our acute care hospitals located in Florida resulting from reductions in certain county reimbursements due to reductions in federal matching Inter-Governmental Transfer funds ($4 million unfavorable impact), and;

•

an increase of $2 million related to the incentive income ($30 million), net of expenses ($28 million), recorded during 2012 in connection with the
implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals.

Charity Care and Uninsured Discounts:

A significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients
which, in part, has resulted from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles. Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have
gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care. The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size. Because we do not pursue
collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net. We also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in “uninsured discounts” amounts below) who do not
qualify for Medicaid or charity care. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net. In implementing the discount policy, we first
attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.

Uncompensated care:

The following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012
and 2011:

In addition, the provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals were approximately $1.02
billion during 2013, $635 million during 2012 and $519 million during 2011.

The estimated cost of providing
uncompensated care:

The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a
calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts. The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based
on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities. An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in



the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.

Sources of Revenue

Overview:

We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal
government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians
and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services. Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g.,
medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control. The percentage of patient service revenue
attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare,
Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis. We believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in
the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues.

Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services
under Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions,
deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year. Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from
governmental or business payers and we continue to experience an increase in uninsured and self-pay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts thereby increasing our provision for doubtful accounts and charity care
provided.

The significant portion of our revenues derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to
regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in Texas and Nevada. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate
effect on our overall business results.

The following tables show the approximate percentages of net patient revenue during
the past three years (excludes sources of revenues for all periods presented for divested facilities which are reflected as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements) for: (i) our Acute Care and Behavioral Health Care
Facilities Combined; (ii) our Acute Care Facilities, and; (iii) our Behavioral Health Care Facilities. Net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts from established billing
rates, which we derived from various sources of payment for the years indicated.



Medicare:

Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance
benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate
governmental authorities. Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the
Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.

Under the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”). Under the IPPS, hospitals are
paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge. The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient’s Medicare severity diagnosis related group (“MS-DRG”). Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the
estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis. The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in
providing care. This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG. The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which
a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity. While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for
an “outlier” payment if a particular patient’s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold.

MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the “hospital market basket index,”
gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services
purchased by hospitals.

In August, 2013, CMS published its final IPPS 2014 payment rule which provides for a 2.5% market
basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, we
estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2014 rule



(covering the period of October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014) will approximate 1.0%. This projected impact from the IPPS 2014 final rule includes both the impact of the American
Taxpayer Relief Act (“ATRA”) of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact
of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, as discussed below. The final rule would also expand CMS’s policy under which it defines inpatient admissions to include the use of an objective time of care standard.
Specifically, it would require Medicare’s external review contractors to presume that hospital inpatient admissions are reasonable and necessary when beneficiaries receive a physician order for admission and receive medically necessary services
for at least two midnights (the “Two Midnight” rule). Correspondingly, under the final rule, CMS would presume that hospital services spanning less than two midnights should have been provided on an outpatient basis and paid under Medicare
Part B unless the medical record contains clear documentation supporting the physician’s order and an expectation that the Medicare beneficiary would need medically necessary care for more than two midnights, or is receiving services which CMS
designates as inpatient only. Our acute care hospitals have begun to comply with the Two Midnight rule and, although we are unable to determine the ultimate impact at this time, its application could have a material unfavorable impact on our future
results of operations. Excluding the potential impact of the Two Midnight rule, we do not expect the final IPPS 2014 payment rule to have a material impact on our future results of operations. In February, 2014, CMS extended a policy an additional
six months where Recovery Auditor Contractors and other Medicare review contractors will not conduct post-payment patient status reviews of inpatient hospital claims with dates of admission on or after October 1, 2013 through September 30,
2014.

In August, 2012, CMS published its final IPPS 2013 payment rule which provided for a 2.6% market basket increase to the
base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, we estimate our overall
increase from the final federal fiscal year 2013 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013) approximated 1.8%. The impact from the IPPS 2013 final rule reflects all of the adjustments described in this
paragraph, however, it excludes the impact of potential reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, as discussed below.

In August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) was enacted into law. Included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs
aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint
Committee, which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011
deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year (approximately $35 million
annual reduction to our Medicare net revenues effective as of April 1, 2013) with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs.

On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted which, among other things, includes a requirement for CMS to recoup $11 billion from hospitals from Medicare IPPS rates during
federal fiscal years 2014 to 2017. The recoupment relates to IPPS documentation and coding adjustments for the period 2008 to 2013 for which adjustments were not previously applied by CMS. The 2014 IPPS final rule includes a -0.8% recoupment
adjustment as the first step in this recovery process. CMS expects to make similar adjustments in federal fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017 in order to recover the entire $11 billion. This adjustment is reflected in the 2014 IPPS estimated impact
amount noted above.

On January 1, 2005, CMS implemented a new Psychiatric Prospective Payment System (“Psych
PPS”) for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program. This system replaced the cost-based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem Psych PPS with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient
characteristics. The Psych PPS also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. In April, 2011 CMS



published its final Psych PPS rule for the fifteen month period July 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012. The market basket increase for this time period was 2.95%, which included a 0.25%
reduction required by the federal Health Care Reform legislation enacted in 2010. In August, 2012, CMS published its final Psych PPS rate notice for the federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2012. That final notice contained a Psych PPS
market basket update of 2.7%, which was reduced by 0.7% to reflect a productivity adjustment, and reduced by 0.1% to reflect an “other adjustment” required by the Social Security Act for rate years 2010 through 2019. In July, 2013, CMS
released its final Psych PPS rate notice for the federal fiscal year 2014. The final notice contains a Psych PPS market basket update of 2.6% which is reduced by 0.5% to reflect a productivity adjustment, and reduced by 0.1% to reflect an
“other adjustment” required by the Social Security Act.

In December, 2013, CMS published its annual final Medicare
Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“OPPS”) rule for 2014. The final hospital market basket increase is 2.5%. The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.3% reduction to the 2014 OPPS market basket
reducing the final 2014 OPPS market basket update to 1.7%. In the final rule, CMS reduced the 2014 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs. When other statutorily required
adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS for 2014 will aggregate to a net increase of 1.4%. Excluding the behavioral health division
partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2014 is estimated to be 2.5%.

In November, 2012,
CMS published its annual final Medicare OPPS rule for 2013. The market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.6%. In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to
reduce the update factor by 0.1% in federal fiscal year 2013 and to reduce the annual update by a productivity adjustment which is 0.7%. In the final rule, CMS is also implementing a significant increase in the 2013 Medicare rates for both
hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs. When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, our overall Medicare
OPPS payment increase for 2013 is estimated to be 3.5%. Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2013 was approximately 1.7%.

In November, 2011, CMS published its annual final Medicare OPPS rule for 2012. The market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 3.0%.
In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.1% in federal fiscal year 2012 and to reduce the annual update by a productivity
adjustment which is 1.1%. In the final rule, CMS also implemented a significant decrease in the 2012 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs. When other statutorily required
adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS payment decrease for 2012 was estimated to be approximately 0.7%. Excluding the behavioral health partial
hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2012 was approximately 2.1%.

We entered into an agreement
in April, 2012 with the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and CMS (referred to collectively as “HHS”) that resulted in an aggregate cash payment to us of approximately $36
million which was received during 2012. After reductions for estimated related expenses and the portion attributable to third-party non-controlling ownership interests, this settlement favorably impacted our 2012 pre-tax consolidated financial
results by approximately $30 million (recording during the first quarter of 2012). This agreement was part of an industry-wide settlement with HHS related to litigation that was pending for several years contending that acute care hospitals in
the U.S. were underpaid from the Medicare inpatient prospective payment system during a number of prior years. The underpayments resulted from calculations related to rural floor budget neutrality adjustments that were implemented in connection with
the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.



Medicaid:

Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that
is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals.
Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our
revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid. All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate
governmental authorities.

We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of Texas, Pennsylvania,
Washington, D.C., Illinois, Virginia and Massachusetts, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs (which have been implemented in various forms with respect to our areas of operation in the
respective 2013 state fiscal years) as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. Based upon the state budgets for the 2013 fiscal year (which generally began at various times during the second half of
2012), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates were reduced by approximately 1% (or approximately $15 million annually) from the average rates in effect during the states’ 2012 fiscal years (which generally ended
during the third quarter of 2012). Based upon the state budgets for the 2014 fiscal year (which will generally began at various times during the second half of 2013), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates will remain
relatively unchanged from the 2013 fiscal year rates.

The Affordable Care Act substantially increases the federally and
state-funded Medicaid insurance program, and authorizes states to establish federally subsidized non-Medicaid health plans for low-income residents not eligible for Medicaid starting in 2014. However, the Supreme Court has struck down portions of
the Affordable Care Act requiring states to expand their Medicaid programs in exchange for increased federal funding. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that states in which we operate will expand Medicaid coverage to individuals at 133% of the
federal poverty level. Facilities in states not opting to expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act may be additionally penalized by corresponding reductions to Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments, as discussed
below. We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

Certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas (Hidalgo, Maverick, Potter and Webb) participate in CMS-approved
private Medicaid supplemental payment (“UPL”) programs. These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties. Our
hospitals receive both UPL payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals. The UPL payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer
(“IGT”) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals. We recorded net UPL and affiliated hospital indigent care revenues of $61 million during
2013, $25 million during 2012 and $31 million during 2011. If the applicable hospital district or county makes IGTs consistent with 2013 levels, and without giving effect to potential reductions resulting from the February, 2013 THHSC proposed rule,
which is discussed below, we believe we would be entitled to aggregate net revenues earned pursuant to these programs of approximately $54 million during the state fiscal year state 2014 which ends on September 30, 2014.

For state fiscal year 2014, Texas Medicaid will continue to operate under a CMS-approved Section 1115 five-year Medicaid waiver
demonstration program. During the first five years of this program that started in state fiscal year 2012, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (“THHSC”) transitioned away from UPL payments to new waiver incentive payment
programs. During the first year of transition, which commenced on October 1, 2011, THHSC made payments to Medicaid UPL recipient providers that received payments during the state’s prior fiscal year. During transition years two
through five, THHSC will make incentive payments under the program after certain qualifying criteria are met by hospitals. UPL payments are also subject to an aggregate



statewide caps based on CMS approved Medicaid waiver amounts. In February, 2013, THHSC proposed a rule that indicates that any required statewide UPL payment reductions will be applied a pro rata
basis to all UPL payment recipients. Although our future UPL payments in Texas may be adversely impacted by this proposed rule, we are unable to estimate the potential impact on us since the amount of the statewide pro rata UPL payment reduction, if
any, has not yet been determined by THHSC.

We incur health-care related taxes (“Provider Taxes”) imposed by states
in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items of services, or; (iii) the payment
for the health care items or services. Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching dollars as part of their respective
state Medicaid programs. We derive a related Medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments. Including the impact of the California,
Oklahoma, Indiana and Ohio programs that were initiated during 2013 or 2012, as mentioned below, we earned an aggregate net benefit of approximately $69 million during 2013, $58 million during 2012 (of which $12 million related to 2011) and $26
million during 2011 from Medicaid supplemental payments, after assessed Provider Taxes were considered. We estimate that our aggregate net benefit from Provider Tax programs will approximate $46 million during 2014. The aggregate net benefit is
earned from multiple states and therefore no particular state’s portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements. However, Provider Taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative
changes that, if reduced from current rates in several states, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated future results of operations.

In California, a Medicaid state plan amendment (“SPA”) was submitted to CMS by the state requesting and extension of a prior provider tax and related Medicaid supplemental payment program
retroactive to July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013. In June, 2012, CMS approved a portion of the SPA which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during 2013 or 2012. In June, 2013, CMS approved the
Medicaid managed care component of the SPA covering the period of July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2013. The net aggregate benefit for the period of July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2013 was $11 million (of which $8 million was
applicable to prior years) which was included in our financial results during the second quarter of 2013. The SPA noted above covering the six month period July 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013 is still subject to CMS approval. Similarly,
in October, 2013 the state of California enacted new legislation (SB 239) that would continue the provider tax and related Medicaid supplemental payment program for three years effective January 1, 2014 and likewise is subject to CMS
approval. As such, if these CMS approvals are obtained by the state, the program impact will be retroactive to July 1, 2013. Although we cannot predict whether or not CMS will ultimately approve these additional programs (covering the
period of July 1, 2013 through December 31, 2016), if approved by CMS, we estimate the average pre-tax favorable impact on our results of operations to be approximately $10 million annually.

In January, 2012, the state of Oklahoma was granted federal approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”)
for the Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program (“SHOPP”) which grants the Oklahoma Health Care Authority the authority to assess a 2.5% fee on certain Oklahoma hospitals and to make Medicaid supplemental payments to hospitals through
December 31, 2014, retroactive to July 1, 2011. The state finalized the initial supplemental payment program amounts in March, 2012 and our 2012 pre-tax consolidated financial results were favorably impacted by approximately $21 million in
connection with the SHOPP program covering the period of July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012.

During the second
quarter of 2012, new supplemental Medicaid programs were initiated in Indiana and Ohio in which we operate behavioral health care facilities. Our 2012 pre-tax consolidated financial results were favorably impacted by approximately $14 million
recorded in connection with these programs which were retroactive to July, 2011.



State Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments:

Hospitals that have an
unusually large number of low-income patients (i.e., those with a Medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean Medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are eligible to
receive a disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) adjustment. Congress established a national limit on DSH adjustments. Although this legislation and the resulting state broad-based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive
under the Medicaid program, to date the net impact has not been materially adverse.

Upon meeting certain conditions and
serving a disproportionately high share of Texas’ and South Carolina’s low income patients, five of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina received additional reimbursement from each state’s DSH
fund. The South Carolina and Texas DSH programs were renewed for each state’s 2014 DSH fiscal year (covering the period of October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014). In September, 2013, the THHSC published its 2013 final DSH rule
that included changes that resulted in approximately $9 million of additional reimbursements to our acute care facilities located in Texas applicable to the state’s 2013 fiscal year (which were included in our 2013 pre-tax consolidated
financial results). In connection with these DSH programs, included in our financial results was an aggregate of $54 million during 2013, $47 million during 2012 and $45 million during 2011. Assuming that the Texas and South Carolina programs are
renewed for each state’s 2015 fiscal years, at amounts similar to the 2014 fiscal year estimates, we estimate our aggregate reimbursements pursuant to these programs to be approximately $49 million during 2014. Failure to renew these DSH
programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary IGTs for the states’ share of the DSH programs, failure of our hospitals that currently receive DSH payments to qualify for future DSH
funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements (see below), could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

The Affordable Care Act provides for a significant reduction in Medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in 2016 (see below in

Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform-Medicaid
Revisions

for additional disclosure). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is to determine the amount of Medicaid DSH payment cuts imposed on each state based on a defined methodology. As Medicaid DSH payments to states will be cut,
consequently, payments to Medicaid-participating providers, including our hospitals in Texas and South Carolina, will likely be reduced in the coming years. Based on the September, 2013 CMS final rule, our Medicaid DSH payments in Texas and South
Carolina could be reduced by approximately 4% in the 2016 federal fiscal year. This statutorily required reduction was originally scheduled to be implemented in federal fiscal year 2014 but was delayed to FFY 2016 by the Pathway for SGR Reform Act
of 2013.

In May, 2013 the state of Texas enacted legislation that would increase the state’s contribution of the
non-federal DSH share for the 2013 DSH year to $138 million as compared to the $100 million previously expected. Similarly, the state’s approved 2014-2015 General Appropriations bill passed in May, 2013 authorized $160 million for 2014 and $140
million for 2015, respectively, for the non-federal DSH share. We expect the 2014 and 2015 DSH year amounts to be comparable to the 2013 DSH year amounts.

HITECH Act:

In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published final regulations implementing the health information technology (“HIT”) provisions of
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and
Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria. The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can
end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but we expect that all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate
will ultimately choose to participate. Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the “meaningful use” criteria. The government’s ultimate
goal is to promote more effective (quality) and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all Americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system.



During 2011, we began implementing EHR applications at certain of our acute care hospitals
and continued to do so, on a hospital-by-hospital basis, until completion which occurred at the end of June, 2013. Our acute care hospitals are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application,
once they have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable stage or have completed attestations to their adoption or implementation of certified EHR technology. With the exception of the newly constructed and recently
opened Temecula Valley Hospital, we believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the stage 1, year one meaningful use criteria.

Our 2013 consolidated results of operations includes a favorable pre-tax impact of approximately $19 million consisting of approximately $61 million of EHR incentive income less approximately $10 million
of salaries, wages, benefits and other operating expenses, approximately $33 million of depreciation and amortization expense, plus approximately $1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. Our 2012 consolidated results of
operations includes a favorable pre-tax impact of approximately $3 million consisting of approximately $30 million of EHR incentive income less approximately $15 million of salaries, wages, benefits and other operating expenses, approximately $13
million of depreciation and amortization expense, plus approximately $1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable
“meaningful use” requirements. Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31

st

, we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the
facility meets the “meaningful use” criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.

Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the IPPS standardized
amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. Although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the EHR standards by 2015, there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not
subject to the penalty provision of the HITECH Act.

Managed Care:

A significant portion of our net patient
revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs. In general, we
expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow. The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in
which we operate. Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors
including managed care companies.

Commercial Insurance:

Our hospitals also provide services to individuals
covered by private health care insurance. Private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital’s established charges and the particular
coverage provided in the insurance policy. Private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor.

Commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms,
including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services. To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers’ reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to
their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.

Other Sources:

Our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage. Such patients
are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based



upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals’ indigent and charity care policy. Patients without
health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.

Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform:

Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of
Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, the War on
Terrorism, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, the expansion of a Medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the
future. We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.

In March, 2010, the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872, P.L. 111-152), (the “Reconciliation Act”) and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), (the “Affordable Care Act”), were enacted into law and created
significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs. Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at
various times during this decade are noted below.

Implemented Medicare Reductions and Reforms:

•

The Reconciliation Act reduced the market basket update for inpatient and outpatient hospitals and inpatient behavioral health facilities by 0.25% in
each of 2010 and 2011, by 0.10% in each of 2012 and 2013.

•

The Affordable Care Act implemented certain reforms to Medicare Advantage payments, effective in 2011.

•

A Medicare shared savings program, effective in 2012.

•

A hospital readmissions reduction program, effective in 2012.

•

A value-based purchasing program for hospitals, effective in 2012.

•

A national pilot program on payment bundling, effective in 2013.

•

Reduction to Medicare disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) payments, effective in 2014, as discussed above.

Medicaid Revisions:

•

Expanded Medicaid eligibility and related special federal payments, effective in 2014.

•

The Affordable Care Act (as amended by subsequent federal legislation) requires annual aggregate reductions in federal DSH funding from federal fiscal
year (“FFY”) 2016 through FFY 2023. The aggregate annual reduction amounts are:

$1.2

billion for FFY 2016

$1.8

billion for FFY 2017

$5.0

billion for FFY 2018

$5.6

billion for FFY 2019

$4.0

billion for FFY 2020

$4.0

billion for FFY 2021



$4.0

billion for FFY 2022

$4.0

billion for FFY 2023

Health Insurance Revisions:

•

Large employer insurance reforms, effective in 2015.

•

Individual insurance mandate and related federal subsidies, effective in 2014.

•

Federally mandated insurance coverage reforms, effective in 2010 and forward.

The Affordable Care Act will seek to increase competition among private health insurers by providing for transparent federal and state
insurance exchanges starting in 2014. The Affordable Care Act also prohibits private insurers from adjusting insurance premiums based on health status, gender, or other specified factors. We cannot provide assurance that these provisions will not
adversely affect the ability of private insurers to pay for services provided to insured patients, or that these changes will not have a negative material impact on our results of operations going forward.

Value-Based Purchasing:

There is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable
adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition,
Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events. Many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable
adverse events.

The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing. The
Affordable Care Act prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions (“HAC”). Beginning in FFY 2015, hospitals that fall into the top
25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments. Hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by HHS will receive reduced payments for all
inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard.

The
Affordable Care Act also required HHS to implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on October 1, 2012. The Affordable Care Act requires HHS to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all
discharges by a percentage beginning at 1% in FFY 2013 and increasing by 0.25% each fiscal year up to 2% in FFY 2017 and subsequent years. HHS will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or
exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS. HHS will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions. In its
fiscal year 2014 IPPS final rule, CMS will fund the 2014 value-based purchasing program by reducing base operating DRG payment amounts to participating hospitals by 1.25%.

Readmission Reduction Program:

In the Affordable Care Act, Congress
also mandated implementation of the hospital readmission reduction program (“HRRP”). The HRRP assesses penalties on hospitals having excess readmission rates when compared to expected rates, effective for discharges beginning
October 1, 2012. In the fiscal year 2013 IPPS final rule,



CMS finalized certain policies with regard to payment under the HRRP, including which hospitals are subject to the HRRP, the methodology to calculate the hospital readmission payment adjustment
factor, and what portion of the IPPS payment is used to calculate the readmission adjustment factor. In the fiscal year 2014 IPPS final rule, CMS finalized revisions to the three 30-day admission measures in the program – heart failure,
myocardial infarction, and pneumonia – to exclude planned readmissions. Under the Affordable Care Act, beginning in fiscal year 2015, CMS will expand the program and add two readmission measures, one, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) and, two, patients admitted for elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We do not believe impact of HRRP for federal fiscal years 2013 and 2014 had or will have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations.

Accountable Care Organizations:

The Affordable Care Act requires HHS to establish a Medicare Shared Savings Program that promotes accountability and coordination of care
through the creation of accountable care organizations (“ACOs”). The ACO program allows providers (including hospitals), physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure
and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. The program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards
established by HHS will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program.

In addition to
statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations,
post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our
facilities. The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers’ rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical
reimbursement provisions. We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments. Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either
inadequate or more than ultimately required.

Finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage
reimbursement levels and cost controls. Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.

Other Operating Results

Combined net revenues and income/losses before income taxes from our surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers did not have a material impact on our consolidated
results of operations during 2013, 2012 or 2011.



Interest Expense

Below is a schedule of our interest expense during 2013, 2012 and 2011 (amounts in thousands):

(a.)

The $200 million, 6.75% Senior Notes matured on November 15, 2011 and were repaid utilizing funds borrowed under our revolving credit facility.

(b.)

During September, 2012, we completed a second amendment to our credit agreement dated November, 15, 2010, as amended. The second amendment provided for a new $900
million Term Loan A-2 with a final maturity date of August 15, 2016. This amendment also extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility and the existing Term Loan A by nine months to also mature on August 15, 2016. We used
$700 million of the Term Loan A-2 proceeds to repay our higher priced Term Loan B facility. The remainder of the new Term Loan A-2 proceeds was used to pay transaction-related fees and expenses and to repay other floating rate debt.

(c.)

During May, 2013 we completed a third amendment to our credit agreement dated November 15, 2010, as amended. The third amendment provides for a reduction in the
interest rates payable in connection with certain borrowings under the credit agreement. Specifically, we replaced our existing $745.9 million senior secured Tranche B term loan with a new senior secured Tranche B-1 term loan in the same amount on
substantially the same terms as the Tranche B term loan, other than lower interest rates. Borrowings under the Tranche B-1 term loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, of one, two, three or six month LIBOR, plus an
applicable margin of 2.25% or ABR plus an applicable margin of 1.25%. The minimum LIBOR and ABR rates for the Tranche B term loan of 1.0% and 2.0%, respectively, were eliminated.

Interest expense decreased $33 million during 2013 to $146 million as compared to $179 million during 2012. The decrease was due
primarily to: (i) a $21 million decrease in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit and demand notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program due primarily to a decrease in our aggregate average cost of
borrowings pursuant to these facilities, as discussed below; (ii) a $5 million decrease in the amortization of financing fees, and; (iii) other combined net decrease of $7 million consisting primarily of interest earned by us on delayed
cash remittances paid to us from Illinois.

The aggregate average outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement
(consisting of the revolving credit, Term Loan A, Term Loan B/B-1 and Term Loan A2 facilities), demand notes and accounts receivable securitization program were $2.9 billion during each of 2013 and 2012. The average effective interest rate on these
facilities, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 2.2% during 2013 and 2.9% during 2012. The average effective interest rate on



these facilities, including amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 3.6% during 2013 and 4.5% during 2012.

Interest expense decreased $22 million during 2012 to $179 million as compared to $201 million during 2011. The decreased interest
expense during 2012 was due primarily to: (i) a $29 million decrease in interest expense due primarily to a decrease in our average effective borrowing rate (due in part to the repayment of the $200 million, 6.75% Senior Notes in November,
2011, utilizing borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit agreement which are borrowed at a lower interest rate and, as mentioned above in (a.)), the extinguishment (during the third quarter of 2012) of $700 million of borrowings pursuant to our
Term Loan B with proceeds from the new Term Loan A2 which are borrowed at a lower interest rate; (ii) a $5 million decrease in interest expense due to an increase in interest being capitalized on major construction projects, partially offset
by; (iii) a $12 million increase in interest expense due to an increase in our net interest rate swap expense.

The
aggregate average outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement (consisting of the revolving credit, Term Loan A, Term Loan B and Term Loan A2 facilities), demand notes and accounts receivable securitization program were $2.9 billion during each
of 2012 and 2011. The average effective interest rate on these facilities, including amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 4.5% during 2012 and 4.6% during 2011. The
average effective interest rate on these facilities, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 2.9% during 2012 and 3.4% during 2011.

Transaction Costs

During 2012, we incurred approximately $6 million of transaction costs in connection with our acquisition of 9 behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012. These
costs consisted primarily of legal, investment banking and consulting fees. There were no material transaction fees incurred in 2013 or 2011.

Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates

The effective
tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands):




Provision for income taxes

Outside owners hold various noncontrolling, minority ownership interests in seven of our acute care
facilities and one behavioral health care facility. Each of these facilities are owned and operated by limited liability companies (“LLC”) or limited partnerships (“LP”). As a result, since there is no income tax liability
incurred at the LLC/LP level (since it passes through to the members/partners), the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests does not include any income tax provision/benefit. When computing the provision for income taxes, as reflected on
our consolidated statements of income, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is deducted from income before income taxes since it represents the third-party members’/partners’ share of the income generated by the
joint-venture entities. In addition to providing the effective tax rates, as indicated above (as calculated from dividing the provision for income taxes by the income before income taxes as reflected on the consolidated statements of income), we
believe it is helpful to our investors that we also provide our effective tax rate as calculated after giving effect to the portion of our pre-tax income that is attributable to the third-party members/partners.



The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the
difference in income before income taxes, minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands):

The impact of the discrete tax items did not have a material impact on our provision for income taxes
during 2013, 2012 or 2011.

Discontinued Operations

In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) in connection with our
acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in October of 2012, we agreed to certain conditions, including the divestiture of Peak Behavioral Health Services (“Peak”), a 104-bed behavioral health care facility located in Santa Teresa, New
Mexico. The divestiture of Peak was completed during the second quarter of 2013 for total cash proceeds of approximately $24 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 million which is included in our 2013 consolidated financial
statements.

In October of 2012, we completed the divestiture of Auburn Regional Medical Center (“Auburn”), a
159-bed acute care hospital located in Auburn, Washington, for total cash proceeds of approximately $93 million. This divestiture resulted in a pre-tax gain of $26 million which was included in our 2012 consolidated financial statements.

In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the FTC in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November,
2010, we agreed to divest three former PSI facilities as well as one of our legacy behavioral health facilities in Puerto Rico. Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with the FTC, we divested:

•

in July, 2011, the MeadowWood Behavioral Health System, a 58-bed facility located in New Castle, Delaware;

•

in December, 2011, the Montevista Hospital (101-bed) and Red Rock Hospital (21-bed), both of which are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, and;

•

in January, 2012, the Hospital San Juan Capestrano, a 108-bed facility located in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico.

The operating results for Auburn, Peak and the three former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada are reflected as discontinued
operations during our period of ownership during each of the years presented herein. Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is not material to our consolidated financial statements, it
is included as a reduction to other operating expenses. Assets and liabilities for Peak were reflected as “held for sale” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012.



The following table shows the results of operations for Auburn and Peak and the former PSI
facilities located in Delaware and Nevada, on a combined basis, which were reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership for each of the years presented herein (amounts in thousands):

Effects of Inflation and Seasonality

Seasonality

—Our acute care services business is typically seasonal, with higher patient volumes and net patient service
revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year. This seasonality occurs because, generally, more people become ill during the winter months, which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those
months.

Inflation

—Inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years.
However, since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supply and other costs, we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to
contain future expense increases. Our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases,
limit our ability to increase prices. We believe, however, that through adherence to cost containment policies, labor management and reasonable price increases, the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable.

Liquidity

Year ended
December 31, 2013 as compared to December 31, 2012:

Net cash provided by operating activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $884 million during 2013 and $799 million during 2012. The net increase of $85 million was
primarily attributable to the following:

•

a favorable change of $93 million due to an increase in net income plus/minus depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense,
costs related to extinguished debt and gains on sales of assets and businesses;

•

a $62 million unfavorable change in accrued insurance expense, net of payments made in settlement of self-insurance claims, due primarily to the
above-mentioned reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves recorded during 2013 and 2012 ($81 million during 2013 as compared to $27 million recorded during 2012);

•

a $41 million favorable change in accrued and deferred income taxes (due in part to the tax treatment related to the above-mentioned 2013 reduction to
our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves);

•

a $22 million unfavorable change in other assets and deferred charges;

•

a $21 million favorable change in accounts receivable, and;

•

$14 million of other combined net favorable changes.



Days sales outstanding (“DSO”):

Our DSO are calculated by
dividing our net revenue by the number of days in the year. The result is divided into the accounts receivable balance the end of the year. Our DSO were 56 days at each of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and 51 days at December 31, 2011.

Net cash used in investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $383 million during 2013 as compared to $790 million during 2012.

2013:

The $383 million of net cash used in investing activities during
2013 consisted of $358 million spent on capital expenditures, $13 million spent on the acquisition of property and businesses, $37 million received from the sale of assets and businesses and $50 million spent in connection with the purchase and
implementation of an electronic health records application (“EHR”). Please see

Item 7-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-HITECH Act

for additional disclosure related to
the EHR implementation.

2013 Capital Expenditures:

During 2013, we spent $358 million to finance capital expenditures including the following:

•

the construction costs related to the newly constructed Temecula Valley Hospital, a 140-bed acute care facility located in Temecula, California, that
was completed and opened in October, 2013;

•

the construction costs related to Austin Oaks Hospital, a newly constructed, 80-bed behavioral health facility located in Austin, Texas, that was

•

$4 million of other combined net favorable changes.

equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities. Approximately $155 million of our 2014 expected capital expenditures relates to completion of projects that are in progress as of December 31, 2013.
We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated funds and/or additional funds, as discussed
below.

Capital Resources

Credit Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities

In May, 2013, we
entered into a third amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the credit agreement, dated as of November 15, 2010 (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”), which became effective that day, among UHS, the several
banks and other financial institutions from time to time parties thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and the other agents party thereto. The Third Amendment provides for a reduction in the interest rates payable in connection
with certain borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Upon the effectiveness of the Third Amendment, UHS replaced its existing $745.9 million senior secured Tranche B term loan with a new senior secured Tranche B-1 term loan in the same amount on
substantially the same terms as the Tranche B term loan, other than lower interest rates. Borrowings under the Tranche B-1 term loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, one, two, three or six month LIBOR, plus an applicable
margin of 2.25% or ABR plus an applicable margin of 1.25%. The minimum LIBOR and ABR rates for the Tranche B term loan of 1.0% and 2.0%, respectively, were eliminated.

In September, 2012, we entered into a second amendment (“Second Amendment”) to our Credit Agreement which provided for: (i) a new $900 million Term Loan-A (“Term Loan A2”) at the
same interest rates as our existing Term Loan A and a final maturity date of August 15, 2016; (ii) the extension of the maturity date on a substantial portion of our $800 million revolving credit facility commitment with $777 million of
the commitment extended to mature on August 15, 2016 and the remaining $23 million commitment scheduled to mature on November 15, 2015 (there were no borrowings outstanding pursuant to our revolving credit facility as of December 31,
2013), and; (iii) the extension of the maturity date on a substantial portion of our Term Loan-A borrowings which, based upon the outstanding Term Loan-A borrowings as of December 31, 2013, $892 million is scheduled to mature on
August 15, 2016 and the remaining $43 million is scheduled to mature on November 15, 2015. The Second Amendment also provides for increased flexibility for refinancing and certain other modifications but substantially all other terms of
the Credit Agreement remain unchanged.



In September, 2012, we used $700 million of the proceeds from the new Term Loan A2 facility
to extinguish a portion of our higher priced, Term Loan-B facility. Pricing under the new Term Loan A2 facility was 1% lower than the Term Loan-B facility and did not include a LIBOR Floor whereas, at that time, the Term Loan-B facility had a 1%
LIBOR Floor (which has since been eliminated as part of the above-mentioned Third Amendment in May, 2013). During the third quarter of 2012, in connection with the extinguishment of a portion of our Term Loan-B facility, we recorded a pre-tax charge
of $29 million to write-off the related portion of the Term Loan-B deferred financing costs.

The Credit Agreement, as
amended, is a senior secured facility which, as of December 31, 2013, provided for an aggregate commitment amount of $3.16 billion, comprised of an $800 million revolving credit facility, a $939 million Term Loan-A facility, a $550 million Term
Loan-B facility and a $872 million Term Loan-A2 facility. The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and our material
subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either
(1) the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to, at our election: the greatest of (a) the lender’s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month LIBOR rate
plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit, Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 borrowings and 1.25% for Term Loan B borrowings or
(2) the one, two, three or six month LIBOR rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% for revolving credit, Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2
borrowings and 2.25% for Term Loan-B borrowings. The current applicable margins are 0.50% for ABR-based loans, 1.50% for LIBOR-based loans under the revolving credit, Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 facilities and 2.25% under the Term Loan-B facility.

As of December 31, 2013, we had no borrowings outstanding pursuant to the terms of our $800 million revolving credit
facility and we had $755 million of available borrowing capacity, net of $25 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to a short-term, on-demand credit facility and $20 million of outstanding letters of credit.

During 2013, we made scheduled principal payments of $72 million on the Term Loan-A and Term Loan A2 facilities. Quarterly installment
payments (“Installment Payments”) are due on the Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 facilities which approximate $72 million in 2014, $77 million in 2015 and $46 million in 2016. The Installment Payments due on the Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2
facilities during 2014 are classified as current maturities of long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2013. Although no Installment Payments are due on the Term Loan-B facility, we made optional repayments of $196
million during the fourth quarter of 2013.

In October, 2013 our $275 million accounts receivable securitization program
(“Securitization”) with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks was amended to extend the maturity date to October 25, 2016 and reduce the interest rate spread and commitment fee. Substantially all of the patient-related
accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals (“Receivables”) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings. We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings. We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant
to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us. The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy
the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities. The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans
obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks. The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the
loans. At December 31, 2013, we had $240 million of outstanding borrowings and $35 million of additional capacity pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program.



Our $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes (the “Unsecured Notes”) are
scheduled to mature on October 1, 2018. The Unsecured Notes were issued on September 29, 2010 and registered in April, 2011. Interest on the Unsecured Note is payable semiannually in arrears on April 1st and October 1st of each
year. The Unsecured Notes can be redeemed in whole at anytime subject to a make-whole call at treasury rate plus 50 basis points prior to October 1, 2014. They are also redeemable in whole or in part at a price of: (i) 103.5% on or after
October 1, 2014; (ii) 101.75% on or after October 1, 2015, and; (iii) 100% on or after October 1, 2016. These Unsecured Notes are guaranteed by a group of subsidiaries (each of which is a 100% directly or indirectly owned
subsidiary of Universal Health Services, Inc.) which fully and unconditionally guarantee the Unsecured Notes on a joint and several basis, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions.

On June 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior notes which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016 (the
“7.125% Notes”). Interest on the 7.125% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 30th and December 30th of each year. In June, 2008, we issued an additional $150 million of 7.125% Notes which formed a single series with
the original 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2006. Other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to and trade interchangeably with, the 7.125% Notes which were
originally issued in June, 2006.

In connection with the entering into of the Credit Agreement on November 15, 2010, and
in accordance with the Indenture dated January 20, 2000 governing the rights of our existing notes, we entered into a supplemental indenture pursuant to which our 7.125% Notes (due in 2016) were equally and ratably secured with the lenders
under the Credit Agreement with respect to the collateral for so long as the lenders under the Credit Agreement are so secured.

The average amounts outstanding during each of years 2013, 2012 and 2011 under the current and prior Credit Agreements, demand notes and
accounts receivable securitization programs was $2.9 billion, with corresponding interest rates of 2.2%, 2.9% and 3.4% including commitment and facility fees. The maximum amounts outstanding at any month-end were $3.00 billion in 2013, $3.06 billion
in 2012 and $3.03 billion in 2011. The effective interest rate on our current and prior Credit Agreements, accounts receivable securitization programs, and demand notes, which includes the respective interest expense, commitment and facility fees,
designated interest rate swaps expense and amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts, was 3.6% in 2013, 4.5% in 2012 and 4.6% in 2011.

Our Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that include a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change
of ownership, liens and indebtedness, transactions with affiliates and dividends; and requires compliance with financial covenants including maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all required covenants as
of December 31, 2013.

The carrying values of our debt at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $3.3 billion and $3.7
billion, respectively. The fair values of our debt at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of our debt was computed based upon quotes received from financial institutions. We consider these
to be “level 2” in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with debt instruments.

Our total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 51% at December 31, 2013 and 58% at December 31, 2012.

We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay dividends and potentially repurchase shares of our common stock utilizing internally generated and additional funds. Additional funds
may be obtained through: (i) the issuance of equity; (ii) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility or through refinancing the existing revolving credit agreement, and/or; (iii) the issuance of other long-term debt. We
believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing capacity under our $800 million



revolving credit facility and access to the capital markets provide us with sufficient capital resources to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.
However, in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on
terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of
December 31, 2013 we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which totaled $85 million consisting of: (i) $69 million related to our self-insurance programs, and;
(ii) $16 million of other debt and public utility guarantees.

Obligations under operating leases for real property, real
property master leases and equipment amount to $307 million as of December 31, 2013. The real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near hospital property for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income. We sublease
space in these buildings and any amounts received from these subleases are offset against the expense. In addition, we lease four hospital facilities from the Trust with terms expiring in 2014 and 2016. These leases contain up to three 5-year
renewal options. We also lease the real property of certain facilities acquired by us in connection with the acquisition of PSI in November, 2010 and Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012.

The following represents the scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013:

(a)

Reflects borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2013 as discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(b)

Assumes that all debt outstanding as of December 31, 2013, including borrowings under our Credit Agreement, demand note and accounts receivable securitization
program, remain outstanding until the final maturity of the debt agreements at the same interest rates (some of which are floating) which were in effect as of December 31, 2013. We have the right to repay borrowings upon short notice and
without penalty, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, demand note and accounts receivable securitization program. Also includes the impact of various interest rate swap and cap agreements in effect as of December 31, 2013, as
calculated to maturity dates utilizing the applicable floating interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2013.

(c)

Estimated construction cost of a newly constructed acute care hospital located in Henderson, Nevada. We are required to build this hospital, on which construction has
not yet begun, pursuant to an agreement with a third party. In addition to this new hospital project, we had various other projects under construction as of December 31, 2013 with estimated additional cost to complete and equip of approximately $155
million. Because we can terminate substantially all of the related construction contracts at any time without paying a termination fee, these costs are excluded from the above table except for the amount contractually committed to a third-party.



(d)

Consists of: (i) $76 million related to long-term contracts with third-parties consisting primarily of certain revenue cycle data processing services for our acute
care facilities; (ii) $149 million related to the future expected costs to be paid to a third-party vendor in connection with the on-going operation of an electronic health records application (“EHR”) for each of our acute care
facilities (please see

Item 7-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Medicare

for additional disclosure); (iii) $33 million purchase commitment expected to be incurred in 2014 related
to certain equipment for our acute care hospitals, and; (iv) a $3 million liability for physician commitments expected to be paid in the future.

(e)

Reflects our future minimum operating lease payment obligations related to our operating lease agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2013 as discussed in Note
7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of the lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease and our future lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options.

(f)

Consists of $205 million of estimated future payments related to our non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan (estimated through 2088), as disclosed in

Note 8
to the Consolidated Financial Statements

, and $17 million of estimated future payments related to another retirement plan liability. Included in our other assets as of December 31, 2013 was a $3 million asset recorded in connection with the
non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan and included in other non-current liabilities as of December 31, 2013 was a $13 million liability recorded in connection with the other retirement plan.

As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $206 million, of which $44
million is included in other current liabilities and $162 million is included in other non-current liabilities. We exclude the $206 million for professional and general liability claims from the contractual obligations table because there are no
significant contractual obligations associated with these liabilities and because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments. Please see

Self-Insured Risks

above for additional
disclosure related to our professional and general liability claims and reserves.

In connection with five acute care
facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain “put rights”, that are currently
exercisable, that if exercised, require us to purchase the minority member’s interests at fair market value. The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established
thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member’s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds. In connection with a behavioral
health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and acquired by us as part of the PSI acquisition, the minority ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the
outside owner has a “put option” to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time. If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member’s interest at fair market value. As of December 31, 2013, we
believe the fair market value of the minority ownership interests in these facilities, pursuant to the terms of the put options, approximates the $218 million aggregate book value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests. We exclude the
approximate amount that we may be required to pay to repurchase these minority ownership interests from the contractual obligations table because of the uncertainty as to: (i) whether or not the put rights will actually be exercised;
(ii) the dollar amounts that would be paid if the put rights were exercised, and; (iii) the timing of such payments.

Additionally, the table above does not include $3 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as of
December 31, 2013. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for which the amounts may be utilized.



ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate. To
manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts. We account
for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried
at fair value on the balance sheet. For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for
undertaking each hedge transaction.

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an
asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) within shareholders’ equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged
transaction affects earnings. We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions. Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability. For derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.

For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge’s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the
fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.

The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from
the counterparties. We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis. We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2013 and 2012 and determined the hedges to be highly effective. We also
determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows. The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements
expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance. However, at December 31, 2013, each swap agreement entered into by us was in a net liability position which would require us to make the net settlement payments to the counterparties. We
do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

During 2011, we entered into a forward starting interest rate cap on a total notional amount of $450 million from December, 2011 to December, 2012 reducing to $400 million from December, 2012 to December,
2013 whereby we paid a premium of $740,000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 7.00% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 7.00% during the term of the cap. The three-month LIBOR never
reached 7.00% during the term of the cap, which expired in December, 2013, and therefore no payment was made to us.

We also
entered into six forward starting interest rate swaps in 2011 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $425 million and receive three-month LIBOR. Three of these swaps with a total notional amount of $225 million became effective in
March, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015. The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 1.91%. The three remaining interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of $75 million, $25 million and $100 million became effective in December, 2011 and
have corresponding fixed rates of 1.32%, 1.96% and 2.50%. The $75 million and $25 million interest rate swaps matured in December, 2012 and December, 2013, respectively, and the $100 million interest rate swap is scheduled to mature in December,
2014.



During 2010, we entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we pay a
fixed rate on a total notional amount of $600 million and receive three-month LIBOR. Each of the four swaps became effective in December, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015. The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 2.38%.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, we entered into two interest rate swaps whereby we paid a fixed rate on a total notional principal
amount of $150 million and received three-month LIBOR. Each of the two interest rate swaps, which are now expired, had an initial notional principal amount of $75 million. The fixed rate payable on one of the interest rate swaps was 4.87% and it
matured in October, 2011. The fixed rate payable on the other interest rate swap, on which the notional principal amount reduced to $50 million in October, 2010, was 4.76% and it matured in October, 2012.

We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on
quotes from banks. We consider those inputs to be “level 2” in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities. The fair value of our
interest rate swaps was a liability of $24 million at December 31, 2013, of which $19 million is included in other current liabilities and $5 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet. At
December 31, 2012, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $41 million, substantially all of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.

The table below presents information about our long-term financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of
December 31, 2013. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

Maturity Date, Fiscal Year Ending December 31

(Dollars in
thousands)

As calculated based upon our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2013 that is subject
to interest rate fluctuations, each 1% change in interest rates would impact our pre-tax income by approximately $17 million.

ITEM 9A.

Controls and Procedures.

As of December 31, 2013, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), we
performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by management on a timely basis in order to comply with our disclosure obligations under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, and the SEC rules thereunder.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the fourth
quarter of 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over our financial reporting. In order
to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria on

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework (1992),

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Based on its
assessment, management has concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992),

issued by the COSO. The
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which appears herein.

UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES, INC.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Universal Health Services, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Universal Health Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based
on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial
statements, financial statement schedule, and for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in item 9A as

Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control
over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1) BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Services provided by our hospitals, all of which are operated by subsidiaries of ours include general and specialty
surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services. We, through our subsidiaries, provide capital resources as
well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and
public relations.

The more significant accounting policies follow:

A) Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majority-owned
subsidiaries and partnerships controlled by us or our subsidiaries as the managing general partner. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

B) Revenue Recognition:

We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are
provided. Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 38% of our net patient revenues during 2013, 39% during 2012 and 41% during 2011. Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid
programs accounted for 49% of our net patient revenues during each of 2013 and 2012 and 47% during 2011.

We report net
patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered. We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our
established rates. Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms
specified in the related contractual agreements. We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate
information available. However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.

We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid
payment rules and regulations. The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change
by material amounts in the near term. Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to
retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements. Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funding of
both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes. As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare
and Medicaid reimbursements. Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2013, 2012 or 2011.

We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our
established rates. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net. See additional disclosure below in

Charity Care and Uninsured Discounts

for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.



C) Provision for Doubtful Accounts:

Collection of receivables from
third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient’s responsibility, primarily
co-payments and deductibles. We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in
conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted. At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts
are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account. For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection
letters. Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy. If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an
outside collection agency for additional collection effort.

Uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are
extended an uninsured discount of a minimum of 30% of total charges. Our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90
days old. All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge. Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
Potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay.

Our accounts receivable
as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 includes amounts due from Illinois of approximately $49 million, $70 million and $54 million, respectively. Collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and
funding pressures. Approximately $28 million as of December 31, 2013, $51 million as of December 31, 2012 and $41 million as of December 31, 2011, of the receivables due from Illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective
date. In addition, our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2013 includes approximately $46 million due from Texas in connection with Medicaid supplemental payment programs the majority of which we expect to collect during the second quarter of
2014. Although the accounts receivable due from Illinois and Texas could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us (we have received $27 million of cash remittances from Illinois in
January, 2014), no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements. However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois and/or Texas. Failure to ultimately collect
all outstanding amounts due from these states would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience. Our
accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $395 million and $311 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

D) Concentration of Revenues:

Our five majority owned acute care hospitals in the Las Vegas, Nevada market contributed, on a combined basis, 14% of our consolidated net revenues in each of
2013 and 2012 and 15% in 2011. On a combined basis, our facilities in the McAllen/Edinburg, Texas market (consisting of three acute care facilities, a children’s hospital and a behavioral health facility) contributed 4% of our consolidated net
revenues in each of 2013 and 2012 and 5% in 2011.

E) Charity Care and Uninsured Discounts:

A significant portion of
the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with
relatively high deductibles. Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care. The federal poverty guidelines are established by
the federal government and are based on income and family size. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net. We also provide discounts to
uninsured patients (included in “uninsured discounts” amounts



below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our
accounts receivable, net. In implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs,
the uninsured discount is applied.

Uncompensated care:

The following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at
established rates, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:

In addition, the provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals were approximately $1.02
billion during 2013, $635 million during 2012 and $519 million during 2011.

The estimated cost of providing
uncompensated care:

The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a
calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts. The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based
on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities. An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for
doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.

F) Accounting for Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Records Incentive Payments:

In July
2010, the Department of Health and Human Services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The regulation defines the “meaningful use” of
Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and established the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal
year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals
have demonstrated “meaningful use” of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.

Medicare EHR incentive payments:

Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on
the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the



applicable “meaningful use” requirements. Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31

st

, we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital
during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the “meaningful use” criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.

Medicaid EHR incentive payments:

Medicaid EHR incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the “meaningful
use” criteria. Therefore, the majority of the Medicaid EHR incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable hospitals were deemed to have met initial “meaningful use” criteria. Upon meeting subsequent fiscal
year “meaningful use” criteria, our hospitals may become entitled to additional Medicaid EHR incentive payments which will be recognized as incentive income in future periods. Medicaid EHR incentive payments received prior to our hospitals
meeting the “meaningful use” criteria were included in other current liabilities (as deferred EHR incentive income) in our consolidated balance sheet.

G) Cash and Cash Equivalents:

We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

H) Property and Equipment:

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements are
charged to the property accounts. Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred. We remove the cost and the related accumulated depreciation from the accounts for
assets sold or retired and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations. Construction-in-progress includes both construction projects and equipment not yet placed into service.

We capitalize interest expense on major construction projects while in progress. We capitalized interest on major construction projects
and the development and implementation of electronic health records applications amounting to $4.9 million during 2013, $5.7 million during 2012 and $400,000 during 2011.

Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements (twenty to forty years) and equipment (three to fifteen years). Depreciation expense
(excluding discontinued operations) was $285.6 million during 2013, $270.5 million during 2012 and $262.1 million during 2011.

I) Long-Lived Assets:

We review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash
flow. If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash
flows using appropriate discount rates.

J) Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

Goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market
conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit. We have designated September 1

st

as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2013 which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. There were
also no impairments during 2012 or 2011. Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of
a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.



Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2013
were as follows (in thousands):

(a)

The reduction to the Behavioral Health Services’ goodwill consists primarily of a reclassification to “assets of facilities held for sale” and represents
the goodwill attributable to Peak Behavioral Health Services which we agreed to divest pursuant to our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012. Adjustments to prior
year purchase price allocations for Acute Care and Behavioral Health Services are also included.

(b)

The increase in the Behavioral Health Services’ goodwill consists primarily of an amount that was reclassified from other assets.

K) Other Assets:

Other assets consist primarily of amounts related to: (i) intangible assets acquired in connection
with our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (“PSI”) in November, 2010 and Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012, consisting of Medicare licenses, certificates of need and contracts to manage the operations of behavioral health
services owned by third-parties (PSI only); (ii) prepaid fees for various software and other applications used by our hospitals; (iii) costs incurred in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records
application for each of our acute care facilities; (iv) deposits; (v) investments in various businesses, including Universal Health Realty Income Trust; (vi) the invested assets related to a deferred compensation plan that is held by
an independent trustee in a rabbi-trust and that has a related payable included in other noncurrent liabilities; (vii) the estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments, as discussed below, and;
(viii) other miscellaneous assets. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $97 million and $99 million, respectively.

L) Physician Guarantees and Commitments:

As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, our accrued liabilities-other, and our other
assets included $3 million, as of each respective date, of estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments. The $3 million of potential future financial obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2013 are
potential 2014 obligations.

M) Self-Insured Risks:

We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and
professional liability claims and workers’ compensation claims. Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and
reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial
insurance policies. All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability
claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate. Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized
currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense. See Note 8 for discussion of adjustments to our prior year reserves for claims related to our self-insured general and professional liability and workers’ compensation liability.



In addition, we also maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee
healthcare and dental claims. The ultimate costs related to these programs include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.

N) Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible
in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded
valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.

We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying
tax laws. We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities. Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) through the year ended December 31, 2006. We believe that adequate accruals have been
provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.

See Note 6—

Income Taxes,

for additional disclosure.

O) Other Noncurrent Liabilities:

Other noncurrent liabilities include the long-term portion of our professional and
general liability, workers’ compensation reserves, pension and deferred compensation liabilities, liability incurred in connection with split-dollar life insurance agreements on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife and interest
rate swap liabilities.

P) Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interest:

Outside owners
hold noncontrolling, minority ownership interests of: (i) approximately 28% in our five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada; (ii) 20% in an acute care facility located in Washington, D.C.; (iii) approximately 11% in an
acute care facility located in Laredo, Texas, and; (iv) 20% in a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balances of $218 million and $234 million as of December 31,
2013 and 2012, respectively, and the noncontrolling interest balances of $50 million and $53 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, consist primarily of the third-party ownership interests in these hospitals.

In connection with the five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected
as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain “put rights”, that are currently exercisable, that if exercised, require us to purchase the minority member’s interests at fair
market value. The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or;
(iii) if the minority member’s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds. In connection with the behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the minority ownership interest of which is also
reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owner has a “put option” to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time. If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the
minority member’s interest at fair market value. As of December 31, 2013, we believe the fair market value of the minority ownership interests in these facilities, pursuant to the terms of the put options, approximates the book value of
the redeemable noncontrolling interests.

Q) Comprehensive Income and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income:

Comprehensive income or loss is comprised of net income, changes in unrealized gains or losses on derivative financial instruments and a pension liability.

The accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) component of stockholders’ equity includes: net unrealized gains and losses on effective cash flow hedges; and the net minimum pension
liability of a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan which covers employees at one of our subsidiaries. See Note 10, “Pension Plan” for additional disclosure regarding the defined benefit pension plan.



The amounts recognized in AOCI for the two years ended December 31, 2013 were as
follows (in thousands):

R) Accounting for Derivative Financial Investments and Hedging Activities:

We manage our
ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate. To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to
exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.

We account for
our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at
fair value on the balance sheet. For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for
undertaking each hedge transaction.

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an
asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) within stockholders’ equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged
transaction affects earnings.

We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions. Such derivatives are
designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are
recognized currently in the income statement.

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure
to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value
of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item in the income statement.

For hedge transactions that do not qualify for
the short-cut method, at the hedge’s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows



of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.

S) Stock-Based Compensation:

At December 31, 2013, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans. Pursuant
to the FASB’s guidance, we expense the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation pursuant to the straight-line method over the stated vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The expense associated with share-based compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge. In the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows, share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities. The applicable FASB guidance requires that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost
recognized be classified as financing cash flows.

T) Earnings Per Share:

Basic earnings per share are based
on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year adjusted to give effect to common stock equivalents.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, for the periods indicated:

The “Net effect of dilutive stock options and grants based on the treasury stock method”, for
all years presented above, excludes certain outstanding stock options applicable to each year since the effect would have been anti-dilutive. The excluded weighted-average stock options totaled 4,000 during 2013, 2.0 million during 2012,
1.4 million during 2011.

U) Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The fair values of our registered debt
and investments are based on quoted market prices. The fair values of other long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are estimated by discounting cash flows using period-end interest rates and market conditions for instruments with
similar maturities and credit quality. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings approximates their fair values due to the short-term



nature of these instruments. Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the fair value disclosures included elsewhere in these notes to consolidated financial statements.

V) Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

W) Mergers and Acquisitions:

The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions. Fair value is defined as the
exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The fair value of
intangible assets, including Medicare Licenses, Certificates of Need, and certain contracts, is based on significant judgments made by our management, and accordingly, for significant items we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation
specialists.

X)

GPO Agreement/Minority Ownership Interest:

During 2013, we entered into a new
group purchasing organization agreement (“GPO”) and acquired a minority interest in the GPO for a nominal amount. In connection with the completion of an initial public offering of the stock of the GPO, during the fourth quarter of 2013,
we received cash proceeds for the sale of a portion of our ownership interest, which were recorded as deferred income and included in liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013. The deferred income will be recognized,
on a pro rata basis, as a reduction to our supplies expense over the expected life of the GPO agreement. Also in connection with this GPO agreement and related minority interest ownership, we received shares of restricted stock in the GPO which
vest ratably over a seven-year period, contingent upon our continued participation and minority ownership interest in the GPO. We will recognize the fair value of this restricted stock, as a reduction to our supplies expense, in our consolidated
statements of income on a pro rata basis over the vesting period.

Y) Accounting Standards:

Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Other Comprehensive Income:

In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued an Accounting Standards Update on reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. This guidance, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2012, requires companies to provide
information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component (the respective line items of the income statement). The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2013 had no impact on our financial position or
overall results of operations.

Presentation and Disclosure of Patient Service Revenue, Provision for Bad Debts, and the
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for Certain Health Care Entities:

During the first quarter of 2012, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2011-07, “Health Care
Entities (Topic 954): Presentation and Disclosure of Patient Service Revenue, Provision for Bad Debts, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for Certain Health Care Entities,” which required certain health care entities to change the
presentation in their statement of operations by reclassifying the provision for bad debts associated with patient service revenue from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenue (net of contractual allowances and discounts).
As a result, the provision for doubtful accounts for our acute care and behavioral health care facilities is reflected as a deduction from net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each of the years presented herein. The
adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial position or overall results of operations.



Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward
Exists:

In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance regarding the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. Under
certain circumstances, unrecognized tax benefits should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. The guidance is a change
in financial statement presentation only and has no material impact in the consolidated financial results. The guidance is effective beginning January 1, 2014 on either a prospective or retrospective basis.

2) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

Year ended December 31, 2013:

2013 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses:

During 2013, we spent an aggregate of $13 million for the purchase of real property located in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. The aggregate net purchase price of these properties was allocated to
property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet.

2013 Divestiture of Assets and Businesses:

During 2013, we received an aggregate of $37 million in connection with the divestiture of Peak Behavioral Health Services (sold during
the second quarter of 2013) and certain other assets and real property including three previously closed behavioral health care facilities. As discussed below in

Discontinued Operations

, we agreed to sell Peak Behavioral Health Services as
part of our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation (“Ascend”) in October of 2012. The aggregate pre-tax gain on these divestitures was approximately $3
million and in included in our 2013 consolidated results of operations.

Year ended December 31, 2012:

2012 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses:

During 2012, we spent $528 million to acquire the following assets and businesses:

•

spent $503 million to acquire 9 behavioral health care facilities from Ascend in October, 2012, and;

•

spent $25 million in connection with the acquisition of physician practices and various real property.

The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as
follows:

Goodwill of the facilities acquired is computed, pursuant to the residual method, by deducting the fair
value of the acquired assets and liabilities from the total purchase price. The factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill, which may also influence the purchase price, include the following for each of the acquired facilities:
(i) the historical cash flows and income levels; (ii) the reputations in their respective markets; (iii) the nature of the respective operations, and; (iv) the future cash flows and income growth projections.



Assuming the acquisition of Ascend occurred on January 1, 2011, our 2011 unaudited pro
forma net revenues would have been approximately $6.90 billion and our unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS and unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS per diluted share would have been $401 million and $4.06 per diluted
share, respectively. The 2011 unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS and unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS per diluted share include the after-tax impact of the transaction costs incurred by us in connection with the
acquisition of Ascend amounting to $5 million or $.06 per diluted share. Our 2012 unaudited pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $7.11 billion and our unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS and unaudited pro forma net
income attributable to UHS per diluted share would have been $464 million and $4.74 per diluted share, respectively.

During
the period of October 10, 2012 through December 31, 2012, the facilities acquired from Ascend generated $42 million of net revenues which are included in our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012. The
aggregate effect of the earnings generated by these facilities since the date of acquisition, less the cost on the borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition, and less the above-mentioned transaction costs, was not material to our 2012 net
income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share.

2012 Divestiture of Assets and
Businesses:

During 2012, we received $149 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:

•

received $93 million for the sale of Auburn Regional Medical Center (“Auburn”), a 159-bed acute care hospital located in Auburn, Washington
(sold in October of 2012);

•

received $50 million for the sale of the Hospital San Juan Capestrano, a 108-bed acute care hospital located in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico (sold in
January of 2012 pursuant to our below-mentioned agreement with the FTC in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010), and;

•

received an aggregate of $6 million for the sale of the real property of two non-operating behavioral health facilities and our majority ownership
interest in an outpatient surgery center located in Puerto Rico.

Included in our 2012 consolidated results
of operations was a $26 million pre-tax gain on the divestiture of Auburn. The divestiture of San Juan Capestrano (in January, 2012) did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations.

Year ended December 31, 2011:

2011 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses:

During 2011, we spent $29
million on the acquisition of businesses and real property, including the following:

•

the acquisition of administrative office buildings located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee and a multi-tenant office building located in Washington D.C.;

•

a deposit in made connection with execution of a purchase agreement for an acute care hospital in Texas which has since been terminated and the deposit
returned to us in 2012, and;

•

the acquisition of a cardiology practice in Texas.

The aggregate net cash expenditure related to the properties and/or businesses was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows:



2011 Divestitures of Assets and Businesses:

During 2011, we received $68 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:

•

the sale of three behavioral healthcare facilities (one located in Delaware and two located in Nevada) pursuant to the below-mentioned agreement with
the FTC in connection with our acquisition of PSI;

•

sale of our majority ownership interest in a radiation oncology center located in Nevada, and;

•

the real property of a closed acute care hospital.

The aggregate pre-tax net gain on these divestitures did not have a material impact on our 2011 consolidated results of operations.

Discontinued Operations:

In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the FTC in connection with our acquisition of Ascend in October of 2012, we agreed to certain conditions, including the divestiture of Peak
Behavioral Health Services (“Peak”), a 104-bed behavioral health care facility located in Santa Teresa, New Mexico. The divestiture of Peak was completed during the second quarter of 2013 for total cash proceeds of approximately $24
million resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 million which is included in our 2013 consolidated financial statements.

In October of 2012, we completed the divestiture of Auburn, a 159-bed acute care hospital located in Auburn, Washington, for total cash proceeds of approximately $93 million. This divestiture
resulted in a pre-tax gain of $26 million which was included in our 2012 consolidated financial statements.

In connection
with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the FTC in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, we agreed to divest three former PSI facilities as well as one of our legacy behavioral health facilities in Puerto Rico. Pursuant to
the terms of our agreement with the FTC, we divested:

•

in July, 2011, the MeadowWood Behavioral Health System, a 58-bed facility located in New Castle, Delaware;

•

in December, 2011, the Montevista Hospital (101-bed) and Red Rock Hospital (21-bed), both of which are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, and;

•

in January, 2012, the Hospital San Juan Capestrano, a 108-bed facility located in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico.

The operating results for Auburn, Peak and the three former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada are reflected as discontinued
operations during our period of ownership during each of the years presented herein. Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is not material to our consolidated financial statements, it
is included as a reduction to other operating expenses. Assets and liabilities for Peak were reflected as “held for sale” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012.

The following table shows the results of operations for Auburn and Peak and the former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada, on
a combined basis, which were reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership for each of the years presented herein (amounts in thousands):



3) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair Value Hedges:

During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we had no fair value hedges outstanding.

Cash
Flow Hedges:

We manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management
believes is appropriate. To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon
notional amounts. We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet. For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management
objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to
mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance
sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) within shareholders’ equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or
periods the hedged transaction affects earnings. We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions. Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability. For
derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.

For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge’s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a
formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly
effective in the future.

The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be
settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties. We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis. We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2013 and 2012 and determined the
hedges to be highly effective. We also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows. The counterparties
to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance. However, at December 31, 2013, each swap agreement entered into by us was in a net liability position which would require us to make the net
settlement payments to the counterparties. We do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

During 2011, we entered into a forward starting interest rate cap on a total notional amount of $450 million from December, 2011 to
December, 2012 reducing to $400 million from December, 2012 to December, 2013 whereby we paid a premium of $740,000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 7.00% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate
rises above 7.00% during the term of the cap. The three-month LIBOR never reached 7.00% during the term of the cap, which expired in December, 2013, and therefore no payment was made to us.

We also entered into six forward starting interest rate swaps in 2011 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $425
million and receive three-month LIBOR. Three of these swaps with a total notional amount of $225 million became effective in March, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015. The average fixed rate



payable on these swaps is 1.91%. The three remaining interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of $75 million, $25 million and $100 million became effective in December, 2011 and have
corresponding fixed rates of 1.32%, 1.96% and 2.50%. The $75 million and $25 million interest rate swaps matured in December, 2012 and December, 2013, respectively, and the $100 million interest rate swap is scheduled to mature in December, 2014.

During 2010, we entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount
of $600 million and receive three-month LIBOR. Each of the four swaps became effective in December, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015. The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 2.38%.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, we entered into two interest rate swaps whereby we paid a fixed rate on a total notional principal
amount of $150 million and received three-month LIBOR. Each of the two interest rate swaps, which are now expired, had an initial notional principal amount of $75 million. The fixed rate payable on one of the interest rate swaps was 4.87% and it
matured in October, 2011. The fixed rate payable on the other interest rate swap, on which the notional principal amount reduced to $50 million in October, 2010, was 4.76% and it matured in October, 2012.

We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on
quotes from banks. We consider those inputs to be “level 2” in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities. The fair value of our
interest rate swaps was a liability of $24 million at December 31, 2013, of which $19 million is included in other current liabilities and $5 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet. At
December 31, 2012, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $41 million, substantially all of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.

4) LONG-TERM DEBT

A summary of long-term debt follows:



In May, 2013, we entered into a third amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the
credit agreement, dated as of November 15, 2010 (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”), which became effective that day, among UHS, the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time parties thereto,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and the other agents party thereto. The Third Amendment provides for a reduction in the interest rates payable in connection with certain borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Upon the
effectiveness of the Third Amendment, UHS replaced its existing $745.9 million senior secured Tranche B term loan with a new senior secured Tranche B-1 term loan in the same amount on substantially the same terms as the Tranche B term loan, other
than lower interest rates. Borrowings under the Tranche B-1 term loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, one, two, three or six month LIBOR, plus an applicable margin of 2.25% or ABR plus an applicable margin of 1.25%. The
minimum LIBOR and ABR rates for the Tranche B term loan of 1.0% and 2.0%, respectively, were eliminated.

In September, 2012,
we entered into a second amendment (“Second Amendment”) to our Credit Agreement which provided for: (i) a new $900 million Term Loan-A (“Term Loan A2”) at the same interest rates as our existing Term Loan A and a final
maturity date of August 15, 2016; (ii) the extension of the maturity date on a substantial portion of our $800 million revolving credit facility commitment with $777 million of the commitment extended to mature on August 15, 2016 and
the remaining $23 million commitment scheduled to mature on November 15, 2015 (there were no borrowings outstanding pursuant to our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2013), and; (iii) the extension of the maturity date on a
substantial portion of our Term Loan-A borrowings which, based upon the outstanding Term Loan-A borrowings as of December 31, 2013, $892 million is scheduled to mature on August 15, 2016 and the remaining $43 million is scheduled to mature
on November 15, 2015. The Second Amendment also provides for increased flexibility for refinancing and certain other modifications but substantially all other terms of the Credit Agreement remain unchanged.

In September, 2012, we used $700 million of the proceeds from the new Term Loan A2 facility to extinguish a portion of our higher priced,
Term Loan-B facility. Pricing under the new Term Loan A2 facility was 1% lower than the Term Loan-B facility and did not include a LIBOR Floor whereas, at that time, the Term Loan-B facility had a 1% LIBOR Floor (which has since been eliminated as
part of the above-mentioned Third Amendment in May, 2013). During the third quarter of 2012, in connection with the extinguishment of a portion of our Term Loan-B facility, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $29 million to write-off the related portion
of the Term Loan-B deferred financing costs.

The Credit Agreement, as amended, is a senior secured facility which, as of
December 31, 2013, provided for an aggregate commitment amount of $3.16 billion, comprised of an $800 million revolving credit facility, a $939 million Term Loan-A facility, a $550 million Term Loan-B facility and a $872 million Term Loan-A2
facility. The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and our material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material
subsidiaries.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either (1) the ABR rate which is defined as the
rate per annum equal to, at our election: the greatest of (a) the lender’s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month LIBOR rate plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable
margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit, Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 borrowings and 1.25% for Term Loan B borrowings or (2) the one, two, three or six month
LIBOR rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% for revolving credit, Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 borrowings and 2.25% for Term Loan-B
borrowings. The current applicable margins are 0.50% for ABR-based loans, 1.50% for LIBOR-based loans under the revolving credit, Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 facilities and 2.25% under the Term Loan-B facility.

As of December 31, 2013, we had no borrowings outstanding pursuant to the terms of our $800 million revolving credit facility and we
had $755 million of available borrowing capacity, net of $25 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to a short-term, on-demand credit facility and $20 million of outstanding letters of credit.



During 2013, we made scheduled principal payments of $72 million on the Term Loan-A and Term
Loan A2 facilities. Quarterly installment payments (“Installment Payments”) are due on the Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 facilities which approximate $72 million in 2014, $77 million in 2015 and $46 million in 2016. The Installment Payments
due on the Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 facilities during 2014 are classified as current maturities of long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2013. Although no Installment Payments are due on the Term Loan-B
facility, we made optional repayments of $196 million during the fourth quarter of 2013.

In October, 2013 our $275 million
accounts receivable securitization program (“Securitization”) with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks was amended to extend the maturity date to October 25, 2016 and reduce the interest rate spread and commitment fee.
Substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals (“Receivables”) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings. We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings. We maintain effective
control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us. The Receivables, however, are owned by the special
purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities. The wholly-owned special purpose entities
use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks. The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned
special purpose entities that securitize the loans. At December 31, 2013, we had $240 million of outstanding borrowings and $35 million of additional capacity pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program.

Our $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes (the “Unsecured Notes”) are scheduled to mature on October 1, 2018. The
Unsecured Notes were issued on September 29, 2010 and registered in April, 2011. Interest on the Unsecured Note is payable semiannually in arrears on April 1st and October 1st of each year. The Unsecured Notes can be redeemed in whole
at anytime subject to a make-whole call at treasury rate plus 50 basis points prior to October 1, 2014. They are also redeemable in whole or in part at a price of: (i) 103.5% on or after October 1, 2014; (ii) 101.75% on or after
October 1, 2015, and; (iii) 100% on or after October 1, 2016. These Unsecured Notes are guaranteed by a group of subsidiaries (each of which is a 100% directly or indirectly owned subsidiary of Universal Health Services, Inc.) which
fully and unconditionally guarantee the Unsecured Notes on a joint and several basis, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions.

On June 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior notes which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016 (the “7.125% Notes”). Interest on the 7.125% Notes is payable
semiannually in arrears on June 30th and December 30th of each year. In June, 2008, we issued an additional $150 million of 7.125% Notes which formed a single series with the original 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2006. Other than their
date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to and trade interchangeably with, the 7.125% Notes which were originally issued in June, 2006.

In connection with the entering into of the Credit Agreement on November 15, 2010, and in accordance with the Indenture dated
January 20, 2000 governing the rights of our existing notes, we entered into a supplemental indenture pursuant to which our 7.125% Notes (due in 2016) were equally and ratably secured with the lenders under the Credit Agreement with respect to
the collateral for so long as the lenders under the Credit Agreement are so secured.

The average amounts outstanding during
each of years 2013, 2012 and 2011 under the current and prior Credit Agreements, demand notes and accounts receivable securitization programs was $2.9 billion, with corresponding interest rates of 2.2%, 2.9% and 3.4% including commitment and
facility fees. The maximum amounts outstanding at any month-end were $3.00 billion in 2013, $3.06 billion in 2012 and $3.03 billion in 2011. The effective interest rate on our current and prior Credit Agreements, accounts receivable securitization
programs, and demand notes, which includes the respective interest expense, commitment and facility fees,



designated interest rate swaps expense and amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts, was 3.6% in 2013, 4.5% in 2012 and 4.6% in 2011.

Our Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw. The Credit Agreement contains
covenants that include a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens and indebtedness, transactions with affiliates and dividends; and requires compliance with financial covenants including maximum leverage and minimum
interest coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all required covenants as of December 31, 2013.

The carrying values
of our debt at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $3.3 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. The fair values of our debt at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of our debt was computed
based upon quotes received from financial institutions. We consider these to be “level 2” in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with debt instruments.

Aggregate maturities follow:

5) COMMON STOCK

Dividends

Cash dividends of $.20 per share ($19.6 million in the aggregate) were declared and paid during 2013, $.60 per share ($58.4 million in the aggregate), including a $.40 per share special cash dividend
($38.9 million) were declared and paid during 2012 and $.20 per share ($19.5 million in the aggregate) were declared and paid during 2011. All classes of our common stock have similar economic rights.

Stock Repurchase Programs

In various prior years, our Board of Directors has approved stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our outstanding Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market
prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. There is no expiration date for our stock repurchase programs. The most recent approval occurred during 2007 at which time our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 10 million
shares, a portion of which (as reflected below) remains available for purchase as of December 31, 2013.

The following
schedule provides information related to our stock repurchase programs for each of the three years ended December 31, 2013. All of the shares repurchased during 2013 and 2012 related to income tax



withholding obligations resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock grants. No shares were repurchased during 2013 or 2012 pursuant to our publicly announced
stock repurchase program.

(a.)

During 2013, there were 427,170 shares repurchased at an average price of $63.68 per share related to income tax withholding obligations in connection with stock-based
compensation programs. During 2012, there were 432,562 shares repurchased at an average price of $44.28 per share related to income tax withholding obligations in connection with stock-based compensation programs, and 750 shares repurchased at an
average of $.01 per share related to restricted shares that were forfeited by former employees pursuant to the terms of our restricted stock purchase plan. During 2011, there were 217,649 shares repurchased at an average price of $45.51 per share
related to income tax withholding obligations in connection with stock-based compensation programs.

Stock-based Compensation Plans

At December 31, 2013, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans. Pursuant to the FASB’s guidance, we expense the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based
compensation pursuant to the straight-line method over the stated vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The expense associated with share-based compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net
income to cash provided by operating activities and aggregated to $27.8 million in 2013, $22.5 million in 2012 and $18.2 million in 2011. In accordance with ASC 718, excess income tax benefits related to stock based compensation are classified as
cash inflows from financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Previously for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we included $16.0 million and $7.6 million, respectively, of excess income tax benefits related to
stock based compensation as net cash provided by operating activities as included in the change in accrued and deferred income taxes for each year. In our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, as included herein, those amounts are reflected as cash
inflows from financing activities for each respective year. We assessed this misclassification and concluded that it was not material to our previously issued annual and quarterly Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. During 2013, we generated
$20.1 million of excess income tax benefits related to stock based compensation which are reflected as cash inflows from financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Compensation costs related to outstanding stock options were recognized as follows: (i) a pre-tax charge of $25.8 million ($16.1
million after-tax) during 2013; (ii) a pre-tax charge of $20.1 million ($12.5 million after-tax)



during 2012, and; (iii) a pre-tax charge of $15.8 million ($9.8 million after-tax) during 2011. In addition, during the years ended 2013, 2012 and 2011, compensation costs of $1.4
million ($853,000 after-tax), $2.3 million ($1.4 million after-tax) and $2.0 million ($1.2 million after-tax), respectively, were recognized related to restricted stock.

We adopted the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended in 2008 and 2010, (the “Stock Incentive Plan”) which replaced our Amended and Restated 1992 Stock Option Plan which expired in July of 2005.
An aggregate of twenty-three million shares of Class B Common Stock has been reserved under the Stock Incentive Plan. There were 2,737,725; 2,621,161 and 2,473,500 stock options, net of cancellations, granted during 2013, 2012 and 2011,
respectively. The per option weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2013, 2012 and 2011, was $13.33, $10.73 and $11.62, respectively. Stock options to purchase Class B Common Stock have been granted to our officers, key
employees and directors under our above referenced stock option plans. All stock options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of the grant. Options are exercisable ratably over a four-year period beginning
one year after the date of the grant. All outstanding options expire five years after the date of the grant.

The fair value
of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were derived from averaging the number of options granted during the most recent five-year period. The
weighted-average assumptions reflected below were each based upon eighteen option grants.

The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon four year yield in effect at the time of
grant. The expected life of the stock options granted was estimated using the historical behavior of employees. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility for a period equal to the stock option’s expected life. Expected dividend
yield is based on our dividend yield at the time of grant.

The table below summarizes our stock option activity during each
of the last three years:



The following table provides information about unvested options for the year
December 31, 2013:

The following table provides information about all outstanding options, and exercisable options, at
December 31, 2013:

The total in-the-money value of all stock options exercised during the years ended December 31,
2013, 2012 and 2011 were $70.9 million, $54.4 million and $28.9 million, respectively.

The weighted average
remaining contractual life for options outstanding and weighted average exercise price per share for exercisable options at December 31, 2013 were as follows:

(a)

Assumes a weighted average forfeiture rate of 10.8%.

In addition to the Stock Incentive Plan, we have the following stock incentive and purchase plans: (i) the 2010 Employees’ Restricted Stock Purchase Plan (“2010 Plan”), which replaced
the Second Amended and Restated 2001 Employees’ Restricted Stock Purchase Plan (“2001 Plan”), which allows eligible participants to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock at par value, subject to certain restrictions, and;
(ii) a 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows eligible employees to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock at a ten percent discount. There were 90,587, 117,901 and 98,366 shares issued pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Compensation expense recorded in connection with this plan was $581,000, $533,000 and $461,000 during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.



We have reserved 6.0 million shares of Class B Common Stock for issuance under these
various plans (excluding terminated plans) and have issued approximately 1.0 million shares, net of cancellations, pursuant to the terms of these plans (excluding terminated plans) as of December 31, 2013.

During 2013, pursuant to the 2010 Plan, the Compensation Committee (“Committee”) approved the issuance of 10,000 restricted
shares of our Class B Common Stock at a weighted average price of $80.36 per share ($803,600 in the aggregate) to various employees. These shares are scheduled to vest ratably on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date.
We recorded compensation expense of approximately $41,000 during 2013 in connection with this grant. The remaining expense associated with these awards (estimated at approximately $760,000 as of December 31, 2013) will be recorded over the
remaining vesting periods of the awards, assuming the recipients remain employed by us.

During 2012, pursuant to the 2010
Plan, the Committee approved the issuance of 54,127 restricted shares of our Class B Common Stock at a weighted average price of $36.95 per share ($2.0 million in the aggregate) to our CEO and Chairman of the Board. These shares are scheduled to
vest as follows: 50% on the first anniversary date of the grant, and 25% on each of the second and third anniversary dates of the grant, assuming our CEO remains employed by us. In the event that our CEO’s employment is terminated for reasons
other than death, disability or retirement, any unvested shares will be forfeited, unless otherwise specified in a separation agreement between us and our CEO. 27,063 of these shares became fully vested during 2013. In connection with this grant, we
recorded compensation expense of approximately $523,000 during 2013 and approximately $1 million during 2012. The remaining expense associated with these awards (estimated at approximately $500,000 as of December 31, 2013) will be recorded over
the remaining vesting periods of the awards, assuming the recipient remain employed by us.

During 2011, pursuant to the 2010
Plan, the Committee approved the issuance of 21,500 restricted shares of our Class B Common Stock at a weighted average price of $53.21 per share ($1.1 million in the aggregate) to various employees, of which 10,000 of these shares became fully
vested during 2013. During 2012, 750 of these shares became fully vested and 750 of these shares were cancelled. The remaining 10,000 shares are scheduled to vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. We recorded compensation expense of
$354,000 during 2013, $370,000 during 2012 and $198,000 during 2011 in connection with these grants. The remaining expense associated with these awards (estimated at $183,000 as of December 31, 2013) will be recorded over the remaining vesting
period of the awards, assuming the recipients remain employed by us.

The 2001 Plan, as described above, expired in March,
2010. Under this plan, we had 2.4 million shares of Class B Common Stock reserved for issuance and have issued approximately 1.2 million shares, net of cancellations, pursuant to the terms of this plan as of December 31, 2010, of
which 39,831 became fully vesting during 2013, 62,044 became fully vested during 2012 and 78,133 became fully vested during 2011.

During the first quarter of 2010, pursuant to the 2001 Plan and prior to its expiration, the Committee approved the issuance of 49,472 restricted shares of our Class B Common Stock at $30.32 per share
($1.5 million in the aggregate) to our CEO and Chairman of the Board. These shares, which were issued pursuant to a provision in our CEO’s employment agreement, are scheduled to vest ratably on the first, second, third and fourth anniversary
dates of the grant, assuming our CEO remains employed by us. In the event that our CEO’s employment is terminated by reason of disability, death, without proper cause or due to breach of the CEO’s employment agreement by us, the vesting of
these awards will occur immediately. 12,368 of these shares became fully vested in each of 2013, 2012 and 2011. In connection with this grant, we recorded compensation expense of $375,000 in each of 2013, 2012 and 2011 and $355,000 during 2010, and
the remaining expense associated with this award (estimated at $20,000 as of December 31, 2013) will be recorded over the remaining vesting period of the award.

During the first quarter of 2009, pursuant to the 2001 Plan, the Committee approved the issuance of 109,850 restricted shares of our Class B Common Stock at $20.26 per share ($2.2 million in the
aggregate) to our CEO.



These shares are scheduled to vest ratably on the first, second, third and fourth anniversary dates of the grant and are subject to the same conditions and terms as mentioned above in connection
with the grant of restricted shares during the first quarter of 2010. 27,463 of these shares became fully vested in 2013, 27,462 of these shares became fully vested in each of 2012 and 2011 and 27,463 of these shares became fully vested in 2010. In
connection with this grant, we recorded compensation expense of approximately $74,000 during 2013, $556,000 during each of 2012, 2011 and 2010 and $482,000 during 2009. This award was fully vested at December 31, 2013.

During the first quarter of 2008, pursuant to the 2001 Plan, the Committee approved the issuance of 62,190 restricted shares of our Class
B Common Stock at $24.12 per share ($1.5 million in the aggregate) to our CEO. These shares were scheduled to vest ratably on the first, second, third and fourth anniversary dates of the grant and were subject to the same conditions and terms as
mentioned above in connection with the grant of restricted shares during the first quarter of 2010. 15,548 and 15,546 of these shares became fully vesting during 2012 and 2011, respectively, and 15,548 of these shares became fully vested in each of
2010 and 2009. In connection with this grant, we recorded compensation expense of $15,000 during 2012 and $375,000 during 2011. This award was fully vested at December 31, 2012.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, pursuant to the 2001 Plan, the Committee approved the issuance of 61,362 restricted shares of our
Class B Common Stock at $24.45 per share ($1.5 million in the aggregate) to our CEO. These shares were scheduled to vest ratably on the first, second, third and fourth anniversary dates of the grant and were subject to the same conditions and terms
as mentioned above in connection with the grant of restricted shares during the first quarter of 2010. 15,341 of these shares became fully vested in each of 2011 and 2010 and 15,340 of these shares became fully vested in each of 2009 and 2008. In
connection with this grant, we recorded compensation expense of $333,000 during 2011 and $375,000 during 2010. This award was fully vested at December 31, 2011.

Additionally, during 2007, pursuant to the 2001 Plan, the Committee approved the issuance of 22,250 restricted shares of our Class B Common stock at a weighted average of $29.62 per share ($659,000 in the
aggregate) to various employees. These shares had various vesting schedules. We recorded compensation expense of $42,000 during 2012 and $120,000 during 2011, in connection with these grants. These awards were fully vested at December 31, 2012.

At December 31, 2013, 25,657,523 shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of
Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans. Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share
basis into Class B Common Stock.

In connection with the long-term incentive plans described above, we recorded compensation
expense of $2.0 million in 2013, $2.8 million in 2012 and $2.4 million in 2011. Including the compensation expense recognized related to outstanding stock options of $25.8 million in 2013, $20.1 million in 2012 and $15.8 million in 2011, we recorded
a total stock compensation expense of $27.8 million in 2013, $22.5 million in 2012 and $18.2 million in 2011.



6) INCOME TAXES

Components of income tax expense/(benefit) are as follows (amounts in thousands):

Deferred taxes are required to be classified based on the financial statement classification of the
related assets and liabilities which give rise to temporary differences. Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The components of deferred taxes
are as follows (amounts in thousands):

There was no material impact of deferred taxes recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of Ascend
Health Corporation.



The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income
before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands):




Provision for income taxes

Impacting the effective tax rates during 2013, 2012 and 2011 were favorable discrete tax items of
approximately $1 million recorded during each year to adjust the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions.

A
reconciliation between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate is as follows:

Included in “Other current assets” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet are prepaid federal,
foreign, and state income taxes amounting to approximately $5 million and $7 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The net deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised as follows (amounts in thousands):

The assets and liabilities classified as current relate primarily to the allowance for uncollectible
patient accounts, compensation-related accruals and the current portion of the temporary differences related to self- insurance reserves. At December 31, 2013, state net operating loss carryforwards (expiring in years 2014 through 2033), and
credit carryforwards available to offset future taxable income approximated $959 million, representing approximately $47 million in deferred state tax benefit (net of the federal benefit). At December 31, 2013, there were foreign net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $8 million expiring through 2021 representing approximately $3 million in deferred foreign tax benefit.



A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that some portion of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. Based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that certain of our state tax benefits will not be realized. Therefore, valuation allowances of approximately $44 million and $41 million
have been reflected as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. During 2013, the valuation allowance on these state tax benefits increased by approximately $3 million due to additional net operating losses incurred. In addition, valuation
allowances of approximately $3 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 related to foreign net operating losses. There were no significant increases in valuation allowances as a result of the acquisition of Ascend
Health Corporation.

We adopted the provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes effective January 1, 2007.
During 2013 and 2012, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were increased less than $1 million due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years. During 2013, the estimated
liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were reduced due to the lapse of the statute of limitations resulting in a net income tax benefit of approximately $1 million. The balance at each of
December 31, 2013 and 2012, if subsequently recognized, that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes is approximately $2 million and $4 million, respectively.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision. As of December 31,
2013 and 2012, we have accrued interest and penalties of less than $1 million as of each date. The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the 2010 and subsequent years. Foreign and U.S. state and local jurisdictions have statutes of
limitations generally ranging for 3 to 4 years. The statute of limitations on certain jurisdictions could expire within the next twelve months. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next 12
months, however, it is anticipated that any such change, if it were to occur, would not have a material impact on our results of operations.

The tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 is as follows (amounts in thousands).

7) LEASE COMMITMENTS

Four of our hospital facilities are held under operating leases with Universal Health Realty Income Trust with terms
expiring in 2014 and 2016 (see Note 9 for additional disclosure). We also lease the real property of certain facilities acquired by us in connection with the acquisition of PSI in November, 2010 and the acquisition of Ascend in October, 2012 (see
Item 2.

Properties

for additional disclosure).

A summary of property under capital lease follows (amounts in
thousands):



Future minimum rental payments under lease commitments with a term of more than one year as
of December 31, 2013, are as follows (amounts in thousands):

We incurred no additional capital lease obligations during 2013, 2012 or 2011. In the ordinary course of
business, our facilities routinely lease equipment pursuant to new lease arrangements that will likely result in future lease and rental expense in excess of amounts indicated above.

8) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Professional and General Liability, Workers’ Compensation Liability and Property Insurance

Professional and General Liability and Workers Compensation Liability:

Effective January 1, 2008, most of our subsidiaries became self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10
million per occurrence. Prior to our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (“PSI”) in November, 2010, our subsidiaries purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of $10
million up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. However, we are liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.

Prior to our acquisition in November, 2010, the PSI subsidiaries were commercially insured for professional and general
liability insurance claims in excess of a $3 million self-insured retention to a limit of $75 million. PSI utilized its captive insurance company and that captive insurance company remains in place after our acquisition of PSI to manage
the self-insured retention for all former PSI subsidiaries for claims incurred prior to January 1, 2011. The captive insurance company also continues to insure all professional and general liability claims, regardless of date incurred, for the
former PSI subsidiaries located in Florida and Puerto Rico.

Since our acquisition of PSI on November 15, 2010, the
former PSI subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $3 million per occurrence and our legacy subsidiaries (which are not former PSI subsidiaries) are self-insured for professional and general liability
exposure up to $10 million per occurrence. Effective November, 2010, our subsidiaries (including the former PSI subsidiaries) were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of
the applicable per occurrence self-insured retention (either $3 million or $10 million) up to $250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of
$10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. The 9 behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012 have general and professional liability policies through commercial insurance
carriers which provide for up to $20 million of



aggregate coverage, subject to a $25,000 per occurrence deductible. These facilities, like our other facilities, are also provided excess coverage through commercial insurance carriers for
coverage in excess of the underlying commercial policy limitations up to $250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.

Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other
things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of
amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent
uncertainties involved in making this estimate. Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us
will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual
for our professional and general liability claims was $206 million, of which $44 million is included in current liabilities. As of December 31, 2012, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $279 million, of which
$48 million is included in current liabilities.

We recorded reductions to our professional and general liability
self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $81 million during 2013, $27 million during 2012 and $11 million during 2011. The favorable change in our estimated future claims payments recorded during 2013, relating to years prior
to 2013, were due primarily to: (i) an increased weighting given to company-specific metrics (to 100% from 75%), and decreased general industry metrics (to 0% from 25%), related to projected incidents per exposure, historical claims experience
and loss development factors; (ii) historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate, and; (iii) a decrease in claims related to certain higher
risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years. As the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased, thereby providing for a
statistically significant data group, and taking into consideration our long-history of company-specific risk management programs and claims experience, our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general
liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends. The favorable change recorded during 2012 resulted from favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments pursuant to a reserve analysis. The
favorable change recorded during 2011 consisted primarily of third-party recoveries and reserve reductions in connection with PHICO–related claims which we became liable for upon PHICO’s (a former commercial insurance carrier) liquidation
in 2002.

As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our workers’ compensation liability claims was $64 million,
of which $34 million is included in current liabilities. As of December 31, 2012, the total accrual for our workers’ compensation liability claims was $66 million, of which $35 million is included in current liabilities. The adjustments
recorded during the last three years to our prior year reserves for workers’ compensation claims did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 or 2011.

Property Insurance:

We have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence, subject to a $250,000 deductible for the majority
of our properties (the properties acquired from Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. are subject to a $50,000 deductible). Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the
property. In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting



from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses). Our earthquake limit is $250 million, subject to a deductible of $250,000, except
for facilities located within documented fault zones. Earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the United States are subject to a $100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the
declared total insurable value of the property. The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million, subject to a $25,000 deductible. Non-critical flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility.
Since certain of our facilities have been designated by our insurer as flood prone, we have elected to purchase policies from The National Flood Insurance Program to cover a substantial portion of the applicable deductible.

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to litigation, as outlined below.

Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) and Other Government Investigations

In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of
Justice (“DOJ”) advising of a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (“ICDs”) from 2003 to 2010 at several of our acute care facilities. The
DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a National Coverage Determination regarding these devices. We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In July, 2012, one of our subsidiaries, Peachford Behavioral Health System of Atlanta
located in Atlanta, Georgia, received a subpoena from the OIG for the Department of Health and Human Services requesting various documents. We have provided all requested documents. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we were notified that the
governmental agencies investigating this matter had declined to proceed.

In February, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena
requesting various documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. (“UHS”) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and several UHS owned facilities including: Keys of Carolina, Old
Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a, The Pines
Residential Treatment Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health. Prior to receiving this subpoena: (i) the Keys of Carolina and Old Vineyard received
notification during the second half of 2012 from the United States Department of Justice of its intent to proceed with an investigation following requests for documents for the period of January, 2007 to October, 2012 from the North Carolina state
Attorney General’s Office; (ii) Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center received a subpoena in December, 2012 from the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Virginia requesting various documents from July, 2006 to the date of the subpoena,
and; (iii) The Meadows Psychiatric Center received a subpoena from the OIG in February, 2013 requesting certain documents from 2008 to the date of the subpoena. Unrelated to these matters, the Keys of Carolina was closed and the real property
was sold in January, 2013. In April, 2013, the OIG served facility specific subpoenas on Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting various documents from January, 2005 to the present. In June, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena
on Coastal Harbor Health System in Savannah, Georgia requesting documents from January, 2009 to the date of the subpoena. In July, 2013, another subpoena was issued to Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting additional
records. We have been advised by the DOJ’s Criminal Frauds Section that they have received a referral from the DOJ Civil Division and have opened an investigation of River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center. In February, 2014, we
were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds Section has been expanded to include the National Deaf Academy. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigations, liability of the facilities
and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with these matters.



Matters Relating to PSI:

The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.) which were in
existence prior to the acquisition of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010:

Garden City Employees’ Retirement System v. PSI:

This is a purported
shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against PSI and the former directors in 2009 alleging violations of federal securities laws. We intend to defend the case vigorously.
Should we be deemed liable in this matter, we believe we would be entitled to commercial insurance recoveries for amounts paid by us, subject to certain limitations and deductibles. Included in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,
2013 and 2012, is an estimated reserve (current liability) and corresponding commercial insurance recovery (current asset) which did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Although we believe the commercial insurance recoveries are
adequate to satisfy potential liability and related legal fees in connection with this matter, we can provide no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed the commercial insurance recoveries which would make us liable for the excess.

Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:

In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the
facility. The requested documents have been collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination. Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July 2011 requesting additional documents, which have been collected and delivered to the
DOJ. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.

Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital:

In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010. The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ. At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility
and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.

Virginia Department of Medical Assistance
Services Recoupment Claims:

The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (“DMAS”) has conducted audits
at seven former PSI Residential Treatment Centers operated in the Commonwealth of Virginia to confirm compliance with provider rules under the state’s Medicaid Provider Services Manual (“Manual”). As a result of those audits, DMAS
claims the facilities failed to comply with the requirements of the Manual and has requested repayment of Medicaid payments to those facilities. PSI had previously filed appeals to repayment demands at each facility which are currently pending. We
had previously agreed to a settlement of this matter which was approved by Virginia state officials during the first quarter of 2014. The aggregate refund of Medicaid payments made to those facilities, as requested by DMAS, and the settlement amount
is not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

General:

The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government
healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government



action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers.
Currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies. Providers that are found to have
violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts
received from the government for previously billed patient services. We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and
industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours. Although we believe our
policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations
and other matters discussed herein. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.

The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting
penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable
nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is
in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes. It is possible that
the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.

In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect
our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In addition to our long-term debt obligations as discussed in
Note 4-

Long-Term Debt

and our operating lease obligations as discussed in Note 7-

Lease Commitments

, we have various other contractual commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2013 as follows: (i) other combined estimated
future purchase obligations of $261 million related to a long-term contract with third-parties consisting primarily of certain revenue cycle data processing services for our acute care facilities ($76 million), expected future costs to be paid to a
third-party vendor in connection with the purchase, implementation and on-going operation of an electronic health records application for each of our acute care facilities ($149 million), purchase commitment expected to be incurred in 2014 related
to certain equipment for our acute care hospitals ($33 million) and estimated minimum liabilities for physician commitments expected to be paid in the future ($3 million); (ii) estimated construction commitment of $153 million made to a third-party
for construction of a new acute care hospital located in Henderson, Nevada, and; (iii) combined estimated future payments of $223 million related to our non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan ($205 million consisting of estimated
payments through 2088) and other retirement plan liabilities ($17 million).

As of December 31, 2013 we were party to
certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which totaled $85 million consisting of: (i) $69 million related to our self-insurance programs, and; (ii) $16 million of other debt and public
utility guarantees.



9) RELATIONSHIP WITH UNIVERSAL HEALTH REALTY INCOME TRUST AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust:

At December 31, 2013, we held approximately 6.1% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the
“Trust”). We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the Trust’s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities.
In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust. Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust
using the equity method of accounting. We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $2.4 million during 2013, $2.1 million during 2012 and $2.0
million during 2011.

Our pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $842,000 during 2013, $1.2 million during 2012 and $4.6
million during 2011, and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year. Included in our share of the Trust’s income for 2012 and 2011 was approximately $500,000 in 2012 and $3.7 million in 2011
related to our share of the net favorable impact realized by the Trust in connection with: (i) gains on the sale of medical office buildings (in 2012 and 2011), and; (ii) gain on fair value recognition resulting from the Trust’s
purchase of minority ownership interests in majority owned limited liability companies partially offset by a provision for asset impairment (in 2011).

The carrying value of our investment in the Trust was $8.1 million and $9.3 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. The market value of our investment in the Trust was $31.5 million at December 31, 2013 and $39.9 million at December 31, 2012, based on the closing price of the Trust’s stock on the respective dates.

Total rent expense under the operating leases on the four hospital facilities with the Trust (as discussed below) was $16.4 million
during 2013 and $16.3 million during each of 2012 and 2011. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds either 100% of the ownership interest
or various noncontrolling, majority ownership interests.

The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain
properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries. Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional
5-year renewal terms. Each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below. The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter
revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year. The leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.

Pursuant to the terms of the leases with the Trust, we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of
the then current term. In addition, we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or;
(ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer. We also have the right to purchase the respective leased facilities
at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at their appraised fair market value as well as purchase any or all of the four leased hospital properties at their appraised fair market value upon one month’s notice should a change of
control of the Trust occur.



The table below details the remaining renewal options and terms for each of our four
hospital facilities leased from the Trust:

(a)

We have three 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2031).

(b)

We have one 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2021) and two 5-year renewal options at fair market value lease rates (2022 through 2031).

(c)

We have two 5-year renewal options at fair market value lease rates (2015 through 2024).

Other Related Party Transactions:

In December, 2010, our Board of Directors approved the Company’s entering into supplemental life insurance plans and agreements on the lives of our chief executive officer (“CEO”) and his
wife. As a result of these agreements, based on actuarial tables and other assumptions, during the life expectancies of the insureds, we would pay approximately $25 million in premiums, and certain trusts owned by our chief executive officer, would
pay approximately $8 million in premiums. Based on the projected premiums mentioned above, and assuming the policies remain in effect until the death of the insureds, we will be entitled to receive death benefit proceeds of no less than $33 million
representing the $25 million of aggregate premiums paid by us as well as the $8 million of aggregate premiums paid by the trusts. During 2013 we paid approximately $1.3 million in premium payments and during each of 2012 and 2011, we paid
approximately $1.4 million in premium payments. These agreements did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations during 2013, 2012 or 2011.

A member of our Board of Directors and member of the Executive Committee is Of Counsel to the law firm used by us as our principal
outside counsel. This Board member is also the trustee of certain trusts for the benefit of our CEO and his family. This law firm also provides personal legal services to our CEO.

10) PENSION PLAN

We maintain contributory and non-contributory retirement plans for eligible employees. Our contributions to the
contributory plan amounted to $29.9 million, $27.3 million and $21.7 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The non-contributory plan is a defined benefit pension plan which covers employees of one of our subsidiaries. The benefits are based
on years of service and the employee’s highest compensation for any five years of employment. Our funding policy is to contribute annually at least the minimum amount that should be funded in accordance with the provisions of ERISA.



The following table shows the reconciliation of the defined benefit pension plan as of
December 31, 2013 and 2012:

The accumulated benefit obligation was $102.3 million and $112.7 million as of
December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation by $4.1 million. As of December 31, 2012, the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the
fair value of plan assets by $8.6 million.

We estimate that there will be a $1.1 million net loss amortized from accumulated
other comprehensive income during 2014.

The market values of our pension plan assets at December 31, 2013 and
December 31, 2012 by asset category are as follows:

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we considered the historical
returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio.



The following table shows expected benefit payments for the years ended December 31,
2013 through 2023 for our defined pension plan. There will be benefit payments under this plan beyond 2023.

Investment Policy, Guidelines and Objectives have been established for the defined benefit pension plan.
The investment policy is in keeping with the fiduciary requirements under existing federal laws and managed in accordance with the Prudent Investor Rule. Total portfolio risk is regularly evaluated and compared to that of the plan’s policy
target allocation and judged on a relative basis over a market cycle. The following asset allocation policy and ranges have been established in accordance with the overall risk and return objectives of the portfolio:

In accordance with the investment policy, the portfolio will invest in high quality, large and small
capitalization companies traded on national exchanges, and investment grade securities. The investment managers will not write or buy options for speculative purposes; securities may not be margined or sold short. The manager may employ futures or
options for the purpose of hedging exposure, and will not purchase unregistered sectors, private placements, partnerships or commodities.

11) SEGMENT REPORTING

Our reportable operating segments consist of acute care hospital services and behavioral health care services. The
“Other” segment column below includes centralized services including information services, purchasing, reimbursement, accounting, taxation, legal, advertising, design and construction and patient accounting as well as the operating results
for our other operating entities including outpatient surgery and radiation centers. The chief operating decision making group for our acute care hospital services and behavioral health care services is comprised of our Chief Executive Officer, the
President and the Presidents of each operating segment. The Presidents for each operating segment also manage the profitability of each respective segment’s various facilities. The operating segments are managed separately because each
operating segment represents a business unit that offers different types of healthcare services or operates in different healthcare environments. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,



2013. The corporate overhead allocations, as reflected below, are utilized for internal reporting purposes and are comprised of each period’s projected corporate-level operating expenses
(excluding interest expense). The overhead expenses are captured and allocated directly to each segment, to the extent possible, with the non-directly allocated overhead expenses allocated based upon each segment’s respective percentage of
total facility-based operating expenses.
