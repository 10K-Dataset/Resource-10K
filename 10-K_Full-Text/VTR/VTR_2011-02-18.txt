Forward-Looking
    Statements

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

includes “forward-looking statements” within the
    meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
    amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E
    of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”). All statements regarding our or our
    tenants’, operators’, managers’ or
    borrowers’ expected future financial position, results of

    forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and
    security holders must recognize that actual results may differ
    from our expectations. We do not undertake a duty to update
    these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the
    date on which they are made.

Our actual future results and trends may differ materially from
    expectations depending on a variety of factors discussed in our
    filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
    “SEC”). These factors include without limitation:

•

The ability and willingness of our tenants, operators,
    borrowers, managers and other third parties to meet

and/or

perform their obligations under their respective contractual
    arrangements with us, including, in some cases, their
    obligations to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and
    against various claims, litigation and liabilities;

•

The ability of our tenants, operators, borrowers and managers to
    maintain the financial strength and liquidity necessary to
    satisfy their respective obligations and liabilities to third
    parties, including without limitation obligations under their
    existing credit facilities and other indebtedness;

Our success in implementing our business strategy and our
    ability to identify, underwrite, finance, consummate and
    integrate diversifying acquisitions or investments, including
    our pending transaction with Atria Senior Living Group, Inc. and
    those in different asset types and outside the United States;

•

The nature and extent of future competition;

•

The extent of future or pending healthcare reform and
    regulation, including cost containment measures and changes in
    reimbursement policies, procedures and rates;

•

Increases in our cost of borrowing as a result of changes in
    interest rates and other factors;

•

The ability of our operators and managers, as applicable, to
    deliver high quality services, to attract and retain qualified
    personnel and to attract residents and patients;

•

Changes in general economic conditions

and/or

economic conditions in the markets in which we may, from time to
    time, compete, and the effect of those changes on our revenues
    and our ability to access the capital markets or other sources
    of funds;

•

Our ability to pay down, refinance, restructure

and/or

extend our indebtedness as it becomes due;

•

Our ability and willingness to maintain our qualification as a
    REIT due to economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations;

•

Final determination of our taxable net income for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 and for the year ending December 31,
    2011;

•

The ability and willingness of our tenants to renew their leases
    with us upon expiration of the leases and our ability to
    reposition our properties on the same or better terms in the
    event such leases expire and are not renewed by our tenants or
    in the event we exercise our right to replace an existing tenant
    upon a default;

i


•

Risks associated with our senior living operating portfolio,
    such as factors causing volatility in our operating income and
    earnings generated by our properties, including without
    limitation national and regional economic conditions, costs of
    materials, energy, labor and services, employee benefit costs,
    insurance costs and professional and general liability claims,
    and the timely delivery of accurate property-level financial
    results for those properties;

•

The movement of U.S. and Canadian exchange rates;

•

Year-over-year

changes in the Consumer Price Index and the effect of those
    changes on the rent escalators, including the rent escalator for
    Master Lease 2 with Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (together with its
    subsidiaries, “Kindred”), and our earnings;

•

Our ability and the ability of our tenants, operators, borrowers
    and managers to obtain and maintain adequate liability and other
    insurance from reputable and financially stable providers;

•

The impact of increased operating costs and uninsured
    professional liability claims on the liquidity, financial
    condition and results of operations of our tenants, operators,
    borrowers and managers and the ability of our tenants,
    operators, borrowers and managers to accurately estimate the
    magnitude of those claims;

•

Risks associated with our medical office building
    (“MOB”) portfolio and operations, including our
    ability to successfully design, develop and manage MOBs, to
    accurately estimate our costs in

fee-for-service

projects and to retain key personnel;

•

The ability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses our MOBs
    are located and their affiliated health systems to remain
    competitive and financially viable and to attract physicians and
    physician groups;

•

Our ability to maintain or expand our relationships with our
    existing and future hospital and health system clients;

•

Risks associated with our investments in joint ventures and
    unconsolidated entities, including our lack of sole
    decision-making authority and our reliance on our joint venture
    partners’ financial condition;

•

The impact of market or issuer events on the liquidity or value
    of our investments in marketable securities; and

•

The impact of any financial, accounting, legal or regulatory
    issues or litigation that may affect us or our major tenants,
    operators, and managers.

Many of these factors, some of which are described in greater
    detail under “Risk Factors” in Part I,
    Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

are beyond our control and the control of our management.

PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

BUSINESS

Overview

We are a REIT with a geographically diverse portfolio of seniors
    housing and healthcare properties in the United States and
    Canada. As of December 31, 2010, our portfolio consisted of
    602 assets: 240 seniors housing communities, 187 skilled nursing
    facilities, 40 hospitals and 135 medical office buildings
    (“MOBs”) and other properties in 43 U.S. states,
    the District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces. With the
    exception of our seniors housing communities that are managed by
    independent third parties, such as Sunrise, pursuant to
    long-term management agreements and certain of our MOBs,
    including those acquired in connection with our Lillibridge
    Healthcare Services, Inc. (“Lillibridge”) acquisition
    (see “Note 4 — Acquisitions of Real Estate
    Property” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K),

we lease our properties to healthcare operating companies under

“triple-net”

or

“absolute-net”

leases, which require the tenants to pay all property-related
    expenses. We also had real estate loan and other investments
    relating to seniors housing and healthcare companies or
    properties as of December 31, 2010.

Our primary business consists of acquiring, financing and owning
    seniors housing and healthcare properties and leasing those
    properties to third parties or operating those properties
    through independent third party managers. Through our
    Lillibridge subsidiary, we also provide management, leasing,
    marketing, facility development and advisory services to highly
    rated hospitals and health systems throughout the United States.

In October 2010, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire
    substantially all of the real estate assets of privately-owned
    Atria Senior Living Group, Inc. (together with its affiliates,
    “Atria”) for a total purchase price of
    $3.1 billion, comprised of $1.35 billion of our common
    stock (a fixed 24.96 million shares), $150 million in
    cash and the assumption or repayment of $1.6 billion of net
    debt. We will acquire from Atria 118 private pay seniors housing
    communities located primarily in affluent coastal markets such
    as the New York metropolitan area, New England and
    California. Atria, based in Louisville, Kentucky, is owned by
    private equity funds managed by Lazard Real Estate Partners.
    Prior to the closing, Atria will spin off its management
    company, which will continue to operate the acquired assets
    under long-term management agreements with us. Completion of the
    transaction is subject to certain conditions. We expect to
    complete the transaction in the first half of 2011, although we
    cannot assure you that the transaction will close on such
    timetable or at all.

We were incorporated in Kentucky in 1983, commenced operations
    in 1985 and reorganized as a Delaware corporation in 1987. We
    operate through three reportable business segments:

triple-net

leased properties, senior living operations and MOB operations.
    See our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes,
    including “Note 2 — Accounting
    Policies,” included in Part II, Item 8 of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Business
    Strategy

Our business strategy is comprised of three principal
    objectives: (1) generating consistent, reliable and growing
    cash flows; (2) maintaining a well-diversified portfolio;
    and (3) preserving our investment grade balance sheet and
    liquidity.

Consistent,
    Reliable and Growing Cash Flows

Our primary objective is to enhance shareholder value by
    generating consistent, reliable and growing cash flows through
    healthcare and seniors housing assets. To achieve this
    objective, we seek to balance our portfolio of healthcare and
    seniors housing properties with a combination of long-term

triple-net

leases that provide steady contractual growth, seniors housing
    operating assets that provide higher growth potential and MOBs
    that provide long-term stable cash flows.



Well-Diversified
    Portfolio

We believe that maintaining a portfolio of properties and real
    estate loan investments diversified by asset class,
    tenant/operator, geography, revenue source and business model
    makes us less susceptible to regional economic downturns and
    adverse changes in regulation or reimbursement rates or
    methodologies in any single state. Portfolio diversification
    also reduces our exposure to any single tenant/operator and the
    risk that a single event could materially harm our business.

Investment
    Grade Balance Sheet and Liquidity

Having a strong balance sheet and liquidity positions us
    favorably for growth and also reduces risk. We seek to protect
    our capital and invest profitably by actively managing our
    leverage, lowering our cost of capital and maintaining multiple
    sources of liquidity, such as unsecured bank debt, mortgage
    financings and access to the public debt and equity markets.

Portfolio
    of Properties and Other Investments

As of December 31, 2010, we had: 100% ownership interests
    in 538 of our properties, including all 79 of our seniors
    housing communities managed by Sunrise; controlling interests in
    six MOBs owned through joint ventures with partners who provide
    management and leasing services for the properties; and
    noncontrolling interests ranging between 5% and 20% in 58 MOBs
    owned through joint ventures with institutional third party
    partners. Through our Lillibridge subsidiary, we also managed an
    additional 31 MOBs for third parties as of December 31,
    2010.

The following table provides an overview of our portfolio of
    properties and other investments as of and for the year ended

Seniors
    Housing and Healthcare Properties

Seniors Housing Communities

.

Our
    seniors housing communities include independent and assisted
    living communities, and communities providing care for
    individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of
    dementia or memory loss. These communities offer residential
    units on a

month-to-month

basis primarily to elderly individuals requiring various levels
    of assistance. Basic services for residents of these communities
    include housekeeping, meals in a central dining area and group
    activities organized by the staff with input from the residents.
    More extensive care and personal supervision, at additional
    fees, are also available for such needs as eating, bathing,
    grooming, transportation, limited therapeutic programs and
    medication administration, all of which encourage the residents
    to live as independently as possible according to their
    abilities. These services are often met by home health
    providers, close coordination with the resident’s physician
    and skilled nursing facilities.

Skilled Nursing Facilities

.

Our
    skilled nursing facilities typically provide nursing care
    services to the elderly and rehabilitation and restoration
    services, including physical, occupational and speech therapies,
    and other medical treatment for patients and residents who do
    not require the high technology, care-intensive setting of an
    acute care or rehabilitation hospital.

Hospitals

.

Substantially all of our
    hospitals are operated as long-term acute care hospitals, which
    are hospitals that have a Medicare average length of stay
    greater than 25 days that serve medically complex,
    chronically ill patients who require a high level of monitoring
    and specialized care, but whose conditions do not necessitate
    the continued services of an intensive care unit. The operators
    of these hospitals have the capability to treat patients who
    suffer from multiple systemic failures or conditions such as
    neurological disorders, head injuries, brain stem and spinal
    cord trauma, cerebral vascular accidents, chemical brain
    injuries, central nervous system disorders, developmental
    anomalies and cardiopulmonary disorders. Chronic patients are
    often dependent on technology for continued life support, such
    as mechanical ventilators, total parenteral nutrition,
    respiration or cardiac monitors and dialysis machines, and,
    therefore, due to their severe medical conditions, these
    patients generally are not clinically appropriate for admission
    to a nursing facility or rehabilitation hospital. Our hospitals
    are freestanding facilities, and we do not own any
    “hospitals within hospitals.” We also own two
    rehabilitation hospitals devoted to the rehabilitation of
    patients with various neurological, musculoskeletal, orthopedic
    and other medical conditions following stabilization of their
    acute medical issues.

Medical Office Buildings

.

Our MOBs
    offer office space primarily to physicians and other healthcare
    businesses. While these properties are similar to commercial
    office buildings, they require more plumbing, electrical and
    mechanical systems to accommodate multiple physicians’
    offices and examination rooms that may have sinks in every room,
    brighter lights and specialized medical equipment. MOBs are
    typically multi-tenant properties leased to multiple healthcare
    providers (hospitals and physician practices). As of
    December 31, 2010, our owned and managed MOB portfolio
    consisted of over 8.8 million square feet.

Other Properties

.

Our other properties
    consist of personal care facilities, which provide specialized
    care, including supported living services, neurorehabilitation,
    neurobehavioral management and vocational programs, for persons
    with acquired or traumatic brain injury.

Other
    Investments

As of December 31, 2010, we had $149.3 million of net
    loans receivable secured by seniors housing and healthcare
    companies or properties. See “Note 6 — Loans
    Receivable” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

As of December 31, 2010, we also had marketable debt
    securities classified as

available-for-sale,

with a cost basis of $61.9 million and a fair market value
    of $66.7 million.

Geographic
    Diversification

Our portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare properties is
    broadly diversified by geographic location in the United States
    and Canada, with properties in only two states comprising more
    than 10% of our 2010 total



revenues. The following table shows our rental income and
    resident fees and services derived by geographic location for
    our portfolio of properties for the year ended December 31,

    excluded from this presentation.

Segment
    Information

As of December 31, 2010, we operated through three
    reportable business segments:

triple-net

leased properties, senior living operations and MOB operations.
    See “Note 19 — Segment Information” of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for more information about our business segments and the
    geographic diversification of our portfolio of properties.

Certificates
    of Need

A majority of our skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are
    located in states that have certificate of need
    (“CON”) requirements. A CON, which is issued by a
    governmental agency with jurisdiction over healthcare
    facilities, is at times required for expansion of existing
    facilities, construction of new facilities, addition of beds,
    acquisition of major items of equipment or introduction of new
    services. The CON rules and regulations may restrict our or our
    operators’ ability to expand our properties in certain
    circumstances.

The following table shows the percentage of our rental income
    derived by skilled nursing facilities and hospitals in states
    with and without CON requirements for the year ended

Significant
    Tenants, Operators and Managers

As of December 31, 2010, approximately 37.9%, 19.7% and
    13.1% of our properties, based on the gross book value of real
    estate investments, were managed or operated by Sunrise,
    Brookdale Senior Living and Kindred, respectively. For the year
    ended December 31, 2010 (including amounts in discontinued
    operations):

•

our senior living operations managed by Sunrise accounted for
    approximately 43.4% of our total revenues and 22.7% of our total
    earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
    (including non-cash stock-based compensation), excluding
    merger-related expenses and deal costs, gains and losses on real
    estate disposals and asset impairments

and/or

valuation allowances (“Adjusted EBITDA”);

•

our four master lease agreements with Kindred (the “Kindred
    Master Leases”) accounted for approximately 24.2% of our
    total revenues and 35.6% of our total net operating income
    (“NOI,” which is defined as total revenues, less
    interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and
    MOB services costs); and

•

our leases with Brookdale Senior Living accounted for
    approximately 11.9% of our total revenues and 17.3% of our total
    NOI.

Triple-Net

Leased Properties

Each of our Kindred Master Leases and our leases with Brookdale
    Senior Living is a

triple-net

lease pursuant to which the tenant is required to pay all taxes,
    utilities and maintenance and repairs related to the properties
    and to maintain and pay all insurance covering the properties
    and their operations. In addition, the tenants are required to
    comply with the terms of the mortgage financing documents, if
    any, affecting the properties.

In view of the fact that Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living
    lease a substantial portion of our

triple-net

leased properties and each contributes a significant portion of
    our total revenues and NOI, Kindred’s and Brookdale Senior
    Living’s financial condition and ability and willingness to
    satisfy their obligations under their respective leases and
    other agreements with us, and their willingness to renew those
    leases upon expiration of the initial base terms thereof,
    significantly impact our results of operations and ability to
    service our indebtedness and to make distributions to our
    stockholders. We cannot assure you that either Kindred or
    Brookdale Senior Living will have sufficient assets, income and
    access to financing to enable it to satisfy those obligations,
    and any inability or unwillingness on its part to do so would
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition, results of operations and liquidity, on our ability
    to service our indebtedness and other obligations and on our
    ability to make distributions to our stockholders, as required
    for us to continue to qualify as a REIT (a “Material
    Adverse Effect”). We also cannot assure you that either
    Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living will elect to renew its
    leases with us upon expiration of the initial base terms or any
    renewal terms thereof or that, if some or all of those leases
    are not renewed, we will be able to reposition the affected
    properties on a timely basis or on the same or better terms, if
    at all. See “Risks Factors — Risks Arising from
    Our Business — We depend on Kindred and Brookdale
    Senior Living for a significant portion of our revenues and
    operating income; Any inability or unwillingness by Kindred or
    Brookdale Senior Living to satisfy its obligations under its
    agreements with us could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    us” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Kindred Master Leases

.  We lease 197
    properties to Kindred. The aggregate annual rent we receive
    under each Kindred Master Lease is referred to as “Base
    Rent.” Base Rent escalates on May 1 of each year at a
    specified rate over the “Prior Period Base Rent” (as
    defined in the applicable Kindred Master Lease), contingent upon
    the satisfaction of specified facility revenue parameters. The
    annual rent escalator is 2.7% under Kindred Master Leases 1, 3
    and 4. The annual rent escalator under Kindred Master Lease 2 is
    based on

year-over-year

changes in the Consumer Price Index, with a floor of 2.25% and a
    ceiling of 4%. Assuming the applicable facility revenue
    parameters are met, we currently expect that Base Rent due under
    the Kindred Master Leases will be approximately
    $254.9 million from May 1, 2011 through April 30,
    2012. See “Note 3 — Concentration of Credit
    Risk” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



The properties we lease to Kindred pursuant to the Kindred
    Master Leases are grouped into bundles that contain a varying
    number of properties. All properties within a single bundle have
    the same primary lease term of ten to fifteen years from
    May 1, 1998 and, provided certain conditions are satisfied,
    are subject to three five-year renewal terms. Kindred has
    renewed, through April 30, 2013, its leases covering all
    57 properties owned by us with a primary lease term that
    expired on April 30, 2008. Kindred has also renewed,
    through April 30, 2015, its leases covering all 109
    properties owned by us (one of which we subsequently sold in
    June 2009) with a primary lease term that expired on
    April 30, 2010. Kindred retains two sequential five-year
    renewal options for all 165 of these assets.

The current lease term for each of ten bundles covering 89
    properties leased to Kindred will expire on April 30, 2013
    unless Kindred provides us with renewal notices with respect to
    those individual bundles on or before April 30, 2012. The
    ten bundles expiring in 2013 currently represent
    $120 million of annual Base Rent from May 1, 2010
    through April 30, 2011. Each bundle contains six or more
    properties, including at least one hospital. Kindred is required
    to continue to perform all of its obligations under the
    applicable lease for the properties within any bundle that is
    not renewed until expiration of the term on April 30, 2013,
    including without limitation, payment of all rental amounts.
    Therefore, for any bundles that are not renewed, we will have at
    least one year to arrange for the repositioning of the
    applicable properties with new operators. In addition, we own or
    have the rights to all licenses and CONs at the properties, and
    Kindred has extensive and detailed obligations to cooperate and
    ensure an orderly transition of the properties to another
    operator. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you, if Kindred does
    not renew one or more bundles, that we would be successful in
    identifying suitable replacement operators or that we will be
    able to enter into leases with new tenants or operators on terms
    as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all. See
    “Risk Factors — Risks Arising from Our
    Business — We may be unable to reposition our
    properties on as favorable terms, or at all, if we have to
    replace any of our tenants or operators, and we may be subject
    to delays, limitations and expenses in repositioning our
    assets” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Brookdale Senior Living Leases

.  Our
    leases with Brookdale have primary terms of fifteen years, which
    commenced January 28, 2004 (in the case of ten “Grand
    Court” properties we acquired in 2004) or
    October 19, 2004 (in the case of the properties we acquired
    in connection with our Provident Senior Living Trust
    (“Provident”) acquisition), and, provided certain
    conditions are satisfied, are subject to two ten-year renewal
    terms. Our leases with Alterra also have primary terms of
    fifteen years, which commenced October 20, 2004 or
    December 16, 2004 (both in the case of properties we
    acquired in connection with our Provident acquisition), and,
    provided certain conditions are satisfied, are subject to two
    five-year renewal terms. Brookdale Senior Living guarantees all
    of Brookdale’s and Alterra’s obligations under these
    leases, and all of our Brookdale Senior Living leases are
    cross-defaulted.

Under the terms of the Brookdale leases we assumed in connection
    with our Provident acquisition, Brookdale is obligated to pay
    base rent, which escalates on January 1 of each year by an
    amount equal to the lesser of (i) four times the percentage
    increase in the Consumer Price Index during the immediately
    preceding year or (ii) 3%. Under the terms of the Brookdale
    leases with respect to our “Grand Court” properties,
    Brookdale is obligated to pay base rent, which escalates on
    February 1 of each year by an amount equal to the greater of
    (i) 2% or (ii) 75% of the increase in the Consumer
    Price Index during the immediately preceding year. Under the
    terms of the Alterra leases, Alterra is obligated to pay base
    rent, which escalates on January 1 or November 1 of each year by
    an amount equal to the lesser of (i) four times the
    percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index during the
    immediately preceding year or (ii) 2.5%. The aggregate
    annual contractual cash base rent expected from Brookdale Senior
    Living for 2011 is approximately $113.1 million, excluding
    variable interest Brookdale is obligated to pay as additional
    rent based on certain floating rate mortgage debt assumed by us
    in connection with our Provident acquisition. The aggregate
    annual contractual base rent (computed in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”)), excluding the variable interest, expected
    from Brookdale Senior Living for 2011 is approximately
    $117.2 million. See “Note 3 —
    Concentration of Credit Risk” and
    “Note 13 — Commitments and
    Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.



Senior
    Living Operations

Sunrise currently provides comprehensive accounting and property
    management services with respect to 79 of our seniors housing
    communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. Each
    management agreement has a term of 30 years from its
    effective date, the earliest of which began in 2004. In December
    2010, we and Sunrise modified the management agreements to,
    among other things, reduce the management fee paid to Sunrise
    for the period from April 1, 2010 through December 31,
    2010 and for all of 2011 to 3.50% and 3.75% per annum,
    respectively, after which the annual base management fee will
    equal 6% of revenues (with a range of 5% to 7%), cap the amount
    of incentive management fees payable to Sunrise and allocated
    “shared services” expenses, provide enhanced rights
    and remedies for us in the event of a Sunrise default and
    reallocate the NOI performance thresholds to include a cushion
    for all 79 communities. See “Note 3 —
    Concentration of Credit Risk” of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Although we have various rights as owner under the Sunrise
    management agreements, we rely on Sunrise’s personnel, good
    faith, expertise, historical performance, technical resources
    and information systems, proprietary information and judgment to
    manage our seniors housing communities efficiently and
    effectively. We also rely on Sunrise to set resident fees and
    otherwise operate those properties in compliance with our
    management agreements. Because Sunrise manages a significant
    portion of our properties, Sunrise’s inability to
    efficiently and effectively manage those properties and to
    provide timely and accurate accounting information with respect
    thereto could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. In addition,
    Sunrise’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its
    obligations under our management agreements, changes in
    Sunrise’s senior management or any adverse developments in
    Sunrise’s business and affairs or financial condition could
    have a Material Adverse Effect on us. See “Risk
    Factors — Risks Arising from Our Business —
    The properties managed by Sunrise account for a significant
    portion of our revenues and operating income; Adverse
    developments in Sunrise’s business and affairs or financial
    condition could have a Material Adverse Effect on us”
    included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Competition

We generally compete for real property investments with other
    healthcare REITs, healthcare operators, healthcare lenders,
    developers, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance
    companies, pension funds, private equity firms and other
    investors. Some of our competitors may have greater financial
    resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased
    competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and
    successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our
    objectives. Our ability to compete successfully for real
    property investments is affected by, among other factors, the
    availability of suitable acquisition or investment targets, our
    ability to negotiate acceptable acquisition or investment terms
    and our access to and cost of capital. See “Risk
    Factors — Risks Arising from Our Business —
    We may encounter certain risks when implementing our business
    strategy to pursue investments in,

and/or

acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing

and/or

healthcare assets” included in Item 1A of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

and “Note 9 — Borrowing Arrangements”
    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Revenues from our properties are dependent on the ability of the
    operators and managers of those properties to compete with other
    seniors housing and healthcare operators and managers. Operators
    and managers compete on a local and regional basis for
    residents, tenants and patients based on several factors. The
    operators and managers of our seniors housing communities,
    skilled nursing facilities and hospitals compete to attract and
    retain residents and patients based on the scope and quality of
    care and services provided, their ability to attract and retain
    qualified personnel, their reputation and financial condition,
    price, location and physical appearance of the properties,
    physician referrals and family preferences. The managers of our
    medical office buildings compete to attract and retain tenants
    based on many of the same factors, in addition to the quality of
    the affiliated health system, physician preferences and
    proximity to hospital campuses. Private, federal and state
    reimbursement programs and the effect of other laws and
    regulations also may have a significant impact on our
    operators’ and managers’ ability to compete
    successfully for residents, tenants and patients at our
    properties. See “Risk Factors — Risks Arising
    from Our Business — Our tenants,



operators and managers may be adversely affected by increasing
    healthcare regulation and enforcement” and
    “— Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods
    of payment from third-party payors, including the Medicare and
    Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on
    certain of our tenants and operators” included in
    Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, we had 263 full-time
    employees, including 196 employees at our Lillibridge
    subsidiary. We consider our relationship with our employees to
    be good.

Insurance

We maintain

and/or

require in our existing leases and other agreements that our
    tenants, operators and managers maintain all applicable lines of
    insurance on our properties and their operations. For example,
    pursuant to the terms of the Kindred Master Leases, Kindred is
    required to maintain, at its expense, specified types and
    minimum levels of insurance coverage related to the leased
    properties and Kindred’s operations at those properties. We
    believe that our tenants, operators and managers are in
    compliance with the insurance requirements contained in their
    respective leases and other agreements with us; however, we
    cannot assure you that such parties will maintain the required
    insurance coverages, and the failure by any of them to do so
    could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. We also cannot
    assure you that we will continue to require the same levels of
    insurance coverage under our leases and other agreements.

We maintain casualty insurance for our seniors housing
    communities managed by Sunrise, but Sunrise currently maintains
    the general and professional liability insurance covering those
    properties and their related operations in accordance with the
    standards contained in our management agreements. Under the
    management agreements, we may elect, on an annual basis, whether
    we or Sunrise will bear responsibility for maintaining the
    required insurance coverage for our Sunrise-managed properties,
    but the costs of such insurance are facility expenses paid from
    the revenues of those properties, regardless of who maintains
    the insurance.

As part of our MOB development business, we provide engineering,
    construction and architectural services, and design,
    construction or systems failures may result in substantial
    injury or damage to clients

and/or

third
    parties. Injury or damage claims may arise in the ordinary
    course and may be asserted with respect to ongoing or completed
    projects. Although we maintain liability insurance, if any claim
    results in a loss, we cannot assure you that our insurance
    coverage would be adequate to cover the loss in full. If we
    sustain losses in excess of our insurance coverage, we may be
    required to make a payment for the difference and could lose our
    investment in, and/or experience reduced profits and cash flows
    from, the affected MOB, which could have a Material Adverse
    Effect on us.

We believe that the amount and scope of insurance coverage
    provided by our policies and the policies maintained by our
    tenants, operators and managers are customary for similarly
    situated companies in our industry. We cannot assure you that in
    the future we or our tenants, operators and managers will be
    able to maintain the same levels of insurance coverage or that
    such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost. In
    addition, we cannot give any assurances as to the future
    financial viability of our insurers or that the insurance
    coverage provided will fully cover all losses on our properties
    upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event.

In an effort to reduce and manage costs and for various other
    reasons, many healthcare providers are pursuing different
    organizational and corporate structures coupled with
    self-insurance programs that may provide them with less
    insurance coverage. As a result, the tenants, operators and
    managers of our properties could incur large funded and unfunded
    professional liability expense, which could have a material
    adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition and
    results of operations and, in turn, on their ability to make
    rental payments under, or otherwise comply with the terms of,
    their respective leases and other agreements with us, which
    could adversely affect our results of operations.

GOVERNMENTAL
    REGULATION

Healthcare
    Regulation

Overview

While the properties within our portfolio are all susceptible to
    many varying types of regulation, we expect that the healthcare
    industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation
    and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost
    control, healthcare management and provision of services, among
    others. A significant expansion of applicable federal, state or
    local laws and regulations, previously enacted or future
    healthcare reform, new interpretations of existing laws and
    regulations or changes in enforcement priorities could have a
    material adverse effect on certain of our operators’
    liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which,
    in turn, could adversely impact their ability to satisfy their
    contractual obligations, including making rental payments under,
    or otherwise complying with the terms of, their leases with us.
    In addition, efforts by third-party payors, such as the federal
    Medicare program, state Medicaid programs and private insurance
    carriers, including health maintenance organizations and other
    health plans, to impose greater discounts and more stringent
    cost controls upon operators (through changes in reimbursement
    rates and methodologies, discounted fee structures, the
    assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the
    financial risk or otherwise) are expected to intensify and
    continue. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed
    and on reimbursement rates and fees could also have a material
    adverse effect on certain of our operators’ liquidity,
    financial condition and results of operations, which could
    affect adversely their ability to satisfy their contractual
    obligations, including making rental payments under, and
    otherwise complying with the terms of, their leases with us.

Licensure
    and Certification

Participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs generally
    requires the operators of our skilled nursing facilities to be
    licensed on an annual or bi-annual basis and certified annually
    through various regulatory agencies that determine compliance
    with federal, state and local laws. These legal requirements
    relate to the quality of the nursing care provided,
    qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing
    staff, the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment and
    continuing compliance with the laws and regulations governing
    the operation of skilled nursing facilities. The failure of an
    operator to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory
    approval or to correct serious deficiencies identified in
    compliance surveys could prevent it from continuing operations
    at a property. A loss of licensure or certification could also
    adversely affect a skilled nursing facility operator’s
    ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs, which, in turn, could affect adversely their ability
    to satisfy their contractual obligations, including making
    rental payments under, and otherwise complying with the terms
    of, their leases with us.

Similarly, in order to receive Medicare and Medicaid
    reimbursement, our hospitals must meet the applicable conditions
    of participation set forth by the U.S. Department of Health
    and Human Services



(“HHS”) relating to the type of hospital and its
    equipment, personnel and standard of medical care, as well as
    comply with state and local laws and regulations. Hospitals
    undergo periodic

on-site

licensure surveys, which generally are limited if the hospital
    is accredited by The Joint Commission (formerly the Joint
    Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) or
    other recognized accreditation organizations. A loss of
    licensure or certification could adversely affect a
    hospital’s ability to receive payments from the Medicare
    and Medicaid programs, which, in turn, could adversely affect
    their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations,
    including making rental payments under, and otherwise complying
    with the terms of, their leases with us.

Seniors housing communities are subject to relatively few, if
    any, federal regulations. Instead, to the extent they are
    regulated, the regulation is conducted mainly by state and local
    laws governing licensure, provision of services, staffing
    requirements and other operational matters. These laws vary
    greatly from one jurisdiction to another. Although recent growth
    in the U.S. seniors housing industry has attracted the
    attention of various federal agencies that believe more federal
    regulation of these properties is necessary, thus far, Congress
    has deferred to state regulation of seniors housing communities.
    However, as a result of this growth and increased federal
    scrutiny, some states have revised and strengthened their
    regulation of seniors housing communities, and more states are
    expected to do the same in the future.

Certificates
    of Need

Skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are subject to various
    state CON laws requiring governmental approval prior to the
    development or expansion of healthcare facilities and services.
    The approval process in these states generally requires a
    facility to demonstrate the need for additional or expanded
    healthcare facilities or services. CONs, where applicable, are
    sometimes necessary for expansion of existing facilities,
    construction of new facilities, changes in ownership or control
    of licensed facilities, addition of beds, investment in major
    capital equipment, introduction of new services or termination
    of services previously approved through the CON process. These
    CON laws and regulations may restrict an operator’s ability
    to expand our properties and grow its business in certain
    circumstances, which could have an effect on the operator’s
    revenues and, in turn, adversely impact us. In addition, in the
    event that any operator of our properties fails to make rental
    payments to us or to comply with applicable healthcare
    regulations, our ability to evict that operator and substitute
    another operator for a particular facility may be materially
    delayed or limited by CON laws, as well as by various state
    licensing and receivership laws and Medicare and Medicaid

change-of-ownership

rules. Such delays and limitations could have a material adverse
    effect on our ability to collect rent, to obtain possession of
    leased properties, or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant
    default. We may also incur substantial additional expenses in
    connection with any such licensing, receivership or

change-of-ownership

proceedings.

Fraud
    and Abuse

Various federal and state laws and regulations prohibit a wide
    variety of fraud and abuse by healthcare providers who
    participate in, receive payments from or make or receive
    referrals for work in connection with government-funded
    healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The
    federal laws include, by way of example, the following:

•

The anti-kickback statute (Section 1128B(b) of the Social
    Security Act), which prohibits certain business practices and
    relationships, including the payment, receipt or solicitation of
    any remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce a referral
    of any patient or service or item covered by a federal health
    care program, including Medicare or a state health program, such
    as Medicaid;

•

The physician self-referral prohibition (Ethics in Patient
    Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the “Stark
    Law”), which prohibits referrals by physicians of Medicare
    or Medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated
    healthcare services with which the physicians (or their
    immediate family members) have ownership interests or certain
    other financial arrangements;

•

The False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly
    presenting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal
    government (including the Medicare and Medicaid programs);



•

The Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which authorizes HHS to impose
    civil penalties administratively for fraudulent acts; and

•

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
    (commonly referred to as “HIPAA”), which among other
    things, protects the privacy and security of individually
    identifiable health information by limiting its use and
    disclosure.

Sanctions for violating these federal laws include criminal and
    civil penalties such as punitive sanctions, damage assessments,
    monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and
    Medicaid payments,

and/or

exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These laws
    also impose an affirmative duty on operators to ensure that they
    do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the
    Medicare and other government programs.

Many states have adopted or are considering legislative
    proposals similar to the federal anti-fraud and abuse laws, some
    of which extend beyond the Medicare and Medicaid programs, to
    prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral
    of patients and physician self-referrals, regardless of whether
    the service was reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid. Many states
    have also adopted or are considering legislative proposals to
    increase patient protections, such as minimum staffing levels,
    criminal background checks, and limiting the use and disclosure
    of patient specific health information. These state laws also
    impose criminal and civil penalties similar to the federal laws.

In the ordinary course of their business, the operators of our
    properties have been and are subject regularly to inquiries,
    investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that
    oversee applicable laws and regulations. Increased funding
    through recent federal and state legislation has led to
    significant growth in the number of investigations and
    enforcement actions over the past several years. Private
    enforcement of healthcare fraud has also increased, due in large
    part to amendments to the civil False Claims Act in 1986 that
    were designed to encourage private individuals to sue on behalf
    of the government. These whistleblower suits by private
    individuals, known as qui tam suits, may be filed by almost
    anyone, including present and former patients or nurses and
    other employees. HIPAA also created a series of new healthcare
    crimes.

As federal and state budget pressures continue, administrative
    agencies may continue to escalate their investigation and
    enforcement efforts to eliminate waste and to control fraud and
    abuse in governmental healthcare programs. A violation of any of
    these federal and state anti-fraud and abuse laws and
    regulations by an operator of our properties could have a
    material adverse effect on the operator’s liquidity,
    financial condition or results of operations, which could
    adversely their ability to satisfy their contractual
    obligations, including making rental payments under, and
    otherwise complying with the terms of, their leases with us.

Healthcare
    Legislation

In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient
    Protection and Affordable Care Act, along with a reconciliation
    measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of
    2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”). The
    passage of the Affordable Care Act has resulted in comprehensive
    reform legislation that is expected to expand health care
    coverage to millions of currently uninsured people beginning in
    2014. To help fund this expansion, the Affordable Care Act
    outlines certain reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates for
    various healthcare providers, including long-term acute care
    hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, as well as certain
    other changes to Medicare payment methodologies.

The Affordable Care Act, among other things, reduces the
    inflationary market basket increase included in standard federal
    payment rates for long-term acute care hospitals by
    25 basis points in fiscal year 2010, 50 basis points
    in fiscal year 2011, 10 basis points in fiscal years 2012
    and 2013, 30 basis points in fiscal year 2014,
    20 basis points in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, and
    75 basis points in fiscal years 2017 through 2019. In
    addition, under the Affordable Care Act, long-term acute care
    hospitals and skilled nursing facilities will be subject to a
    rate adjustment to the market basket increase, beginning in
    fiscal year 2012, to reflect improvements in productivity.

Healthcare is one of the largest industries in the United States
    and continues to attract a great deal of legislative interest
    and public attention. We cannot assure you that previously
    enacted or future healthcare



reform legislation or changes in the administration or
    implementation of governmental and non-governmental healthcare
    reimbursement programs will not have a material adverse effect
    on our operators’ liquidity, financial condition or results
    of operations, or on their ability to satisfy their obligations
    to us, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    us.

Medicare
    Reimbursement; Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (“BBA”) mandated the
    creation of a prospective payment system for long-term acute
    care hospitals (“LTAC PPS”), which became effective on
    October 1, 2002 for cost reporting periods commencing on or
    after that date. Under LTAC PPS, which classifies patients into
    distinct diagnostic groups based on clinical characteristics and
    expected resource needs, long-term acute care hospitals are
    reimbursed on a predetermined rate, rather than on a reasonable
    cost basis that reflects costs incurred. LTAC PPS requires
    payment for a Medicare beneficiary at a predetermined, per
    discharge amount for each defined patient category (called
    “Long-Term Care — Diagnosis Related Groups”
    or “LTC-DRGs”), adjusted for differences in area wage
    levels.

Updates to LTAC PPS payment rates are established by regulators
    and published annually for the long-term acute care hospital
    rate year, which historically has been July 1 through
    June 30. However, starting with the 2010 rate year, which
    commenced October 1, 2009, annual rate updates now coincide
    with annual updates to the LTC-DRG classification system, which
    correspond to the federal fiscal year (October 1 through
    September 30).

The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (Pub. L.

No. 110-173)

(the “Medicare Extension Act”) significantly expanded
    medical necessity reviews by the Centers for
    Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) by
    requiring long-term acute care hospitals to institute a patient
    review process to better assess patients upon admission and on a
    continuing basis for appropriateness of care. In addition, the
    Medicare Extension Act, among other things, provided the
    following long-term acute care hospital payment policy changes,
    all of which were extended for two years by the Affordable Care
    Act:

•

It prevented CMS from applying the “25-percent rule,”
    which limits payments from referring co-located hospitals, to
    freestanding and grandfathered long-term acute care hospitals
    for three years;

•

It modified the application of the 25-percent rule to certain
    urban and rural long-term acute care
    “hospitals-within-hospitals” and “satellite”
    facilities for three years;

•

It prevented CMS from applying the “very short stay
    outlier” policy for three years; and

•

It prevented CMS from making any one-time adjustments to correct
    estimates used in implementing LTAC PPS for three years.

Lastly, the Medicare Extension Act introduced a moratorium on
    new long-term acute care hospitals and beds for three years.

On May 22, 2008, CMS published a final rule addressing two
    LTAC PPS payment policies mandated by the Medicare Extension
    Act. The rule delayed the extension of the 25-percent rule to
    freestanding and grandfathered long-term acute care hospitals
    and increased the patient percentage thresholds for certain
    urban and rural long-term acute care
    “hospitals-within-hospitals” and “satellite”
    facilities for three years. The rule also set forth policies on
    implementing the moratorium on new long-term acute care
    hospitals and beds imposed by the Medicare Extension Act.

On August 27, 2009, CMS published a final rule which
    finalized policies to implement changes required by
    Section 124 of the Medicare Improvements for
    Patients & Providers Act of 2008 (Pub. L.

No. 110-275).

This rule continued reforms intended to improve the accuracy of
    Medicare payments for inpatient acute care through the
    severity-adjusted diagnosis-related group (MS-LTC-DRG)
    classification system for long-term acute care hospitals.

On August 16, 2010, CMS published its final rule updating
    LTAC PPS for the 2011 fiscal year (October 1, 2010 through
    September 30, 2011). Under the rule, the LTAC PPS standard
    federal payment rate in fiscal year



2011 reflects a 2.5% increase in the market basket index (before
    taking into account the 50 basis point reduction required
    by the Affordable Care Act), less a 2.5% adjustment to account
    for an increase in case-mix in fiscal year 2008 and 2009 that
    CMS attributes to changes in documentation and coding practices,
    rather than patient severity. CMS estimates that net payments to
    long-term acute care hospitals under the final rule would
    increase by approximately $22.3 million, or 0.5%, in fiscal
    year 2011 due to area wage adjustments, as well as increases in
    high-cost and short-stay outlier payments.

We regularly assess the financial implications of CMS’s
    rules on the operators of our long-term acute care hospitals,
    but we cannot assure you that the current rules or future
    updates to LTAC PPS, LTC-DRGs or Medicare reimbursement for
    long-term acute care hospitals will not materially adversely
    affect our operators, which, in turn, could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on us. See “Risk Factors — Risks
    Arising from Our Business — Changes in the
    reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party
    payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have
    a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and
    operators” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Medicare
    Reimbursement; Skilled Nursing Facilities

The BBA also mandated the creation of a prospective payment
    system for skilled nursing facilities (“SNF PPS”)
    offering Part A covered services. Under SNF PPS, payment
    amounts are based upon classifications determined through
    assessments of individual Medicare patients in the skilled
    nursing facility, rather than on the facility’s reasonable
    costs. SNF PPS payments are made on a per diem basis for each
    resident and are generally intended to cover all inpatient
    services for Medicare patients, including routine nursing care,
    most capital-related costs associated with the inpatient stay,
    and ancillary services, such as respiratory therapy,
    occupational and physical therapy, speech therapy and certain
    covered drugs.

In response to widespread healthcare industry concern about the
    reductions in payments under the BBA, the federal government
    enacted the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999
    (“BBRA”). The BBRA increased the per diem
    reimbursement rates for certain high acuity patients by 20% from
    April 1, 2000 until case mix refinements were implemented
    by CMS, as explained below. The BBRA also imposed a two-year
    moratorium on the annual cap mandated by the BBA on physical,
    occupational and speech therapy services provided to a patient
    by outpatient rehabilitation therapy providers, including
    Part B covered therapy services in nursing facilities.
    Relief from the BBA therapy caps was subsequently extended
    multiple times by Congress, but these extensions expired on
    December 31, 2009 and have not been renewed by Congress.

Pursuant to its final rule updating SNF PPS for the 2006 fiscal
    year, CMS refined the resource utilization groups
    (“RUGs”) used to determine the daily payment for
    beneficiaries in skilled nursing facilities by adding nine new
    payment categories. The result of this refinement, which became
    effective on January 1, 2006, was to eliminate the
    temporary add-on payments that Congress enacted as part of the
    BBRA.

Under its final rule updating LTC-DRGs for the 2007 fiscal year,
    CMS reduced reimbursement of uncollectible Medicare coinsurance
    amounts for all beneficiaries (other than beneficiaries of both
    Medicare and Medicaid) from 100% to 70% for skilled nursing
    facility cost reporting periods beginning on or after
    October 1, 2005. The rule also included various options for
    classifying and weighting patients transferred to a skilled
    nursing facility after a hospital stay less than the mean length
    of stay associated with that particular diagnosis-related group.

Under its final rule updating SNF PPS for the 2010 fiscal year
    CMS recalibrated the case-mix indexes for the resource
    utilization groups (RUGs) used to determine the daily payment
    for beneficiaries in skilled nursing facilities and implemented
    the RUG-IV classification model for skilled nursing facilities
    for fiscal year 2011; however, such implementation was delayed
    by the Affordable Care Act and will now occur in fiscal year
    2012.

On July 22, 2010, CMS published its notice updating SNF PPS
    for the 2011 fiscal year (October 1, 2010 through
    September 30, 2011). Under the notice, the update to the
    SNF PPS standard federal payment rate for skilled nursing
    facilities includes a 2.3% increase in the market basket index
    for the 2011 fiscal year. The notice also provides a 0.6%
    negative adjustment due to an overestimated increase in the
    market basket index for the 2009 fiscal year. CMS estimates that
    net payments to skilled nursing facilities as a result of the
    market



basket increase and the adjustment under the notice would
    increase by approximately $542 million, or 1.7%, in fiscal
    year 2011.

The notice includes other provisions, such as the introduction
    of concurrent therapy, implementation of the MDS 3.0 assessment
    tool, changes to the look-back period and modification of the
    implementation schedule for the RUG-IV classification model,
    that may additionally affect net payments to skilled nursing
    facilities.

On November 2, 2010, CMS placed on public display its final
    Medicare Physician Fee Schedule rule for the 2011 calendar year,
    which became effective on January 1, 2011. The rule set a
    $1,870 cap on physical therapy and

speech-language

pathology services and a separate $1,870 cap on occupational
    therapy services, including therapy provided in skilled nursing
    facilities, both without an exceptions process. Congress passed
    the Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010
    (Pub. L. No. 111 309), which was signed into
    law on December 15, 2010, to lift the caps on therapy
    services and continue the exceptions process.

We regularly assess the financial implications of CMS’s
    rules on the operators of our skilled nursing facilities, but we
    cannot assure you that the current rules or future updates to
    SNF PPS, therapy services or Medicare reimbursement for skilled
    nursing facilities will not materially adversely impact our
    operators, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect
    on us. See “Risk Factors — Risks Arising from Our
    Business — Changes in the reimbursement rates or
    methods of payment from third-party payors, including the
    Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse
    effect on certain of our tenants and operators” included in
    Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Medicaid
    Reimbursement; Skilled Nursing Facilities

Approximately two-thirds of all nursing home residents are
    dependent on Medicaid. Medicaid reimbursement rates, however,
    typically are less than the amounts charged by the operators of
    our skilled nursing facilities. Although the federal government
    and the states share responsibility for financing Medicaid,
    states have a wide range of discretion, within certain federal
    guidelines, to determine eligibility and reimbursement
    methodology. In addition, federal legislation limits an
    operator’s ability to withdraw from the Medicaid program by
    restricting the eviction or transfer of Medicaid residents. As
    state budget pressures continue to escalate as result of the
    financial crisis, a significant number of states have announced
    actual or potential budget shortfalls. As a result of these
    shortfalls, states are reducing Medicaid expenditures by
    implementing “freezes” or cuts in Medicaid rates paid
    to providers, including hospitals and skilled nursing
    facilities, or by restricting eligibility and benefits.

In the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Pub. L. No. 109 171),
    Congress made changes to the Medicaid program that were
    estimated to result in $10 billion in savings to the
    federal government over the five years following enactment of
    the legislation, primarily through the accounting practices some
    states use to calculate their matched payments and revising the
    qualifications for individuals who are eligible for Medicaid
    benefits. The changes made by CMS’s final rule updating SNF
    PPS for the 2006 federal fiscal year were also anticipated to
    reduce Medicaid payments to skilled nursing facility operators.
    In addition, as part of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of
    2006 (Pub. L.

No. 109-432),

Congress reduced the ceiling on taxes that states may impose on
    healthcare providers and which would qualify for federal
    financial participation under Medicaid by 0.5%, from 6% to 5.5%.
    Nationally, it was anticipated that this reduction would have a
    negligible effect, impacting only those states with taxes in
    excess of 5.5%. The ceiling is scheduled to revert back to 6% on
    October 1, 2011. We have not ascertained the impact of this
    reduction on our skilled nursing facility operators.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L.

No. 111-5)

(the “Recovery Act”), which was signed into law on
    February 17, 2009, provides additional funding for health
    care improvement, expansion and research, as well as Medicaid
    relief to the states. The Recovery Act temporarily increased
    federal payments to state Medicaid programs by
    $86.6 billion through, among other things, a 6.2% increase
    in the federal share of Medicaid expenditures across the board,
    with additional funds available depending on a state’s
    federal medical assistance percentage and unemployment rate.
    Though the Medicaid federal assistance payments were originally
    expected to expire on December 31, 2010, the
    President’s fiscal year 2011 budget submitted to Congress
    in February 2010 proposed, and Congress approved in August 2010,
    a six-month extension of those payments through June 30,
    2011. The Recovery Act also requires states to promptly pay



nursing facilities under their Medicaid program, and precludes
    states, as a condition of receiving the additional funding, from
    heightening their Medicaid eligibility requirements.

As state reimbursement methodologies continue to evolve, at this
    time we expect significant Medicaid rate freezes or cuts or
    other program changes to be adopted by many states. In addition,
    the U.S. government may revoke, reduce or stop approving
    “provider taxes” that have the effect of increasing
    Medicaid payments to the states. We cannot predict the impact of
    such actions on our operators and we cannot assure you that
    payments under Medicaid are currently, or will be in the future,
    sufficient to fully reimburse our operators for the cost of
    providing skilled nursing services. Severe and widespread
    Medicaid rate cuts or freezes could have a material adverse
    effect on our skilled nursing facility operators, which, in
    turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Environmental
    Regulation

As a real property owner, we are subject to various federal,
    state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental,
    health and safety matters. These laws and regulations address,
    among other things, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, fuel
    oil management, wastewater discharges, air emissions,
    radioactive materials, medical wastes, and hazardous wastes, and
    in certain cases, the costs of complying with these laws and
    regulations and the penalties for non-compliance can be
    substantial. Although we do not generally operate or manage our
    properties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally
    liable for costs relating to the investigation and

clean-up

of
    any property from which there is or has been an actual or
    threatened release of a regulated material and any other
    affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused
    the release. These costs typically are not limited by law or
    regulation and could exceed the property’s value. In
    addition, we may be liable for certain other costs, such as
    governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural
    resources, as a result of any such actual or threatened release.
    See “Risk Factors — Risks Arising from Our
    Business — If any of our properties are found to be
    contaminated, or if we become involved in any environmental
    disputes, we could incur substantial liabilities and costs”
    included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Under the terms of our lease and management agreements, we
    generally have a right to indemnification by the current
    operators and managers of our properties for contamination
    caused by them. For example, the Kindred Master Leases provide
    that Kindred will indemnify us against any environmental claims
    (including penalties and

clean-up

costs) resulting from any condition arising in, on or under, or
    relating to, the leased properties at any time on or after the
    applicable lease commencement date and from any condition
    permitted to deteriorate on or after such date (including as a
    result of migration from adjacent properties not owned or
    operated by us or any of our affiliates other than Kindred and
    its direct affiliates). However, we cannot assure you that our
    operators and managers will have the financial capability or
    willingness to satisfy their respective indemnification
    obligations to us, and any such inability or unwillingness to do
    so may require us to satisfy the underlying environmental
    claims. See “Risk Factors — Risks Arising from
    Our Business — We depend on Kindred and Brookdale
    Senior Living for a significant portion of our revenues and
    operating income; Any inability or unwillingness by Kindred or
    Brookdale Senior Living to satisfy its obligations under its
    agreements with us could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    us” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In general, we have also agreed to indemnify our tenants against
    any environmental claims (including penalties and

clean-up

costs) resulting from any condition arising in, on or under, or
    relating to, the leased properties at any time before the
    applicable lease commencement date. With respect to our
    Sunrise-managed properties, we have agreed to indemnify Sunrise
    against any environmental claims (including penalties and

clean-up

costs) resulting from any condition on those properties, unless
    Sunrise caused or contributed to that condition.

We did not make any material capital expenditures in connection
    with environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances and
    regulations in 2010 and do not expect that we will have to make
    any such material capital expenditures during 2011.



CERTAIN
    U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

The following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal
    income tax considerations that you may deem relevant as a holder
    of our common stock. It is not tax advice, nor does it purport
    to address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that
    may be important to particular stockholders in light of their
    personal circumstances or to certain types of stockholders that
    may be subject to special rules, such as insurance companies,
    tax-exempt organizations (except to the extent discussed below
    under “— Treatment of Tax-Exempt
    Stockholders”), financial institutions, pass-through
    entities (or investors in such entities) or broker-dealers, and

non-U.S. persons

and foreign corporations (except to the extent discussed below
    under “— Special Tax Considerations for

Non-U.S. Stockholders”).

The statements in this section are based on the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
    U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative and judicial
    interpretations thereof. The laws governing the
    U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs and their
    stockholders are highly technical and complex, and this
    discussion is qualified in its entirety by the authorities
    listed above, as in effect on the date hereof. We cannot assure
    you that new laws, interpretations of law or court decisions,
    any of which may take effect retroactively, will not cause any
    statement herein to be inaccurate.

Federal
    Income Taxation of Ventas

We elected REIT status beginning with the year ended
    December 31, 1999. Beginning with the 1999 tax year, we
    believe that we have satisfied the requirements to qualify as a
    REIT, and we intend to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal
    income tax purposes. If we continue to qualify for taxation as a
    REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on
    net income that we currently distribute to stockholders. This
    treatment substantially eliminates the “double
    taxation” (i.e., taxation at both the corporate and
    stockholder levels) that generally results from investment in a
    corporation.

Notwithstanding such qualification, we will be subject to
    federal income tax on any undistributed taxable income,
    including undistributed net capital gains, at regular corporate
    rates. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax if we
    do not satisfy specific REIT distribution requirements. See
    “— Requirements for Qualification as a
    REIT — Annual Distribution Requirements.” Under
    certain circumstances, we may be subject to the
    “alternative minimum tax” on our undistributed items
    of tax preference. If we have net income from the sale or other
    disposition of “foreclosure property” (see below) held
    primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of
    business or certain other non-qualifying income from foreclosure
    property, we will be subject to tax at the highest corporate
    rate on that income. See “— Requirements for
    Qualification as a REIT — Asset Tests.” In
    addition, if we have net income from “prohibited
    transactions” (which are, in general, certain sales or
    other dispositions of property (other than foreclosure property)
    held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of
    business), that income will be subject to a 100% tax.

We may also be subject to “Built-in Gains Tax” on any
    appreciated asset that we own or acquire that was previously
    owned by a C corporation (i.e., a corporation generally subject
    to full corporate-level tax). If we dispose of any such asset
    and recognize gain on the disposition during the ten-year period
    immediately after the asset was owned by a C corporation (either
    prior to our REIT election, or through stock acquisition or
    merger), then we generally will be subject to regular corporate
    income tax on the gain equal to the lesser of the recognized
    gain at the time of disposition or the built-in gain in that
    asset as of the date it became a REIT asset. Effective
    January 1, 2009, our Kindred assets were no longer subject
    to Built-in Gains Tax. The 21 Brookdale assets we acquired in
    connection with our Provident acquisition will remain subject to
    Built-in Gains Tax until November 2014.

In addition, if we fail to satisfy either of the gross income
    tests for qualification as a REIT (as discussed below), but
    still maintain such qualification under the relief provisions of
    the Code, we will be subject to a 100% tax on the gross income
    attributable to the amount by which we failed the applicable
    test, multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our
    profitability. If we violate one or more of the REIT asset tests
    (as discussed below), we may avoid a loss of our REIT status if
    we qualify under certain relief provisions and, among other
    things, pay a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest
    corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the
    non-qualifying asset during a specified period. If we fail to
    satisfy any requirement for REIT



qualification, other than the gross income or assets tests
    mentioned above, but nonetheless maintain such qualification by
    meeting certain other requirements, we may be subject to a
    $50,000 penalty for each failure. Finally, we will incur a 100%
    excise tax on certain transactions with a taxable REIT
    subsidiary that are not conducted on an arm’s-length basis.

See “— Requirements for Qualification as a
    REIT” below for other circumstances in which we may be
    required to pay federal taxes.

Requirements
    for Qualification as a REIT

To qualify as a REIT, we must meet the requirements discussed
    below relating to our organization, sources of income, nature of
    assets and distributions of income to stockholders.

Organizational
    Requirements

The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association:
    (i) that is managed by one or more directors or trustees;
    (ii) the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by
    transferable shares or by transferable certificates of
    beneficial interest; (iii) that would be taxable as a
    domestic corporation but for Sections 856 through 859 of
    the Code; (iv) that is neither a financial institution nor
    an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the Code;
    (v) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or
    more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of
    twelve months, or during a proportionate part of a shorter
    taxable year (the “100 Shareholder Rule”);
    (vi) not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of
    which is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer
    individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities)
    during the last half of each taxable year (the “5/50
    Rule”); (vii) that makes an election to be a REIT (or
    has made such election for a previous taxable year) and
    satisfies all relevant filing and other administrative
    requirements established by the Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”) that must be met in order to elect and to
    maintain REIT status; (viii) that uses a calendar year for
    federal income tax purposes; and (ix) that meets certain
    other tests, described below, regarding the nature of its income
    and assets.

We believe but cannot assure you that we have satisfied and will
    continue to satisfy the organizational requirements for
    qualification as a REIT. Our certificate of incorporation
    contains certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that
    are intended to prevent a concentration of ownership of our
    stock that would cause us to fail the


/


Rule or the 100 Shareholder Rule; however, we cannot assure
    you that these restrictions will actually prevent such
    concentration or our failure to qualify as a REIT.

In addition, to qualify as a REIT, a corporation may not have
    (as of the end of the taxable year) any earnings and profits
    that were accumulated in periods before it elected REIT status.
    We believe that we have not had any accumulated earnings and
    profits that are attributable to non-REIT periods, although the
    IRS is entitled to challenge that determination.

Gross
    Income Tests

We must satisfy two annual gross income requirements to qualify
    as a REIT:

•

At least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from
    prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must consist of
    defined types of income derived directly or indirectly from
    investments relating to real property or mortgages on real
    property (including pledges of equity interest in certain
    entities holding real property and also including “rents
    from real property” (as defined in the Code)) and, in
    certain circumstances, interest on certain types of temporary
    investment income; and

•

At least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from
    prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must be derived
    from such real property or temporary investments, dividends,
    interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or
    securities, or from any combination of the foregoing.

We believe but cannot assure you that we have been and will
    continue to be in compliance with the gross income tests
    described above. If we fail to satisfy one or both gross income
    tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a
    REIT for that year if we qualify under certain relief provisions
    of the Code, in which



case we would be subject to a 100% tax on the income exceeding
    one or both of the gross income tests. If we fail to satisfy one
    or both of the gross income tests and do not qualify under the
    relief provisions for any taxable year, we will not qualify as a
    REIT for that year, which would have a Material Adverse Effect
    on us.

Asset
    Tests

At the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must
    satisfy the following tests relating to the nature of our assets:

•

At least 75% of the value of our total assets must be
    represented by cash or cash items (including certain
    receivables), government securities, “real estate
    assets” (including interest in real property and in
    mortgages on real property and shares in other qualifying REITs)
    or, in cases where we raise new capital through stock or
    long-term (maturity of at least five years) debt offerings,
    temporary investments in stock or debt instruments during the
    one-year period following our receipt of such capital (the
    “75% asset test”); and

•

Of the investments not meeting the requirements of the 75% asset
    test, the value of any one issuer’s debt and equity
    securities owned by us (other than our interest in any entity
    classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, the
    stock of a taxable REIT subsidiary or the stock of a qualified
    REIT subsidiary) may not exceed 5% of the value of our total
    assets (the “5% asset test”), and we may not own more
    than 10% of any one issuer’s outstanding voting securities
    (the “10% voting securities test”) or 10% of the value
    of any one issuer’s outstanding securities, subject to
    limited “safe harbor” exceptions (the “10% value
    test”).

In addition, no more than 25% of the value of our assets can be
    represented by securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries (the
    “25% TRS test”).

We believe but cannot assure you that we have been and will
    continue to be in compliance with the asset tests described
    above. If we fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of our
    second, third or fourth calendar quarter, we may nevertheless
    continue to qualify as a REIT if we satisfied all of the asset
    tests at the close of the preceding calendar quarter and the
    discrepancy between the value of our assets and the asset test
    requirements is due to changes in the market values of our
    assets and not in any part caused by an acquisition of
    non-qualifying assets.

Furthermore, if we fail to satisfy any of the asset tests at the
    end of any calendar quarter without curing such failure within
    30 days after the end of such quarter, we would fail to
    qualify as a REIT unless we qualified under certain relief
    provisions enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of
    2004. Under one relief provision, we would continue to qualify
    as a REIT if our failure to satisfy the 5% asset test, the 10%
    voting securities test or the 10% value test is due to the
    ownership of assets having a total value not exceeding the
    lesser of 1% of our assets at the end of the relevant quarter or
    $10 million and we disposed of such assets (or otherwise
    met such asset tests) within six months after the end of the
    quarter in which the failure was identified. If we fail to
    satisfy any of the asset tests for a particular quarter but do
    not qualify under the relief provision described in the
    preceding sentence, then we would be deemed to have satisfied
    the relevant asset test if: (i) following identification of
    the failure, we filed a schedule with a description of each
    asset that caused the failure; (ii) the failure is due to
    reasonable cause and not willful neglect; (iii) we disposed
    of the non-qualifying asset (or otherwise met the relevant asset
    test) within six months after the end of the quarter in which
    the failure was identified; and (iv) we paid a penalty tax
    equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax
    rate multiplied by the net income generated by the
    non-qualifying asset during the period beginning on the first
    date of the failure and ending on the date we disposed of the
    asset (or otherwise cured the asset test failure). We cannot
    predict, however, whether in all circumstances we would be
    entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. If we fail
    to satisfy any of the asset tests and do not qualify for the
    relief provisions, we will lose our REIT status, which would
    have a Material Adverse Effect on us.



Foreclosure
    Property

The foreclosure property rules permit us (by our election) to
    foreclose or repossess properties without being disqualified as
    a REIT as a result of receiving income that does not qualify
    under the gross income tests. However, in that case, we would be
    subject to a corporate tax on the net non-qualifying income from
    “foreclosure property,” and the after-tax amount would
    increase the dividends we would be required to distribute to
    stockholders. See “— Annual Distribution
    Requirements” below.

Foreclosure property treatment will end on the first day on
    which we enter into a lease of the applicable property that will
    give rise to income that does not constitute “good
    REIT” income under Section 856(c)(3) of the Code. In
    addition, foreclosure property treatment will end if any
    construction takes place on the property (other than completion
    of a building or other improvement more than 10% complete before
    default became imminent). Foreclosure property treatment (other
    than for qualified healthcare property) is available for an
    initial period of three years and may, in certain circumstances,
    be extended for an additional three years. Foreclosure property
    treatment for qualified healthcare property is available for an
    initial period of two years and may, in certain circumstances,
    be extended for an additional four years.

Taxable
    REIT Subsidiaries

A taxable REIT subsidiary, or “TRS,” is a corporation
    subject to tax as a regular C corporation. Generally, a TRS can
    own assets that cannot be owned by a REIT and can perform tenant
    services (excluding the direct or indirect operation or
    management of a lodging or healthcare facility) that would
    otherwise disqualify the REIT’s rental income under the
    gross income tests. We are permitted to own up to 100% of a TRS,
    subject to the 25% TRS test, but there are certain limits on the
    ability of a TRS to deduct interest payments made to us. In
    addition, we are subject to a 100% penalty tax on any excess
    payments that we receive or any excess expenses deducted by the
    TRS if the economic arrangements between the REIT, the
    REIT’s tenants and the TRS are not comparable to similar
    arrangements among unrelated parties.

Annual
    Distribution Requirements

In order to be taxed as a REIT, we are required to distribute
    dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to our
    stockholders in an amount at least equal to the sum of
    (i) 90% of our “REIT taxable income” (computed
    without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net
    capital gain) and (ii) 90% of the net income (after tax),
    if any, from foreclosure property, minus the sum of certain
    items of non-cash income. These dividends must be paid in the
    taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable
    year if (i) they are declared in October, November or
    December, payable to stockholders of record on a specified date
    in any one of those months and actually paid during January of
    such following year or (ii) they are declared before we
    timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before
    the first regular dividend payment after such declaration, and
    we elect on our federal income tax return for the prior year to
    have a specified amount of the subsequent dividend as treated as
    paid in the prior year. To the extent we do not distribute all
    of our net capital gain or at least 90%, but less than 100%, of
    our “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be
    subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular capital
    gains and ordinary corporate tax rates except to the extent of
    our net operating loss or capital loss carryforwards. If we pay
    any Built-in Gains Taxes, those taxes will be deductible in
    computing REIT taxable income. Moreover, if we fail to
    distribute during each calendar year (or, in the case of
    distributions with declaration and record dates falling in the
    last three months of the calendar year, by the end of January
    following such calendar year) at least the sum of 85% of our
    REIT ordinary income for such year, 95% of our REIT capital gain
    net income for such year (other than long-term capital gain we
    elect to retain and treat as having been distributed to
    stockholders), and any undistributed taxable income from prior
    periods, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on
    the excess of such required distribution over the amounts
    actually distributed.

We believe but cannot assure you that we have satisfied the
    annual distribution requirements for the year of our initial
    REIT election and each year thereafter through the year ended
    December 31, 2010. Although we intend to satisfy the annual
    distribution requirements to continue to qualify as a REIT for
    the year ending



December 31, 2011 and subsequent years, economic, market,
    legal, tax or other considerations could limit our ability to
    meet those requirements.

In Revenue Procedure

2010-12,

the
    IRS stated that it would treat stock dividends as distributions
    for purposes of satisfying the REIT distribution requirements
    for calendar years 2008 through 2012, provided that stockholders
    can elect to receive the distribution in either cash or stock,
    subject to certain limitations. Any stock so distributed would
    be taxable to the recipient. We may choose to declare stock
    dividends in accordance with Revenue Procedure

2010-12

or
    otherwise. We also have net operating loss carryforwards that we
    can use to reduce our annual distribution requirements. See
    “Note 12 — Income Taxes” of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Failure
    to Continue to Qualify

If we fail to satisfy one or more requirements for REIT
    qualification, other than by violating a gross income or asset
    test for which relief is otherwise available as described above,
    we would retain our REIT qualification if the failure is due to
    reasonable cause and not willful neglect and if we pay a penalty
    of $50,000 for each such failure. We cannot predict, however,
    whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit
    of this relief provision.

If our election to be taxed as a REIT is revoked or terminated
    (e.g., due to a failure to meet the REIT qualification tests
    without qualifying for any applicable relief provisions), we
    would be subject to tax (including any applicable alternative
    minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates
    (for all open tax years beginning with the year our REIT
    election is revoked or terminated), except to the extent of our
    net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, and
    distributions to stockholders would not be deductible by us, nor
    would they be required to be made. To the extent of current and
    accumulated earnings and profits, all distributions to
    stockholders would be taxable as ordinary income, and, subject
    to certain limitations in the Code, corporate stockholders may
    be eligible for the dividends received deduction. In addition,
    we would be prohibited from re-electing REIT status for the four
    taxable years following the year during which we ceased to
    qualify as a REIT, unless certain relief provisions of the Code
    applied. We cannot predict, however, whether we would be
    entitled to such relief.

Federal
    Income Taxation of U.S. Stockholders

As used herein, the term “U.S. Stockholder”
    refers to any beneficial owner of our common stock that is, for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual who is a
    citizen or resident of the United States, a corporation created
    or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any
    state thereof or the District of Columbia, an estate the income
    of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal
    income tax purposes regardless of its source, or a trust if
    (i) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary
    supervision over the administration of such trust or
    (ii) the trust has elected under applicable
    U.S. Treasury Regulations to retain its pre-August 20,
    1996 classification as a U.S. person. If an entity treated
    as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds
    our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the
    partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner
    and the activities of the partnership. Partners of partnerships
    holding our stock should consult their tax advisors. This
    section assumes the U.S. Stockholder holds our common stock
    as a capital asset.

As long as we qualify as a REIT, distributions made to our
    taxable U.S. Stockholders out of current or accumulated
    earnings and profits (and not designated as capital gain
    dividends) generally will be taxable to such
    U.S. Stockholders as ordinary income and will not be
    eligible for the qualified dividends rate generally available to
    non-corporate holders or for the dividends received deduction
    generally available to corporations. Distributions that are
    designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as a capital
    gain (to the extent such distributions do not exceed our actual
    net capital gain for the taxable year) without regard to the
    period for which the stockholder has held its shares.
    Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and
    profits will not be taxable to a U.S. Stockholder to the
    extent they do not exceed the adjusted basis of the
    stockholder’s shares (determined on a

share-by-share

basis), but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of those
    shares. To the extent that distributions in excess of current
    and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the



adjusted basis of a stockholder’s shares, such
    distributions will be included in income as capital gains. The
    tax rate applicable to such capital gains will depend on the
    stockholder’s holding period for the shares. Any
    distribution declared by us and payable to a stockholder of
    record on a specified date in October, November or December of
    any year will be treated as both paid by us and received by the
    stockholder on December 31 of that year, provided that we
    actually pay the distribution during January of the following
    calendar year.

We may elect to treat all or a part of our undistributed net
    capital gain as if it had been distributed to our stockholders
    (including for purposes of the 4% excise tax discussed above
    under “— Requirements for Qualification as a
    REIT — Annual Distribution Requirements”). If we
    make such an election, our stockholders would be required to
    include in their income as long-term capital gain their
    proportionate share of our undistributed net capital gain, as
    designated by us. Each such stockholder would be deemed to have
    paid its proportionate share of the income tax imposed on us
    with respect to such undistributed net capital gain, and this
    amount would be credited or refunded to the stockholder. In
    addition, the tax basis of the stockholder’s shares would
    be increased by its proportionate share of undistributed net
    capital gains included in its income, less its proportionate
    share of the income tax imposed on us with respect to such gains.

Stockholders may not include in their individual income tax
    returns any of our net operating losses or net capital losses.
    Instead, we would carry over those losses for potential offset
    against our future income, subject to certain limitations.
    Taxable distributions from us and gain from the disposition of
    our common stock will not be treated as passive activity income,
    and, therefore, stockholders generally will not be able to apply
    any “passive activity losses” (such as losses from
    certain types of limited partnerships in which the stockholder
    is a limited partner) against such income. In addition, taxable
    distributions from us generally will be treated as investment
    income for purposes of the investment interest limitations.

We will notify stockholders after the close of our taxable year
    as to the portions of the distributions attributable to that
    year that constitute ordinary income, return of capital and
    capital gain. To the extent a portion of the distribution is
    designated as a capital gain dividend, we will notify
    stockholders as to the portion that is a “15% rate gain
    distribution” and the portion that is an unrecaptured
    Section 1250 distribution. A 15% rate gain distribution is
    a capital gain distribution to domestic stockholders that are
    individuals, estates or trusts that is taxable at a maximum rate
    of 15%. An unrecaptured Section 1250 gain distribution
    would be taxable to taxable domestic stockholders that are
    individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25%.

Taxation
    of U.S. Stockholders on the Disposition of Shares of Common
    Stock

In general, a U.S. Stockholder who is not a dealer in
    securities must treat any gain or loss realized upon a taxable
    disposition of our common stock as long-term capital gain or
    loss if the stockholder has held the shares for more than one
    year, and otherwise as short-term capital gain or loss. However,
    a U.S. Stockholder must treat any loss upon a sale or
    exchange of shares of our common stock held for six months or
    less as a long-term capital loss to the extent of capital gain
    dividends and any other actual or deemed distributions from us
    which the stockholder treats as long-term capital gain. All or a
    portion of any loss that a U.S. Stockholder realizes upon a
    taxable disposition of our common stock may be disallowed if the
    stockholder purchases other shares of our common stock within
    30 days before or after the disposition.

Treatment
    of Tax-Exempt Stockholders

Tax-exempt organizations, including qualified employee pension
    and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts
    (collectively, “Exempt Organizations”), generally are
    exempt from U.S. federal income taxation. However, they are
    subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income
    (“UBTI”). While many investments in real estate
    generate UBTI, the IRS has issued a published ruling that
    dividend distributions by a REIT to an exempt employee pension
    trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares of the
    REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of
    the exempt employee pension trust. Based on that ruling, and
    subject to the exceptions discussed below, amounts distributed
    by us to Exempt Organizations generally should not constitute
    UBTI. However, if an Exempt Organization finances its
    acquisition of our common stock with debt, a portion of its
    income from us will constitute UBTI pursuant to the
    “debt-financed property” rules. Furthermore, social
    clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations,



supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group
    legal services plans that are exempt from taxation under
    paragraphs (7), (9), (17) and (20), respectively, of
    Section 501(c) of the Code are subject to different UBTI
    rules, which generally require them to characterize
    distributions from us as UBTI. In addition, in certain
    circumstances, a pension trust that owns more than 10% of our
    stock is required to treat a percentage of the dividends from us
    as UBTI.

Special
    Tax Considerations for

Non-U.S.

Stockholders

As used herein, the term

“Non-U.S. Stockholder”

refers to nonresident alien individuals, foreign corporations,
    foreign estates and foreign trusts, but does not include any
    foreign stockholder whose investment in our stock is
    “effectively connected” with the conduct of a trade or
    business in the United States. Such a foreign stockholder, in
    general, will be subject to U.S. federal income tax with
    respect to its investment in our stock in the same manner as a
    U.S. Stockholder (subject to applicable alternative minimum
    tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of
    nonresident alien individuals). In addition, a foreign
    corporation receiving income that is treated as effectively
    connected with a U.S. trade or business also may be subject
    to an additional 30% “branch profits tax,” unless an
    applicable tax treaty provides a lower rate or an exemption.
    Certain certification requirements must be satisfied in order
    for effectively connected income to be exempt from withholding.

Distributions to

Non-U.S. Stockholders

that are not attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us
    of U.S. real property interests and are not designated by
    us as capital gain dividends (or deemed distributions of
    retained capital gains) will be treated as dividends of ordinary
    income to the extent that they are made out of our current or
    accumulated earnings and profits. Such distributions ordinarily
    will be subject to a withholding tax equal to 30% of the gross
    amount of the distribution unless an applicable tax treaty
    reduces or eliminates that tax. Distributions in excess of our
    current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable
    to a

Non-U.S. Stockholder

to the extent that such distributions do not exceed the adjusted
    basis of the stockholder’s shares (determined on a

share-by-share

basis), but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of those
    shares. To the extent that distributions in excess of current
    and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis
    of a

Non-U.S. Stockholder’s

shares, such distributions will give rise to tax liability if
    the

Non-U.S. Stockholder

would otherwise be subject to tax on any gain from the sale or
    disposition of its shares, as described below.

We expect to withhold U.S. tax at the rate of 30% on the
    gross amount of any dividends, other than dividends treated as
    attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of U.S. real
    property interests and capital gain dividends, paid to a

Non-U.S. Stockholder,

unless (i) a lower treaty rate applies and the required IRS

Form W-8BEN

evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with us or
    the appropriate withholding agent or (ii) the

Non-U.S. Stockholder

files an IRS

Form W-8ECI

or a successor form with us or the appropriate withholding agent
    properly claiming that the distributions are effectively
    connected with the

Non-U.S. Stockholder’s

conduct of a U.S. trade or business.

For any year in which we qualify as a REIT, distributions to a

Non-U.S. Stockholder

that owns more than 5% of our common shares at any time during
    the one-year period ending on the date of distribution and that
    are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of
    U.S. real property interests will be taxed to the

Non-U.S. Stockholder

under the provisions of the Foreign Investment in Real Property
    Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”) as if such gain were
    effectively connected with a U.S. business. Accordingly, a

Non-U.S. Stockholder

that owns more than 5% of our common shares will be taxed at the
    normal capital gain rates applicable to a U.S. Stockholder
    (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special
    alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien
    individuals). Distributions subject to FIRPTA also may be
    subject to a 30% branch profits tax if the recipient is a
    foreign corporate stockholder not entitled to treaty relief or
    exemption. Under FIRPTA, we are required to withhold 35% (which
    is higher than the maximum rate on long-term capital gains of
    non-corporate persons) of any distribution to a

Non-U.S. Stockholder

that owns more than 5% of our common shares which is or could be
    designated as a capital gain dividend attributable to
    U.S. real property interests. Moreover, if we designate
    previously made distributions as capital gain dividends
    attributable to U.S. real property interests, subsequent
    distributions (up to the amount of such prior distributions)
    will be treated as capital gain dividends subject to FIRPTA
    withholding. This amount is creditable against the

Non-U.S. Stockholder’s

FIRPTA tax liability. Capital gain dividends not attributable to



gain on the sale or exchange of U.S. real property
    interests are not subject to U.S. taxation if there is no
    withholding requirement.

If a

Non-U.S. Stockholder

does not own more than 5% of our common shares at any time
    during the one-year period ending on the date of a distribution,
    the gain will not be considered to be effectively connected with
    a U.S. business, and the

Non-U.S. Stockholder

would not be required to file a U.S. federal income tax
    return by receiving such a distribution. In this case, the
    distribution will be treated as a REIT dividend to that

Non-U.S. Stockholder

and taxed as a REIT dividend that is not a capital gain
    distribution (and subject to possible withholding), as described
    above. In addition, the branch profits tax will not apply to the
    distribution. For so long as our common stock continues to be
    regularly traded on an established securities market, the sale
    of such stock by any

Non-U.S. Stockholder

who is not a Five Percent

Non-U.S. Stockholder

(as defined below) generally will not be subject to
    U.S. federal income tax (unless the

Non-U.S. Stockholder

is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the United
    States for more than 182 days during the taxable year of
    the sale and certain other conditions apply, in which case such
    gain will be subject to a 30% tax on a gross basis). A
    “Five Percent

Non-U.S. Stockholder”

is a

Non-U.S. Stockholder

who, at some time during the five-year period preceding such
    sale or disposition, beneficially owned (including under certain
    attribution rules) more than 5% of the total fair market value
    of our common stock (as outstanding from time to time).

In general, the sale or other taxable disposition of our common
    stock by a Five Percent

Non-U.S. Stockholder

also will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if we
    are a “domestically controlled REIT.” A REIT is a
    “domestically controlled REIT” if, at all times during
    the five-year period preceding the disposition in question, less
    than 50% in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly
    by

Non-U.S. Stockholders.

Although we believe that we currently qualify as a domestically
    controlled REIT, because our common stock is publicly traded, we
    cannot assure you that we currently qualify or will qualify as a
    domestically controlled REIT at any time in the future. If we do
    not constitute a domestically controlled REIT, a Five Percent

Non-U.S. Stockholder

will be taxed in the same manner as a U.S. Stockholder with
    respect to gain on the sale of our common stock (subject to
    applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative
    minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals).

Information
    Reporting Requirements and Backup Withholding Tax

Information returns may be filed with the IRS and backup
    withholding tax may be collected in connection with
    distributions paid or required to be treated as paid during each
    calendar year and payments of the proceeds of a sale or other
    disposition of our common stock. Under the backup withholding
    rules, a stockholder may be subject to backup withholding at the
    applicable rate (currently 28% and scheduled to increase to 31%
    in 2011) with respect to distributions paid and proceeds
    from a disposition of our common stock unless such holder is a
    corporation,

non-U.S. person

or comes within certain other exempt categories and, when
    required, demonstrates this fact or provides a taxpayer
    identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from
    backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable
    requirements of the backup withholding rules. A stockholder who
    does not provide us with its correct taxpayer identification
    number also may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the
    U.S. federal income tax liability of persons subject to
    backup withholding tax will be offset by the amount of tax
    withheld. If backup withholding tax results in an overpayment of
    U.S. federal income taxes, a refund or credit may be
    obtained from the IRS, provided the required information is
    furnished timely thereto.

As a general matter, backup withholding and information
    reporting will not apply to a payment of the proceeds of a sale
    of our common stock by or through a foreign office of a foreign
    broker. Information reporting (but not backup withholding) will
    apply, however, to a payment of the proceeds of a sale of our
    common stock by a foreign office of a broker that is a
    U.S. person, a foreign partnership that derives 50% or more
    of its gross income for certain periods from the conduct of a
    trade or business in the United States, or more than 50% of
    whose capital or profit interests are owned during certain
    periods by U.S. persons, or a “controlled foreign
    corporation” for U.S. tax purposes, unless the broker
    has documentary evidence in its records that the holder is a

Non-U.S. Stockholder

and certain other conditions are satisfied, or the stockholder



otherwise establishes an exemption. Payment to or through a
    U.S. office of a broker of the proceeds of a sale of our
    common stock is subject to both backup withholding and
    information reporting unless the stockholder certifies under
    penalties of perjury that the stockholder is a

Non-U.S. Stockholder

or otherwise establishes an exemption. A stockholder may obtain
    a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
    rules in excess of its U.S. federal income tax liability by
    timely filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS.

Other Tax
    Consequences

State
    and Local Taxes

We

and/or

our stockholders may be subject to taxation by various states
    and localities, including those in which we or a stockholder
    transact business, own property or reside. State and local tax
    treatment may differ from the federal income tax treatment
    described above. Consequently, stockholders should consult their
    own tax advisers regarding the effect of state and local tax
    laws, in addition to federal, foreign and other tax laws, in
    connection with an investment in our common stock.

Possible
    Legislative or Other Actions Affecting Tax
    Consequences

You should recognize that future legislative, judicial and
    administrative actions or decisions, which may be retroactive in
    effect, could adversely affect our federal income tax treatment
    or the tax consequences of an investment in shares of our common
    stock. The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation
    are constantly under review by persons involved in the
    legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury
    Department, resulting in statutory changes as well as
    promulgation of new, or revisions to existing, regulations and
    revised interpretations of established concepts.

We cannot predict the likelihood of passage of any new tax
    legislation or other provisions either directly or indirectly
    affecting us or our stockholders or the value of an investment
    in our common stock.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors

This section discusses the most significant factors that affect
    our business, operations and financial condition. It does not
    describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our
    industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the following
    risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet
    identified or that we currently think are not material, actually
    occur, we could be materially adversely affected. In that event,
    the value of our securities could decline.

We have grouped these risk factors into three general categories:

•

Risks arising from our business;

•

Risks arising from our capital structure; and

•

Risks arising from our status as a REIT.

Risks
    Arising from Our Business

We
    depend on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living for a significant
    portion of our revenues and operating income; Any inability or
    unwillingness by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to satisfy
    its obligations under its agreements with us could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on us.

We lease a substantial portion of our properties to Kindred and
    Brookdale Senior Living, and each of them is a significant
    source of our total revenues and operating income. Since the
    Kindred Master Leases and our leases with Brookdale Senior
    Living are

triple-net

leases, we depend on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living not
    only for rental income, but also to pay insurance, taxes,
    utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with
    the leased properties. Any inability or unwillingness by Kindred
    or Brookdale Senior Living to make rental payments to us or to
    otherwise satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us
    could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. In addition, any
    failure by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to effectively
    conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties
    could adversely affect its



business reputation and its ability to attract and retain
    patients and residents in our properties, which could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on us. Kindred and Brookdale Senior
    Living have also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us
    harmless from and against various claims, litigation and
    liabilities arising in connection with their respective
    businesses, and we cannot assure you that either Kindred or
    Brookdale Senior Living will have sufficient assets, income,
    access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to
    satisfy its indemnification obligations.

The
    properties managed by Sunrise account for a significant portion
    of our revenues and operating income; Adverse developments in
    Sunrise’s business and affairs or financial condition could
    have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Sunrise currently manages 79 of our seniors housing communities
    pursuant to long-term management agreements. These properties
    represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their
    gross book value, and account for a significant portion of our
    total revenues and operating income. Although we have various
    rights as owner under the Sunrise management agreements, we rely
    on Sunrise’s personnel, good faith, expertise, historical
    performance, technical resources and information systems,
    proprietary information and judgment to manage our properties
    efficiently and effectively. We also rely on Sunrise to set
    resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial
    results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise
    operate those properties in accordance with the terms of our
    management agreements and in compliance with all applicable laws
    and regulations. For example, we depend on Sunrise’s
    ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who
    are responsible for the

day-to-day

operations of our seniors housing communities. A shortage of
    nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary
    pressures may force Sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits
    package to compete effectively for such personnel, and Sunrise
    may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the
    rates charged to residents. Any increase in labor costs and
    other property operating expenses, any failure by Sunrise to
    attract and retain qualified personnel, or changes in
    Sunrise’s senior management could adversely affect the
    income we receive from our Sunrise-managed communities and have
    a Material Adverse Effect on us.

In addition, any adverse developments in Sunrise’s business
    and affairs, financial strength or ability to operate our
    properties efficiently and effectively could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on us. If Sunrise experiences any significant
    financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties due to
    the weakened economy or otherwise, such difficulties could
    result in, among other adverse events, acceleration of its
    indebtedness, the inability to renew or extend its revolving
    credit facility, the enforcement of default remedies by its
    counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings
    under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code by or against Sunrise, any
    one or a combination of which could have a Material Adverse
    Effect on us.

We
    face potential adverse consequences of bankruptcy or insolvency
    by our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other
    obligors.

We are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators,
    borrowers, managers or other obligors could become bankrupt or
    insolvent. Although our lease, loan and management agreements
    provide us with the right to exercise certain remedies in the
    event of default on the obligations owing to us or upon the
    occurrence of certain insolvency events, the bankruptcy and
    insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed
    for bankruptcy or reorganization. For example, a debtor-lessee
    may reject its lease with us in a bankruptcy proceeding. In such
    a case, our claim against the debtor-lessee for unpaid and
    future rents would be limited by the statutory cap of the
    U.S. Bankruptcy Code. This statutory cap might be
    substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under
    the lease, and it is quite likely that any claim we might have
    for unpaid rent would not be paid in full. In addition, a
    debtor-lessee may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that its
    lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement. If
    such a claim is successful, our rights and remedies as a lender,
    compared to a landlord, would generally be more limited.
    Similarly, if a debtor-manager seeks bankruptcy protection, the
    automatic stay provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would
    preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager
    unless relief is first obtained from the court having
    jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. In the event of an
    obligor bankruptcy, we may also be required to fund certain
    expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs
    and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of



our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on a property

and/or

transition a property to a new tenant, operator or manager.

We may
    be unable to reposition our properties on as favorable terms, or
    at all, if we have to replace any of our tenants or operators,
    and we may be subject to delays, limitations and expenses in
    repositioning our assets.

We cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases
    upon their expiration. If the Kindred Master Leases, our leases
    with Brookdale Senior Living or any of our other leases are not
    renewed, we would be required to reposition those properties
    with another tenant or operator. In case of non-renewal, we
    generally have one year prior to expiration of the lease term to
    arrange for such repositioning and our tenants are required to
    continue to perform all of their obligations (including the
    payment of all rental amounts) for the non-renewed assets until
    such expiration. However, following expiration of the lease term
    or in the event we exercise our right to replace a tenant upon a
    lease default, during any period that we are attempting to
    locate a suitable replacement tenant or operator, there could be
    a decrease or cessation of rental payments on those properties.
    We also might not be successful in identifying suitable
    replacements or entering into leases with new tenants or
    operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as
    our current leases, if at all, and we may be required to fund
    certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt
    costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value and avoid
    the imposition of liens on properties while they are being
    repositioned.

Our ability to reposition our properties with another suitable
    tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by
    various state licensing receivership, CON or other laws, as well
    as by the Medicare and Medicaid

change-of-ownership

rules. We could also incur substantial additional expenses in
    connection with any licensing, receivership or

change-of-ownership

proceedings. In the case of our MOBs, our ability to locate
    suitable replacement tenants could be impaired by the
    specialized medical uses of those properties, and we may be
    required to spend substantial amounts to adapt the MOB to other
    uses. Any such delays, limitations and expenses could adversely
    impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased
    properties or otherwise exercise remedies for tenant default and
    could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

We
    have now, and may have in the future, exposure to contingent
    rent escalators, which can hinder our growth and
    profitability.

We receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing our
    assets under long-term

triple-net

leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual
    escalations. Certain of our leases contain escalators contingent
    upon the achievement of specified revenue parameters or based on
    changes in the Consumer Price Index. If the revenues generated
    by our

triple-net

leased properties as a result of weak economic conditions or
    other factors or the Consumer Price Index does not increase, our
    revenues attributes to these leases may not increase.

The
    weakened economy could adversely impact our operating income and
    earnings, as well as the results of operations of our tenants
    and operators, which could impair their ability to meet their
    obligations to us.

Continued concerns about the U.S. economy and the systemic
    impact of high unemployment, volatile energy costs, geopolitical
    issues, the availability and cost of credit, the
    U.S. mortgage market and a severely distressed real estate
    market have contributed to increased market volatility and
    weakened business and consumer confidence. This difficult
    operating environment could adversely affect our ability to
    generate revenues

and/or

increase our costs at our Sunrise-managed properties, thereby
    reducing our operating income and earnings. It could also have
    an adverse impact on the ability of our tenants and operators to
    maintain occupancy and rates in our properties, which could harm
    their financial condition. These economic conditions could cause
    us to experience operating deficiencies at our Sunrise-managed
    properties

and/or

cause
    our tenants and operators to be unable to meet their rental
    payments and other obligations due to us, which could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on us.



We may
    be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing
    our real estate loan investments, and even if we are successful
    in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully
    reposition the properties, which may adversely affect our
    ability to recover our investments.

If a borrower defaults under any of our mortgage loans, we may
    have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by
    acquiring title to the property and thereafter making
    substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the
    property’s investment potential. The borrower may contest
    enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies, seek bankruptcy
    protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies

and/or

bring
    claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce
    mortgage obligations. If the borrower seeks bankruptcy
    protection, the automatic stay provisions of the
    U.S. Bankruptcy Code would preclude us from enforcing
    foreclosure or other remedies against the borrower unless relief
    is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the
    bankruptcy case. Foreclosure-related costs, high

loan-to-value

ratios or declines in the value of the property may prevent us
    from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage loans upon
    foreclosure, and we may be required to record valuation
    allowance for such losses. Even if we are able to successfully
    foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate loan
    investments, we may inherit properties that we are unable to
    expeditiously reposition with new tenants or operators, if at
    all, which would adversely affect our ability to recover our
    investment.

We are
    exposed to various operational risks, liabilities and claims
    with respect to our operating assets that may adversely affect
    our ability to generate revenues and/or increase our costs and
    could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

We are exposed to various operational risks, liabilities and
    claims with respect to our operating assets, including our
    Sunrise-managed properties and our MOBs, that may adversely
    affect our ability to generate revenues

and/or

increase our costs, thereby reducing our profitability. These
    risks include fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to
    achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases
    in those fees), rent control regulations, increases in costs of
    materials, energy, labor (as a result of unionization or
    otherwise) and services, national and regional economic
    conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital
    expenditure requirements, professional and general liability
    claims and the availability and costs of professional and
    general liability insurance. Any one or a combination of these
    factors could result in operating deficiencies at our operating
    assets which could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

We may
    encounter certain risks when implementing our business strategy
    to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of,
    additional seniors housing and/or healthcare
    assets.

We intend to continue to pursue investments in,

and/or

acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing

and/or

healthcare assets domestically and internationally, subject to
    the contractual restrictions contained in our unsecured
    revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing our
    outstanding senior notes. Investments in and acquisitions of
    these properties, including our pending Atria acquisition,
    entail general risks associated with any real estate investment,
    including risks that the investment will fail to perform in
    accordance with expectations, that the estimates of the cost of
    improvements necessary for acquired properties will prove
    inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to
    meet performance expectations. Furthermore, healthcare
    properties are often highly customized and may require costly
    tenant-specific improvements.

In addition, any new development projects that we pursue would
    be subject to risks of construction delays or cost overruns that
    may increase project costs, new project commencement risks such
    as receipt of zoning, occupancy and other required governmental
    approvals and permits and the risk of incurring development
    costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to
    completion. Investments in and acquisitions of properties
    outside the United States would also expose us to legal,
    economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign
    countries, such as currency and tax risks. If we incur
    additional debt or issue equity securities, or both, to finance
    future investments, acquisitions or development activity (as we
    intend to do in our pending Atria acquisition), our leverage
    could increase or our per share financial results could be
    reduced.



When we attempt to finance, acquire or develop properties, we
    compete with healthcare providers, other healthcare REITs,
    healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance
    companies, private equity firms and other investors, some of
    whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of
    capital than we do. Our ability to compete successfully for
    investment and acquisition opportunities is affected by many
    factors, including our cost of obtaining debt and equity capital
    at rates comparable to or better than our competitors. Increased
    competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and
    successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business
    objectives and could improve the bargaining power of property
    owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding our investment,
    acquisition and development activities. See
    “Business — Competition” included in
    Item 1 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Even if we succeed in identifying and competing for such
    opportunities, we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and
    expenditures relating to the properties or businesses we invest
    in or acquire, the investment or acquisition could divert
    management’s attention from our existing business, or the
    value of such investment or acquisition could decrease
    substantially, some or all of which could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on us.

As we invest in,

and/or

acquire or develop, additional seniors housing

and/or

healthcare assets or businesses, we expect that the number of
    operators of our properties and, potentially, our business
    segments will increase. We cannot assure you that we will have
    the capabilities to successfully monitor and manage a portfolio
    of properties with a growing number of operators

and/or

manage such businesses. Moreover, in some cases, acquisitions
    require the integration of companies that have previously
    operated independently. Successful integration of the operations
    of those companies will depend primarily on our ability to
    consolidate operations, systems, procedures and personnel to
    eliminate redundancies and costs. Potential difficulties we
    could encounter during integration include the loss of key
    employees, disruption of our business, possible inconsistencies
    in standards, controls, procedures and policies, and the
    assumption of unexpected liabilities. In addition, projections
    of estimated future revenues, costs savings or operating metrics
    that we develop during the due diligence and integration
    planning process could prove to be inaccurate. If we experience
    any of these difficulties, or if we later discover additional
    liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to
    acquisitions, we might not achieve the economic benefit we
    expect, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Our
    investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare
    real estate, making us more vulnerable economically than if our
    investments were diversified.

We invest primarily in real estate — in particular,
    seniors housing and healthcare properties. This concentration
    exposes us to all of the risks inherent in investments in real
    estate to a greater degree than if our portfolio was
    diversified, and these risks are magnified by the fact that our
    real estate investments are limited to properties used in the
    seniors housing or healthcare industries. If the current
    downturn in the real estate industry continues or intensifies,
    it could adversely affect the value of our properties and our
    ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to
    us. A downturn in the seniors housing or healthcare industries
    could negatively impact our operating income and earnings, as
    well as our operators’ ability to make rental payments to
    us, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our
    ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in
    response to changes in economic or other conditions will be
    limited. In addition, transfers of healthcare properties may be
    subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for
    transfers of other types of commercial properties. We cannot
    give any assurances that we will recognize full value for any
    property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons.
    This inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance
    of our investments could adversely affect our business, results
    of operations and financial condition.

The healthcare industry is highly competitive. The occupancy
    levels at, and revenues from, our properties depend on the
    ability of our operators and managers to successfully compete
    with other operators and managers, including on the bases of
    scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and
    financial condition, physical appearance of the properties,
    price, and location. We cannot be certain that our operators and
    managers will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate
    levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to
    us. Moreover, our operators and managers may encounter increased
    competition in the future that could limit their ability to
    attract residents and patients or expand their businesses, which
    could



materially adversely affect their ability to meet their
    obligations to us and, in turn, could have a Material Adverse
    Effect on us.

Furthermore, the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and
    changes in government regulation and reimbursement in the past
    have had material adverse consequences on the industry in
    general, which consequences may not have been contemplated by
    lawmakers and regulators. We cannot assure you that future
    changes in government regulation of healthcare will not have a
    material adverse effect on the healthcare industry, including
    our seniors housing and healthcare operations, tenants and
    operators. Our ability to invest in non-seniors housing or
    non-healthcare properties is restricted by the terms of our
    unsecured revolving credit facilities, so these adverse effects
    may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments
    outside of real estate or outside of seniors housing or
    healthcare properties.

Our
    tenants, operators and managers may be adversely affected by
    increasing healthcare regulation and enforcement.

Over the last several years, the regulatory environment
    surrounding the long-term healthcare industry has intensified
    both in the amount and type of regulations and in the efforts to
    enforce those regulations. This is particularly true for large
    for-profit, multi-facility providers like Kindred, Brookdale
    Senior Living and Sunrise. The extensive federal, state and
    local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry
    include those relating to, among other things, licensure,
    conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of
    facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for
    services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient
    rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, and financial and other
    arrangements which may be entered into by healthcare providers.
    Changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments
    have resulted in a significant increase in the number of
    inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other
    regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the Medicare
    and Medicaid programs, bars on Medicare and Medicaid payments
    for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal
    penalties. See “Governmental Regulation —
    Healthcare Regulation” included in Item 1 of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

If our tenants, operators and managers fail to comply with the
    extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to
    their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could
    become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and
    private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of
    new patients or residents, suffer civil

and/or

criminal penalties

and/or

be
    required to make significant changes to their operations. Our
    tenants, operators and managers also could be forced to expend
    considerable resources responding to an investigation or other
    enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. In such
    event, the results of operations and financial condition of our
    tenants, operators and managers and the results of operations of
    our properties operated or managed by those entities could be
    adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on us. We are unable to predict the future course
    of federal, state and local regulation or legislation, including
    the Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations, or the
    intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulation
    and legislation, and any changes in the regulatory framework
    could likewise have a material adverse effect on our tenants,
    operators and managers, which, in turn, could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on us.

Changes
    in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from
    third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our
    tenants and operators.

Kindred and certain of our other tenants and operators rely on
    reimbursement from third-party payors, including the Medicare
    and Medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues.
    Various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals
    have been made that would implement cost-containment measures
    that limit payments to healthcare providers. Budget crises and
    financial shortfalls could also cause states to implement
    Medicaid rate freezes or cuts. See “Governmental
    Regulation — Healthcare Regulation” included in
    Item 1 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In addition, private third-party payors have continued their
    efforts to control healthcare costs. We cannot assure you that
    adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services to
    be provided by Kindred and our other tenants and operators that
    are currently being reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or private
    payors. Significant limits by governmental and private
    third-party payors on



the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and
    fees could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity,
    financial condition and results of operations of certain of our
    tenants and operators, which could affect adversely their
    ability to make rental payments under, and otherwise comply with
    the terms of, their leases with us.

We
    have only limited rights to terminate our management agreements
    with Sunrise, and we may be unable to replace Sunrise if our
    management agreements are terminated or not
    renewed.

We and Sunrise are parties to long-term management agreements
    pursuant to which Sunrise currently provides comprehensive
    property management services with respect to 79 of our seniors
    housing communities. Each management agreement has an original
    term of 30 years commencing as early as 2004, but may be
    terminated by us upon the occurrence of an event of default by
    Sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term
    thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of
    any licenses or certificates necessary for operation), subject
    in most cases to Sunrise’s rights to cure such defaults.
    Each management agreement may also be terminated upon the
    occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to Sunrise. In
    addition, we may terminate management agreements based on the
    failure to achieve certain NOI targets or to comply with certain
    expense control covenants. However, various legal and
    contractual considerations may limit or delay our exercise of
    any or all of these termination rights.

In the event that our management agreements with Sunrise are
    terminated for any reason or are not renewed upon expiration of
    their terms, we will have to find another manager for the
    properties covered by those agreements. We believe there are a
    number of qualified national and regional seniors care providers
    that would be interested in managing our Sunrise-managed
    properties. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able
    to locate another suitable manager or, if we are successful in
    locating such a manager, that it will manage the properties
    effectively. Moreover, any such replacement manager would
    require approval by the applicable regulatory authority and, in
    most cases, the mortgage lender of the applicable property. We
    cannot assure you that such approvals would be granted or that,
    if granted, the process of seeking such approvals would not
    cause delay. Any inability or lengthy delay in replacing Sunrise
    as manager following termination or non-renewal of our
    management agreements could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Our
    investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our
    lack of sole decision-making authority regarding major
    decisions, our reliance on our joint venture partners’
    financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and
    our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses
    from the actions of our joint venture partners.

As of December 31, 2010, we had controlling interests in
    six MOBs owned through joint ventures with partners who provide
    management and leasing services for the properties, and we had
    noncontrolling interests of between 5% and 20% in 58 MOBs owned
    through joint ventures with institutional third parties. These
    joint ventures involve risks not present with respect to our
    wholly owned properties, including the following:

•

We may be prevented from taking actions that are opposed by our
    joint venture partners. Under certain of our joint venture
    arrangements, we may share decision-making authority with our
    joint venture partners regarding major decisions affecting the
    ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property
    owned by the joint venture, such as the sale or financing of the
    property or the making of additional capital contributions for
    the benefit of the property. For joint ventures where we have a
    noncontrolling interest our joint venture partners may take
    actions that we oppose;

•

Our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a
    third party may be restricted. Prior consent of our joint
    venture partners may be required for a sale or transfer to a
    third party of our interests in such joint ventures;

•

Our joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund
    their share of required capital contributions, which may delay
    construction or development of a property or increase our
    financial commitment to the joint venture;



•

Our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals
    with respect to the property that conflict with our business
    interests and goals, which could increase the likelihood of
    disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of
    the property;

•

Disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over
    decisions affecting the property or the joint venture, which may
    result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our
    expenses, distract our officers

and/or

directors from focusing their time and effort on our business
    and disrupt the

day-to-day

operations of the property, such as by delaying the
    implementation of important decisions until the conflict or
    dispute is resolved; and

•

We may suffer losses as a result of the actions of our joint
    venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments.

We may
    be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates.

We currently own twelve seniors housing communities in the
    Canadian provinces of Ontario and British Columbia. As a result,
    we are subject to fluctuations in U.S. and Canadian
    exchange rates, which may, from time to time, have an impact on
    our financial condition and results of operations. Increases or
    decreases in the value of the Canadian dollar will impact the
    amount of our net income. In addition, if we increase our
    international presence through investments in,

and/or

acquisitions or development of, seniors housing

and/or

healthcare assets outside the United States, we may transact
    additional business in currencies other than U.S. or
    Canadian dollars. Although we may decide to pursue hedging
    alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to
    protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure
    you that any such fluctuations will not have a Material Adverse
    Effect on us.

Revenues
    from our senior living operations are dependent on private pay
    sources; Events which adversely affect the ability of seniors to
    afford our daily resident fees could cause our occupancy rates,
    resident fee revenues and results of operations to
    decline.

By and large, assisted and independent living services currently
    are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs,
    such as Medicare and Medicaid. Hence, substantially all of the
    resident fee revenues generated by our senior living operations
    are derived from private pay sources consisting of income or
    assets of residents or their family members. In general, due to
    the expense associated with building new properties and the
    staffing and other costs of providing services at these
    properties, only seniors with income or assets meeting or
    exceeding the comparable median in the regions where our
    properties are located typically can afford to pay the daily
    resident and care fees. The current economic downturn and
    depressed housing market, as well as other events such as
    changes in demographics, could adversely affect the ability of
    seniors to afford these fees. If Sunrise or another manager is
    unable to attract and retain seniors with sufficient income,
    assets or other resources required to pay the fees associated
    with assisted and independent living services, our occupancy
    rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations could
    decline, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    us.

Our
    ownership of certain properties subject to ground lease, air
    rights or other restrictive agreements exposes us to the loss of
    such properties upon breach or termination of such agreements,
    limits our uses of these properties and restricts our ability to
    sell or otherwise transfer such
    properties

.

We hold interests in certain of our MOB properties through
    leasehold interests in the land on which the buildings are
    located, through leases of air rights for the space above the
    land on which the buildings are located or through similar
    agreements, and we may acquire or develop additional properties
    in the future that are subject to similar ground lease, air
    rights or other restrictive agreements. Under these agreements,
    we are exposed to the possibility of losing our interests in the
    property upon termination or an earlier breach by us. In
    addition, many of our ground lease, air rights and other
    restrictive agreements impose significant limitations on our
    uses of the subject properties and restrict our right to convey
    our interest in such agreements, which may limit our ability to
    timely sell or exchange the properties and impair their value.



Overbuilding
    in markets in which our seniors housing communities and MOBs are
    located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates,
    operating margins and profitability.

Barriers to entry in the assisted living and MOB industries are
    not substantial. Consequently, the development of new seniors
    housing communities or MOBs could outpace demand. If the
    development of new seniors housing communities or MOBs outpaces
    demand for those asset types in the markets in which our
    properties are located, those markets may become saturated and
    we could experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating
    margins and lower profitability.

Termination
    of resident lease agreements could adversely affect our revenues
    and earnings.

Applicable regulations governing assisted living communities
    generally require written resident lease agreements with each
    resident. Most of these regulations also require that each
    resident have the right to terminate the resident lease
    agreement for any reason on reasonable notice. Consistent with
    these regulations, the resident lease agreements signed by
    Sunrise with respect to our properties managed by it generally
    allow residents to terminate their lease agreements on
    30 days’ notice. Thus, Sunrise cannot contract with
    residents to stay for longer periods of time, unlike typical
    apartment leasing arrangements with terms of up to one year or
    longer. In addition, the resident turnover rate in our seniors
    housing communities may be difficult to predict. If a large
    number of resident lease agreements terminate at or around the
    same time, and if our units remained unoccupied, then our
    revenues and earnings could be adversely affected, which, in
    turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Volatility
    or disruption in the capital markets could prevent our
    counterparties from satisfying their obligations to
    us.

Uncertainty in the capital markets and tightening of credit
    markets, similar to that experienced in recent years, could make
    accessing new capital more challenging and more expensive for
    our counterparties. Interest rate fluctuations, financial market
    volatility or credit market disruptions could limit the ability
    of our tenants, operators and managers to obtain credit to
    finance their businesses on acceptable terms, which could
    adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to
    us. In addition, any difficulty experienced by our other
    counterparties, such as letters of credit issuers, insurance
    carriers, banking institutions, title companies and escrow
    agents, in accessing capital or other sources of funds could
    prevent such counterparties from remaining viable entities

and/or

satisfying their obligations to us, which could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on us.

The
    amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies
    and policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers
    may not adequately insure against losses.

We maintain

and/or

require in our existing leases and other agreements that our
    tenants, operators and managers maintain all applicable lines of
    insurance on our properties and their operations. Although we
    continually review the insurance maintained by us and our
    tenants, operators and managers and believe the coverage
    provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our
    industry, we cannot assure you that in the future such insurance
    will be available at a reasonable cost or that we or our
    tenants, operators and managers will be able to maintain
    adequate levels of insurance coverage. We also cannot give any
    assurances as to the future financial viability of our insurers
    or that the insurance coverage provided will fully cover all
    losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic
    event.

Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits
    occur, we could incur substantial liability or lose all or a
    portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well
    as the anticipated future revenues from the property. In such an
    event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage
    debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We
    cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in
    excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future.

As part of our MOB development business, we provide engineering,
    construction and architectural services, and design,
    construction or systems failures may result in substantial
    injury or damage to clients

and/or

third
    parties. Injury or damage claims may arise in the ordinary
    course and may be asserted with respect to ongoing or completed
    projects. Although we maintain liability insurance, if any claim
    results in a



loss, we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage would be
    adequate to cover the loss in full. If we sustain losses in
    excess of our insurance coverage, we may be required to make a
    payment for the difference and could lose our investment in,
    and/or experience reduced profits and cash flows from, the
    affected MOB, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Significant
    legal actions could subject us or our tenants, operators and
    managers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured
    liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our or
    their liquidity, financial condition and results of
    operation.

From time to time, we may be directly involved in lawsuits and
    other legal proceedings. We may also be named as defendants in
    lawsuits arising out of alleged actions of our tenants,
    operators and managers for which such tenants, operators and
    managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless
    from and against certain claims and liabilities. An unfavorable
    resolution of pending or future litigation could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on us.

Our tenants, operators and managers continue to experience
    increases in both the frequency and severity of professional
    liability claims. In addition to large compensatory claims,
    plaintiffs’ attorneys continue to seek significant punitive
    damages and attorneys’ fees. Due to the historically high
    frequency and severity of professional liability claims against
    healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability
    insurance has been restricted and the premiums on such insurance
    coverage remain very high. As a result, the insurance coverage
    of our tenants, operators and managers might not cover all
    claims against them or continue to be available to them at a
    reasonable cost. If our tenants, operators and managers are
    unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required
    to pay punitive damages, they may be exposed to substantial
    liabilities.

In addition, many healthcare providers are pursuing different
    organizational and corporate structures coupled with
    self-insurance programs that provide less insurance coverage.
    For example, Kindred insures its professional liability risks,
    in part, through a wholly owned, limited purpose insurance
    company, which insures initial losses up to specified coverage
    levels per occurrence with no aggregate coverage limit. Coverage
    for losses in excess of those per occurrence levels is
    maintained through unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers up
    to an aggregate limit, and all claims in excess of the aggregate
    limit are then insured by the limited purpose insurance company.
    Similarly, Sunrise maintains a self-insurance program to cover
    its general and professional liabilities. Our tenants, operators
    and managers, like Kindred and Sunrise, that insure any part of
    their general and professional liability risks through their own
    captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future
    cost of general and professional liability through actuarial
    studies that rely primarily on historical data. However, due to
    the rise in the number and severity of professional claims
    against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may
    underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future
    claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those
    claims.

As a result, the tenants, operators and managers of our
    properties could incur large funded and unfunded professional
    liability expense, which could materially adversely affect their
    liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and,
    in turn, their ability to make rental payments under, or
    otherwise comply with the terms of, their leases with us or,
    with regard to our Sunrise-managed properties, our results of
    operations, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

The
    hospitals on whose campuses our MOBs are located and their
    affiliated health systems could fail to remain competitive or
    financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability
    to attract physicians and physician groups to our
    MOBs.

Our MOB operations depend on the viability of the hospitals on
    or near whose campuses our MOBs are located and their affiliated
    health systems in order to attract physicians and other
    healthcare-related clients. The viability of these hospitals, in
    turn, depends on factors such as the quality and mix of
    healthcare services provided, competition, demographic trends in
    the surrounding community, market position and growth potential,
    as well as the ability of the affiliated health systems to
    provide economies of scale and access to capital. If a hospital
    on or near whose campus one of our MOBs is located is unable to
    meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated health
    system is unable to support that hospital, the hospital may not
    be able to



compete successfully or it could be forced to close or relocate,
    which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians
    and other healthcare-related clients. Because we rely on our
    proximity to and affiliations with these hospitals to create
    demand for space in our MOBs, their inability to remain
    competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and
    physician groups, could materially adversely affect our MOB
    operations and have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

We may
    not be able to maintain or expand our relationships with our
    existing and future hospital and health system
    clients.

The success of our MOB business depends, to a large extent, on
    our past, current and future relationships with hospital and
    health system clients. We invest a significant amount of time to
    develop these relationships, and they have helped us to secure
    acquisition and development opportunities, as well as other
    advisory, property management and hospital project management
    projects, with both new and existing clients. If any of our
    relationships with hospital or health system clients
    deteriorates, or if a conflict of interest or non-compete
    arrangement prevents us from expanding these relationships, our
    ability to secure new acquisition and development opportunities
    or other advisory, property management and hospital project
    management projects could be adversely impacted and our
    professional reputation within the industry could be damaged.

Our
    MOB development projects, including development projects
    undertaken on a

fee-for-service

basis or through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated
    returns.

A key component of our MOB long-term growth strategy is
    exploring development opportunities and, when appropriate,
    making investments in those projects. In deciding whether to
    make an investment in a particular MOB development, we make
    certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of
    that property. These assumptions are subject to risks normally
    associated with these projects, including, among others:

•

we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on
    favorable terms or at all;

•

we may not complete development projects on schedule or within
    budgeted amounts;

•

we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary
    zoning, land use, building, occupancy, environmental and other
    required governmental permits and authorizations, or
    underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to
    market standards;

•

development and construction delays may give tenants the right
    to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur
    additional costs;

•

volatility in the price of construction materials and labor may
    increase our development costs;

•

hospitals or health systems may maintain significant
    decision-making authority with respect to the development
    schedule;

•

one of our builders may fail to perform or satisfy the
    expectations of our clients or prospective clients;

•

we may incorrectly forecast risks associated with development in
    new geographic regions;

•

tenants may not lease space at the quantity or rental rate
    levels projected;

•

competition from other developments may lure away desirable
    tenants;

•

the demand for the development project may decrease prior to
    completion; and

•

lease rates and rents at newly developed properties may
    fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and
    economic conditions.

Moreover, in MOB development projects undertaken on a

fee-for-service

basis, we generally construct properties for clients in exchange
    for a fixed fee, which creates risks such as the inability to
    pass on increased labor and construction material costs to our
    clients, development and construction delays that could give our
    counterparties the right to receive penalties from us, and
    bankruptcy or default by our contractors. We attempt



to mitigate these risks by establishing certain limits on our
    obligations, shifting some of the risk to the general contractor

and/or

seeking other legal protections.

If any of the foregoing risks occur, our MOB development
    projects, including development projects undertaken on a

fee-for-service

basis or through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated
    returns, which could materially adversely affect our MOB
    operations and have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Our
    operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower
    statute.

Our operators who engage in business with the federal government
    may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to
    combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. See
    “Governmental Regulation — Healthcare
    Regulation” included in Item 1 of this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

These lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and
    award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring
    these suits. If any of these lawsuits were to be brought against
    our operators, such suits combined with increased operating
    costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a
    material adverse effect on the operators’ liquidity,
    financial condition and results of operation and on their
    ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could
    have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

If any
    of our properties are found to be contaminated, or if we become
    involved in any environmental disputes, we could incur
    substantial liabilities and costs.

Under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a
    current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs
    related to the investigation, removal and remediation of
    hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released
    from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in
    connection with such property. Owners of real property may also
    face other environmental liabilities, including government fines
    and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for
    injuries to persons, property or natural resources.
    Environmental laws and regulations often impose liability
    without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was
    responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous
    or toxic substances or petroleum. In certain circumstances,
    environmental liability may result from the activities of a
    current or former operator of the property. Although we are
    generally indemnified by the current operators of our properties
    for contamination caused by them, these indemnities may not
    adequately cover all environmental costs. See “Governmental
    Regulation — Environmental Regulation” included
    in Item 1 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Our
    success depends, in part, on our ability to retain key
    personnel, and the loss of any one of them could adversely
    impact our business.

The success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership
    and performance of our executive management team and key
    employees. Our future performance will be substantially
    dependent on our ability to retain and motivate these
    individuals. Competition for these individuals is intense, and
    we cannot give any assurances that we will retain our key
    officers and employees or that we can attract or retain other
    highly qualified individuals in the future. Losing any one or
    more of these persons could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Failure
    to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting
    could harm our business, results of operations and financial
    condition.

Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to
    provide a report by management on internal control over
    financial reporting, including management’s assessment of
    the effectiveness of such control. Changes to our business will
    necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and
    processes. Internal control over financial reporting may not
    prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent
    limitations, including the possibility of human error, the
    circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore,
    even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable
    assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation
    of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of
    our internal controls, including any failure to implement
    required new or improved controls, or if we experience
    difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of
    operations and financial condition could be materially adversely
    harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations.



If the
    liabilities we have assumed in connection with acquisitions are
    greater than expected, or if there are unknown liabilities, our
    business could be materially and adversely
    affected.

We have assumed certain liabilities in connection with our past
    acquisitions, such as the Lillibridge acquisition, including, in
    some cases, contingent liabilities, and we expect to assume
    certain liabilities in connection with the Atria acquisition, if
    consummated. As we integrate these acquisitions, we may learn
    additional information about the seller and assumed liabilities
    that adversely affects us, such as:

•

Liabilities relating to the

clean-up

or
    remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions;

•

Unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the
    seller;

•

Liabilities, claims and litigation, whether or not incurred in
    the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to
    our acquisition;

•

Claims for indemnification by general partners, directors,
    officers and others indemnified by the seller; and

•

Liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our
    acquisition.

As a result, we cannot assure you that our past acquisitions
    will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business.
    Among other things, if the liabilities we have assumed are
    greater than expected, or if there are obligations relating to
    the acquired properties of which we were not aware at the time
    we completed the acquisition, our business could be materially
    adversely affected.

Risks
    Arising from Our Capital Structure

Limitations
    on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on
    our ability to meet our debt payments, make distributions to our
    stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement
    our business plan.

In order to meet our debt payments, make distributions to our
    stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement
    our business plan, we may need to raise additional capital. In
    recent years, the global capital and credit markets have
    experienced a period of extraordinary turmoil and upheaval,
    characterized by the bankruptcy, failure or sale of various
    financial institutions and an unprecedented level of
    intervention from the U.S. federal government. This
    disruption in the credit markets, the repricing of credit risk
    and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets
    created difficult conditions for REITs and other companies to
    access capital or other sources of funds. These conditions
    included greater stock price volatility, significantly less
    liquidity, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price
    transparency. Although access to capital and other sources of
    funding improved in 2010, conditions remain difficult and could
    deteriorate further. We cannot predict for how long access to
    capital and other sources of funding will remain constrained or
    the extent to which our results of operation and financial
    condition may be adversely affected.

While we currently have no reason to believe that we will be
    unable to access our unsecured revolving credit facilities in
    the future, concern about the stability of the markets generally
    and the strength of borrowers specifically led many lenders and
    institutional investors in recent years to reduce and, in some
    cases, cease funding to borrowers. In addition, the financial
    institutions that are parties to our unsecured revolving credit
    facilities might have incurred losses or might have reduced
    capital reserves on account of their prior lending to borrowers,
    their holdings of certain mortgage securities or their other
    financial relationships. As a result, these financial
    institutions might be or become capital constrained and might
    tighten their lending standards, or become insolvent. If they
    experience shortages of capital and liquidity, or if they
    experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other
    borrowers within a short period of time, these lenders might not
    be able or willing to honor their funding commitments to us,
    which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our
    unsecured revolving credit facilities and, over time, could
    negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay
    indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make
    distributions to our stockholders. Continued adverse conditions
    in the credit markets in future years could also adversely
    affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals
    or refinancings.



To address any such capital constraints, we could, among other
    things, (i) obtain commitments from the remaining banks in
    our lending group or from new banks to fund increased amounts
    under the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities,
    (ii) access the public capital markets, (iii) obtain
    secured loans from government-sponsored entities, pension funds
    or similar sources, (iv) decrease or eliminate
    distributions to our stockholders or pay taxable stock
    dividends,

and/or

(v) delay or cease our acquisition and investment activity.
    As with other public companies, the availability of debt and
    equity capital depends, in part, on the trading levels of our
    bonds and the market price of our common stock, which, in turn,
    depend upon various market conditions, such as the market’s
    perception of our financial condition, our growth potential and
    our current and future earnings and cash distributions, that
    change from time to time. Our failure to meet the market’s
    expectation with regard to future earnings and cash
    distributions would likely adversely affect our bond trading
    levels and the market price of our common stock. Moreover, a
    significant downgrade in the ratings assigned to our long-term
    debt could cause our borrowing costs to increase and impact our
    ability to access capital. If we cannot access capital at an
    acceptable cost or at all, we may be required to liquidate one
    or more investments in properties at times that may not permit
    us to realize the maximum return on those investments, which
    could also result in adverse tax consequences to us.
    Restrictions on our uses and right to transfer our properties
    under certain healthcare regulations, ground leases, mortgages
    and other agreements to which our properties may be subject
    could adversely impact our ability to timely liquidate those
    investments and could impair the value of our properties. We
    cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the necessary
    capital to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions
    to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to
    implement our business plan, and the failure to do so could have
    a Material Adverse Effect on us.

We may
    become more leveraged.

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately
    $2.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness. The instruments
    governing our existing indebtedness permit us to incur
    substantial additional debt, and we may borrow additional funds,
    which may include secured borrowings. A high level of
    indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion
    of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service,
    thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business
    strategy and to make distributions to stockholders. A high level
    of indebtedness could also have the following consequences:

•

Potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing
    market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn
    in general economic conditions or in the real estate

and/or

healthcare industries;

•

Potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional
    financing for our business strategy; and

•

Potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one
    or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among
    other things, limiting our access to capital and increasing our
    cost of borrowing.

In addition, from time to time we mortgage our properties to
    secure payment of indebtedness. If we are unable to meet our
    mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be
    foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a
    consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one
    or more of our properties could have a Material Adverse Effect
    on us.

We are
    exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our
    profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance
    existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition and
    investment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest
    rate risk might not be effective.

We receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing our
    assets under long-term

triple-net

leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual
    rent escalations, subject to certain limitations. Certain of our
    debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest
    rate and related payments that vary with the movement of LIBOR,
    Bankers’ Acceptance or other indexes. The generally fixed
    rate nature of our revenues and the variable rate nature of
    certain of our obligations create interest rate risk. Although
    our operating assets



provide a partial hedge against interest rate fluctuations, if
    interest rates rise, our interest costs for our existing
    floating rate debt and any new debt we incur would also
    increase. This increased cost could have the effect of reducing
    our profitability or making our lease and other revenues
    insufficient to meet our obligations, and could make the
    financing of any acquisition or investment activity more costly.
    Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to
    refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay
    higher rates upon refinancing. An increase in interest rates may
    also decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for
    our assets, thereby limiting our ability to reposition our
    portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other
    conditions.

We may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility
    by using hedging arrangements that involve risk, including the
    risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations
    under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be
    effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes,
    that the amount of income we may earn from hedging transactions
    may be limited by federal tax provisions governing REITs, and
    that these arrangements may result in higher interest rates than
    we would otherwise have. Moreover, no amount of hedging activity
    can completely insulate us from the risks associated with
    changes in interest rates. Failure to hedge effectively against
    interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities,
    could adversely affect our results of operations and financial
    condition.

Covenants
    in the instruments governing our existing indebtedness limit our
    operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially
    adversely affect our operations.

The terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness
    require us to comply with a number of customary financial and
    other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage,
    leverage ratios and net worth requirements. Our continued
    ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in
    general is subject to compliance with these covenants, which
    limit our operational flexibility. Breaches of these covenants
    could result in defaults under the applicable debt instruments,
    in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against
    such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations.
    Financial and other covenants that limit our operational
    flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from our breach of
    any of these covenants, could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    us.

Risks
    Arising from Our Status as a REIT

Loss
    of our status as a REIT would have significant adverse
    consequences to us and the value of our common
    stock.

If we lose our status as a REIT (currently

and/or

with
    respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations
    has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that
    will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our
    obligations and for distribution to our stockholders for each of
    the years involved because:

•

We would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to
    stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be
    subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;

•

We also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax
    and possibly increased state and local taxes; and

•

Unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we
    could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable
    years following the year during which we were disqualified.

In addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay
    dividends to maintain REIT status. As a result of all these
    factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our
    ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely
    affect the value of our common stock.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly
    technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only
    limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The
    determination of various factual matters and circumstances not
    entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain
    qualified as a REIT. In addition, new legislation, regulations,
    administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely
    affect



our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a REIT for
    tax purposes. Although we believe that we qualify as a REIT, we
    cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain
    qualified as a REIT for tax purposes.

The
    90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may
    limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial
    transactions.

To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to
    REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make
    distributions to our stockholders. See “Certain
    U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations —
    Requirements for Qualification as a REIT — Annual
    Distribution Requirements” included in Item 1 of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The indentures governing our outstanding senior notes permit us
    to make annual distributions to our stockholders in an amount
    equal to the minimum amount necessary to maintain our REIT
    status so long as the ratio of our Debt to Adjusted Total Assets
    (as each term is defined in the indentures) does not exceed 60%
    and to make additional distributions if we pass certain other
    financial tests. However, distributions may limit our ability to
    rely upon rental payments from our properties or subsequently
    acquired properties to finance investments, acquisitions or new
    developments.

Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient
    cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT
    distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to
    time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to
    meet the 90% distribution requirement. This may be due to timing
    differences between the actual receipt of income and actual
    payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the
    inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in
    arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition,
    non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or
    repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash
    deductions also may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or
    liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution
    requirement.

In the event that timing differences occur or we decide to
    retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be
    necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may, if
    possible, borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay
    taxable stock dividends, distribute other property or securities
    or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the
    REIT distribution requirements. Any of these actions may require
    us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however,
    see “— Risks Arising from Our Capital
    Structure — Limitations on our ability to access
    capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our
    debt payments, make distributions to our stockholders or make
    future investments necessary to implement our business
    plan.” The terms of the instruments governing our existing
    indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in some of these
    transactions.

To
    preserve our qualification as a REIT, our certificate of
    incorporation contains ownership limits with respect to our
    capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of
    control of our company.

To assist us in preserving our qualification as a REIT, our
    certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires
    beneficial ownership of more than 9.9% of our outstanding
    preferred stock or 9.0% of our common stock, the shares that are
    beneficially owned in excess of the applicable limit are
    considered to be “excess shares” and are automatically
    deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable
    institution or other qualifying organization selected by our
    Board of Directors. The trust is entitled to all dividends with
    respect to the excess shares and the trustee may exercise all
    voting power over the excess shares. We have the right to buy
    the excess shares for a purchase price equal to the lesser of
    (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the
    excess shares or (ii) the market price on the day we buy
    the shares, but if we do not purchase them, the trustee of the
    trust is required to transfer the excess shares at the direction
    of our Board of Directors. These ownership limits could delay,
    defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might
    involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise
    be in the best interests of our stockholders.



If we
    decide to pay taxable stock dividends to meet the REIT
    distribution requirements, your tax liability may be greater
    than the amount of cash you receive.

Under Revenue Procedure 2010-12, the IRS has stated that it will
    treat stock dividends as distributions for purposes of
    satisfying the REIT distribution requirements for calendar years
    2008 through 2012 if each stockholder can elect to receive the
    distribution in cash, even if the aggregate cash amount paid to
    all stockholders is limited, provided certain requirements are
    met. Accordingly, if we decide to pay a stock dividend in
    accordance with Revenue Procedure

2010-12,

your tax liability with respect to such dividend may be
    significantly greater than the amount of cash you receive.

Properties

Seniors
    Housing and Healthcare Properties

As of December 31, 2010, we owned 602 assets: 240 seniors
    housing communities, 187 skilled nursing facilities, 40
    hospitals and 135 MOBs and other properties in 43
    U.S. states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian
    provinces. We believe that the asset class, geographic, revenue
    source and business model diversity of our portfolio makes us
    less susceptible to regional economic downturns and adverse
    changes in regulation or reimbursement rates or methodologies in
    any single state.

At December 31, 2010, we had mortgage loan obligations
    outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of
    $1.3 billion, secured by 114 of our properties.

As of February 11, 2011, we had 162,920,524 shares of

    stockholders of record.

Dividends
    and Distributions

We pay regular quarterly dividends to holders of our common
    stock to comply with the provisions of the Code governing REITs.
    On February 16, 2011, our Board of Directors declared the
    first quarterly installment of our 2011 dividend in the amount
    of $0.575 per share, payable in cash on March 31, 2011 to
    stockholders of record on March 11, 2011. We expect to
    distribute at least 100% of our taxable net income to our
    stockholders for 2011. See “Certain U.S. Federal
    Income Tax Considerations — Requirements for
    Qualification as a REIT — Annual Distribution
    Requirements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Our Board of Directors normally makes decisions regarding the
    nature, frequency and amount of our dividends on a quarterly
    basis. Because the Board considers a number of factors when
    making these decisions, including our current and future
    liquidity needs and position, current and projected results from
    operations and performance and credit quality of our tenants,
    operators, managers and borrowers, we cannot assure you that we
    will maintain the policy stated above. Please see
    “Cautionary Statements” and the risk factors included
    in



Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for a description of other factors that may affect our
    distribution policy.

Our stockholders may reinvest all or a portion of any cash
    distribution on their shares of our common stock by
    participating in our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock
    Purchase Plan, subject to the terms of the plan. See
    “Note 16 — Capital Stock” of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Director
    and Employee Stock Sales

Certain of our directors, executive officers and other employees
    have adopted and may, from time to time in the future, adopt
    non-discretionary, written trading plans that comply with

Rule 10b5-1

under the Exchange Act, or otherwise monetize their equity-based
    compensation.

Our Amended and Restated Securities Trading Policy generally
    prohibits our directors, executive officers and other employees
    from pledging our equity securities to secure “margin
    loans.”

Stock
    Repurchases

The table below summarizes repurchases of our common stock made

Repurchases represent shares withheld to pay taxes on the

    to employees. The value of the shares withheld is the closing
    price of our common stock on the date the vesting or exercise
    occurs.



Stock
    Performance Graph

The following performance graph compares the cumulative total
    return (including dividends) to the holders of our common stock
    from December 31, 2005 through December 31, 2010, with
    the cumulative total returns of the NYSE Composite Index, the
    FTSE NAREIT Composite REIT Index (the “Composite REIT
    Index”), the FTSE NAREIT Healthcare Equity REIT Index (the
    “Healthcare REIT Index”) and the S&P 500 Index
    over the same period. The comparison assumes $100 was invested
    on December 31, 2005 in our common stock and in each of the
    foregoing indexes and assumes reinvestment of dividends, as
    applicable. We have included the NYSE Composite Index in the
    performance graph because our common stock is listed on the
    NYSE. We have included the other indexes (other than the
    S&P 500 Index, of which we are a member) because we believe
    that they are either most representative of the industry in
    which we compete, or otherwise provide a fair basis for
    comparison with us, and are therefore particularly relevant to
    an assessment of our performance. The figures in the table below
    are rounded to the nearest dollar.

Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted Financial Accounting
    Standards Board guidance relating to convertible debt
    instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion. See
    “Note 2 — Accounting Policies” of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for detail regarding the impact of the adoption on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)

We believe that net income, as defined by generally accepted
    accounting principles (“GAAP”), is the most
    appropriate earnings measurement. However, we consider Funds
    From Operations (“FFO”) and normalized FFO appropriate
    measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. Moreover,
    we believe that normalized FFO provides useful information
    because it allows investors, analysts and our management to



compare our operating performance to the operating performance
    of other real estate companies and between periods on a
    consistent basis without having to account for differences
    caused by unanticipated items. We use the National Association
    of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) definition
    of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance
    with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real
    estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization,
    and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint
    ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint
    ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We
    define normalized FFO as FFO excluding the following items
    (which may be recurring in nature): (a) gains and losses on
    the sales of real property assets; (b) merger-related costs
    and expenses, including amortization of intangibles and
    transition and integration expenses, and deal costs and
    expenses, including expenses and recoveries, if any, relating to
    our lawsuit against HCP, Inc. and the issuance of preferred
    stock or bridge loan fees; (c) the impact of any expenses
    related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the
    write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional
    costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or
    premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of
    our debt; (d) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or
    expenses; (e) the impact of future unannounced acquisitions
    or divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to
    purchase) and capital transactions; (f) the reversal or
    incurrence of contingent liabilities; (g) gains and losses
    for non-operational foreign currency hedge agreements; and
    (h) one-time expenses in connection with the Kindred rent
    reset process. FFO and normalized FFO presented herein are not
    necessarily identical to FFO and normalized FFO presented by
    other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real
    estate companies use the same definitions. FFO and normalized
    FFO should not be considered alternatives to net income
    (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our
    financial performance or alternatives to cash flow from
    operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as
    measures of our liquidity, nor are FFO and normalized FFO
    necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of
    our needs. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Funds From Operations” included in Item 7 of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for a reconciliation of these measures to our GAAP earnings.

Corporate
    and Operating Environment

We are a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) with a
    geographically diverse portfolio of seniors housing and
    healthcare properties in the United States and Canada. As of
    December 31, 2010, our portfolio consisted of 602 assets:
    240 seniors housing communities, 187 skilled nursing facilities,
    40 hospitals and 135 medical office buildings (“MOBs”)
    and other properties in 43 U.S. states, the District of
    Columbia and two Canadian



provinces. With the exception of our seniors housing communities
    that are managed by independent third parties, such as Sunrise
    Senior Living, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries,
    “Sunrise”), pursuant to long-term management
    agreements and certain of our MOBs, other than those acquired in
    connection with our Lillibridge Healthcare Services, Inc.
    (“Lillibridge”) acquisition (see
    “Note 4 — Acquisitions of Real Estate
    Property” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K),

we lease our properties to healthcare operating companies under

“triple-net”

or “absolute net” leases, which require the tenants to
    pay all property-related expenses. We also had real estate loan
    and other investments relating to seniors housing and healthcare
    companies or properties as of December 31, 2010.

Our primary business consists of acquiring, financing and owning
    seniors housing and healthcare properties and leasing those
    properties to third parties or operating those properties
    through independent third-party managers. Through our
    Lillibridge subsidiary, we also provide management, leasing,
    marketing, facility development and advisory services to highly
    rated hospitals and health systems throughout the United States.

We currently operate through three reportable business segments:

triple-net

leased properties, senior living operations and MOB operations.
    See “Note 19 — Segment Information” of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

As of December 31, 2010, we had: 100% ownership interests
    in 538 of our properties, including all 79 of our seniors
    housing communities managed by Sunrise; controlling interests in
    six MOBs owned through joint ventures with partners who provide
    management and leasing services for the properties; and
    noncontrolling interests ranging between 5% and 20% in 58 MOBs
    owned through joint ventures with institutional third party
    partners. Through our Lillibridge subsidiary, we also managed an
    additional 31 MOBs for third parties as of December 31,
    2010.

Our business strategy is comprised of three principal
    objectives: (1) generating consistent, reliable and growing
    cash flows; (2) maintaining a well-diversified portfolio;
    and (3) preserving our investment grade balance sheet and
    liquidity.

Access to external capital is critical to the success of our
    strategy as it impacts our ability to repay maturing
    indebtedness and to make future investments. Our access to and
    cost of capital depend on various factors, including general
    market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our
    securities, perception of our potential future earnings and cash
    distributions and the market price of our common stock.
    Generally, we attempt to match the long-term duration of most of
    our investments with long-term fixed rate financing. At
    December 31, 2010, only 5.3% of our consolidated debt was
    variable rate debt.

    Operating Highlights

    Highlights

•

Since February 2010, our senior unsecured debt securities have
    maintained investment grade ratings by all three nationally
    recognized rating agencies.

•

During 2010, we received $235.0 million of additional
    capital commitments for the portion of indebtedness under our
    unsecured revolving credit facilities maturing in 2012. We now
    have $1.0 billion of aggregate borrowing capacity under our
    unsecured revolving credit facilities, all of which matures on
    April 26, 2012.

•

Our Board of Directors declared four quarterly installments of
    our 2010 dividend in the amount of $0.535 per share,
    representing a 4.4% increase over our 2009 quarterly dividend.
    The quarterly installments of our 2010 dividend were paid in
    cash in March, June, September and December.

•

During 2010, we sold seven seniors housing communities for
    approximately $60.5 million, including lease termination
    fees of $0.7 million, and recognized a gain from these
    sales of approximately $17.3 million.



•

In July 2010, we completed the acquisition of businesses owned
    and operated by Lillibridge and its related entities and their
    real estate interests in 96 MOBs and ambulatory facilities for
    approximately $381 million, including the assumption of
    $79.5 million of debt. As a result of the transaction, we
    acquired: a 100% interest in Lillibridge’s property
    management, leasing, construction and development, advisory and
    asset management services business; a 100% interest in 38 MOBs
    comprising 1.9 million square feet; a 20% joint venture
    interest in 24 MOBs comprising 1.5 million square feet; and
    a 5% joint venture interest in 34 MOBs comprising
    2.3 million square feet. We are the managing member of
    these joint ventures and the property manager for the joint
    venture properties. Two institutional third parties hold the
    controlling interests in these joint ventures, and we have a
    right of first offer on those interests. We funded the
    acquisition with cash on hand, borrowings under our unsecured
    revolving credit facilities and the assumption of mortgage debt.
    In connection with the acquisition, $132.7 million of
    mortgage debt was repaid. In December 2010, we purchased five
    MOBs under the Lillibridge platform for an aggregate purchase
    price of $36.6 million. Our portfolio now includes 158
    owned or managed MOBs comprising 8.8 million square feet in
    19 states and the District of Columbia.

•

In September 2010, we entered into a $200.0 million
    three-year unsecured term loan with Bank of America, N.A., as
    lender. The term loan is

non-amortizing

and bears interest at an all-in fixed rate of 4% per annum. The
    term loan contains the same restrictive covenants as our
    unsecured revolving credit facilities.

•

In October 2010, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire
    substantially all of the real estate assets of privately-owned
    Atria Senior Living Group, Inc. (together with its affiliates,
    “Atria”) for a total purchase price of
    $3.1 billion, comprised of $1.35 billion of our common
    stock (a fixed 24.96 million shares), $150 million in
    cash and the assumption or repayment of $1.6 billion of net
    debt. We will acquire from Atria 118 private pay seniors housing
    communities located primarily in affluent coastal markets such
    as the New York metropolitan area, New England and California.
    Atria, based in Louisville, Kentucky, is owned by private equity
    funds managed by Lazard Real Estate Partners. Prior to the
    closing, Atria will spin off its management company, which will
    continue to operate the acquired assets under long-term
    management agreements with us. Completion of the transaction is
    subject to certain conditions. We expect to complete the
    transaction in the first half of 2011, although we cannot assure
    you that the transaction will close on such timetable or at all.

•

In November 2010, we sold $400.0 million aggregate
    principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due 2015 issued by
    our subsidiaries, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership
    (“Ventas Realty”) and Ventas Capital Corporation, at a
    public offering price equal to 99.528% of par, for total
    proceeds of $398.1 million, before the underwriting
    discount and expenses.

•

During 2010, we purchased or repaid $215.7 million
    aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes, and
    our mortgage debt obligations decreased by $190.5 million.

•

In December 2010, we acquired Sunrise’s noncontrolling
    interests in 58 of our seniors housing communities currently
    managed by Sunrise for a total valuation of approximately
    $186 million, including assumption of Sunrise’s share
    of mortgage debt totaling $144 million. The noncontrolling
    interests acquired represented between 15% and 25% ownership
    interests in the communities, and we now own 100% of all 79 of
    our seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise.

•

In December 2010, we and Sunrise modified the management
    agreements with respect to each of our 79 Sunrise-managed
    seniors housing communities. Among other things, the
    modifications included: reduction of the management fee paid to
    Sunrise for the period from April 1, 2010 through
    December 31, 2010 and for all of 2011 to 3.50% and 3.75%
    per annum, respectively, after which the annual base management
    fee will equal 6% of revenues (with a range of 5% to 7%); a cap
    on the amount of incentive management fees payable to Sunrise
    and allocated “shared services” expenses; enhanced
    rights and remedies for us in the event of a Sunrise default;
    and reallocation of the net operating income (“NOI”)
    performance thresholds to include a cushion for all 79
    communities.



Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

have been prepared in accordance with GAAP set forth in the
    Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), as
    published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”). GAAP requires us to make estimates and
    assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. We base these estimates on our experience and on
    various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the
    circumstances. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the
    facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or
    other matters had been different, a different accounting
    treatment may have been applied, resulting in a different
    presentation of our financial statements. We periodically
    re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event they
    prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments
    in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and
    assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. We
    believe that the critical accounting policies described below,
    among others, affect our more significant estimates and
    judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements.
    For more information regarding our critical accounting policies,
    see “Note 2 — Accounting Policies” of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned
    subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we
    exercise control. All intercompany transactions and balances
    have been eliminated in consolidation, and net earnings are
    reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to
    noncontrolling interests. We apply FASB guidance for
    arrangements with variable interest entities (“VIEs”),
    which requires us to identify entities for which control is
    achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine
    which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
    We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are determined to be
    the primary beneficiary of the VIE.

We must make judgments regarding our level of influence or
    control over an entity and whether we are (or are not) the
    primary beneficiary of a VIE. We identify the primary
    beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both of the
    following characteristics: (i) the power to direct the
    activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the
    entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation
    to absorb losses or receive benefits of the VIE that could
    potentially be significant to the entity. We perform this
    analysis on an ongoing basis, and our ability to make accurate
    judgments regarding our influence or control over an entity and
    to determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the
    presentation of these entities in our Consolidated Financial
    Statements. In the future, our assumptions may change, which
    could result in the identification of a different primary
    beneficiary.

Long-Lived
    Assets and Intangibles

We record investments in real estate assets at cost. We account
    for acquisitions using the purchase method and allocate the cost
    of the properties acquired among tangible and recognized
    intangible assets and liabilities based upon their estimated
    fair values as of the acquisition date. Recognized intangibles
    primarily include the value of in-place leases, acquired lease
    contracts, tenant and customer relationships, trade
    names/trademarks and goodwill.

Our method for allocating the purchase price paid to acquire
    investments in real estate requires us to make subjective
    assessments for determining fair value of the assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed. This includes determining the value of
    the buildings and improvements, land and improvements, ground
    leases, tenant improvements, in-place leases, above

and/or

below
    market leases and any debt assumed. These estimates require
    significant judgment and in some cases involve complex
    calculations. These allocation assessments directly impact our
    results of operations, as amounts allocated to certain assets
    and liabilities have different depreciation or amortization
    lives. In addition, we amortize the value assigned to above

and/or

below



market leases as a component of revenue, unlike in-place leases
    and other intangibles, which we include in depreciation and
    amortization in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

We estimate the fair value of buildings on an as-if-vacant basis
    and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining
    life of the building. We determine the allocated value of other
    fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such
    value over the assets’ estimated remaining useful lives. We
    determine the value of land based on real estate tax assessed
    values in relation to the total value of the asset, on internal
    analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties
    within our portfolio or by considering the sales prices of
    similar properties in recent transactions. The fair value of
    lease intangibles, if any, reflects (i) the estimated value
    of any above

and/or

below
    market leases, determined by discounting the difference between
    the estimated current market rent and the in-place rentals, the
    resulting intangible asset or liability of which is amortized to
    revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any
    fixed rate renewal periods, (ii) the estimated value of
    in-place leases related to the cost to obtain tenants, including
    tenant allowances, tenant improvements and leasing commissions,
    and an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the
    value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a
    reasonable

lease-up

period, as if the acquired space was vacant, which is amortized
    over the remaining life of the associated lease, and
    (iii) the estimated value of any above

and/or

below
    market ground leases, determined by discounting the difference
    between the estimated market rental rate and the in-place lease
    rate, which is amortized over the remaining life of the
    associated lease. We estimate the value of tenant or other
    customer relationships acquired, if any, by considering the
    nature and extent of existing business relationships with the
    tenant or customer, growth prospects for developing new business
    with the tenant or customer, the tenant’s credit quality,
    expectations of lease renewals with the tenant, and the
    potential for significant, additional future leasing
    arrangements with the tenant and amortize that value over the
    expected life of the associated arrangements or leases, which
    includes the remaining terms of the related leases and any
    expected renewal periods. We estimate the value of trade
    names/trademarks using a royalty rate methodology and amortize
    the resulting intangible over the estimated useful life. We
    calculate the fair value of long-term debt by discounting the
    remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the
    current market rate for those borrowings, which we approximate
    based on the rate we would expect to incur to replace each
    instrument on the date of acquisition, and recognize any fair
    value adjustments related to long-term debt as effective yield
    adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument. We do not
    amortize goodwill, which is the excess of the purchase price
    paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired
    business.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily
    consisting of our investments in real estate, for impairment
    indicators. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate
    the carrying value of the related real estate investments in
    relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying
    operations, and we adjust the net book value of leased
    properties and other long-lived assets to fair value if the sum
    of the expected future undiscounted cash flows including sales
    proceeds is less than book value. An impairment loss is
    recognized at the time we make any such determination. If
    impairment indicators arise with respect to intangible assets
    with finite useful lives, we evaluate impairment by comparing
    the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future
    undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the asset. If
    estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the
    carrying amount of the asset, then the fair value of the asset
    is estimated. We determine the impairment expense by comparing
    the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying
    value and recognize any shortfall from fair value as an expense
    in the current period. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at
    least annually, but more frequently if indicators arise. We
    compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which
    the goodwill has been assigned with the reporting unit’s
    carrying value. The fair values used in this evaluation of
    goodwill and real estate investments and intangibles are
    estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections.
    These cash flow projections are based upon a number of estimates
    and assumptions, such as revenue and expense growth rates and
    discount rates.



Business
    Combinations

For our acquisitions, we measure the assets acquired,
    liabilities assumed (including contingencies) and any
    noncontrolling interests at their fair values on the acquisition
    date. Our acquisition-related transaction costs are included in
    merger-related expenses and deal costs on our Consolidated
    Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2010
    and 2009. Prior to January 1, 2009, these costs were
    capitalized as part of the asset value at the time of the
    acquisition, as required by FASB guidance in effect at that time.

Loans
    Receivable

Loans receivable are stated at the unpaid principal balance net
    of any deferred origination fees, purchase discounts or premiums

and/or

valuation allowances. Net deferred origination fees, which are
    comprised of loan fees collected from the borrower net of
    certain direct costs, and purchase discounts or premiums are
    amortized to income over the contractual life of the loan using
    the effective interest method. We evaluate the collectibility of
    loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on a
    number of factors, including (i) corporate and
    facility-level financial and operational reports,
    (ii) compliance with the financial covenants set forth in
    the applicable loan or lease agreement, (iii) the financial
    stability of the borrower or tenant and any guarantor,
    (iv) the payment history of the borrower or tenant, and
    (v) current economic conditions. Our level of reserves, if
    any, for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties
    fluctuates depending upon all of these factors. We record a
    reserve at the time it is probable that we will be unable to
    collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of
    the loan agreement, including the contractual interest and
    principal payments of the loan. At the time a reserve is
    recorded, we typically cease recognizing interest income on the
    loan.

Fair
    Value

We follow FASB guidance that defines fair value and provides
    direction for measuring fair value and making the necessary
    disclosures. The guidance emphasizes that fair value is a
    market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement,
    and should be determined based on the assumptions that market
    participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a
    basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair
    value measurements, the guidance establishes a fair value
    hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant
    assumptions based on market data obtained from sources
    independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are
    classified within levels one and two of the hierarchy) and the
    reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant
    assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within level three
    of the hierarchy).

Level one inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting
    entity has the ability to access. Level two inputs are inputs
    other than quoted prices included in level one that are directly
    or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level two
    inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and
    liabilities in active markets, as well as other observable
    inputs for the asset or liability, such as interest rates,
    foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at
    commonly quoted intervals. Level three inputs are unobservable
    inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on
    the reporting entity’s own assumptions, as there is little,
    if any, related market activity. In instances where the
    determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs
    from different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which
    the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest
    level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in
    its entirety. Additionally, if an entity determines there has
    been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity
    for an asset or liability relative to the normal market activity
    for such asset or liability (or similar assets or liabilities),
    then transactions or quoted prices may not accurately reflect
    fair value. In addition, if there is evidence that the
    transaction for the asset or liability is not orderly, the
    entity shall place little, if any, weight on that transaction
    price as an indicator of fair value. Our assessment of the
    significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement
    in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific
    to the asset or liability.

We record marketable debt and equity securities as

available-for-sale

and classify them as a component of other assets on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. These securities are recorded at
    fair market value, with



unrealized gains and losses recorded in stockholders’
    equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
    on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We report interest income,
    including discount or premium amortization, on marketable debt
    securities and gains or losses on securities sold, which are
    based on the specific identification method, in income from
    loans and investments on our Consolidated Statements of Income.

We determined the fair value of our current investments in
    marketable securities using level one inputs. We determined the
    valuation allowance for loan losses based on level three inputs.
    See “Note 6 — Loans Receivable” of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The estimated fair values of tangible and intangible assets and
    liabilities recorded in connection with business combinations
    are based on level three inputs. We estimate fair values based
    on cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and/or
    capitalization rates and available market information.

We determine impairment in real estate investments, including
    intangibles and goodwill, utilizing cash flow projections
    that apply estimated revenue and expense growth rates, discount
    rates and capitalization rates, which are classified as level
    three inputs.

We also follow FASB guidance requiring entities to separate an

other-than-temporary

impairment of a fixed maturity security into two components when
    (i) there are credit losses associated with the security
    that management asserts that it does not have an intent to sell
    and (ii) it is more likely than not that the entity will
    not be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost
    basis. The amount of the

other-than-temporary

impairment related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings,
    and the amount of the

other-than-temporary

impairment related to other factors is recorded in other
    comprehensive loss. We have not recognized any

other-than-temporary

impairments.

Revenue
    Recognition

Certain of our leases, including the majority of our leases with
    Brookdale Senior Living and the majority of our MOB leases,
    provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. We
    recognize base rental revenues under these leases on a
    straight-line basis over the term of the applicable lease.
    Income on our straight-line revenue is recognized when
    collectibility is reasonably assured, and in the event we
    determine that collectibility of straight-line revenue is not
    reasonably assured, we establish an allowance for estimated
    losses. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis
    results in recognized revenue exceeding cash amounts
    contractually due from our tenants during the first half of the
    term for leases that have straight-line treatment.

Our master lease agreements with Kindred (the “Kindred
    Master Leases”) and certain of our other leases provide for
    an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue
    parameters or other substantive contingencies are met. We
    recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only
    if such parameters or contingencies are met, rather than on a
    straight-line basis over the term of the applicable lease.

We recognize income from rent, lease termination fees,
    management advisory services and all other income once all of
    the following criteria are met in accordance with Securities and
    Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) Staff Accounting
    Bulletin 104: (i) the applicable agreement has been
    fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have been
    rendered; (iii) the amount is fixed or determinable; and
    (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured.

We recognize resident fees and services, other than move-in
    fees, monthly as services are provided. We recognize move-in
    fees on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable
    lease agreement. Lease agreements with residents generally have
    a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with
    30 days’ notice.



Federal
    Income Tax

Since we have elected to be treated as a REIT under the
    applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended (the “Code”), we made no provision for federal
    income tax purposes prior to our acquisition of the assets of
    Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust
    (“Sunrise REIT”) in April 2007. As a result of the
    Sunrise REIT acquisition, we now record income tax expense or
    benefit with respect to certain of our entities which are taxed
    as “taxable REIT subsidiaries” under provisions
    similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not
    under the REIT provisions.

We account for deferred income taxes using the asset and
    liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and
    liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events
    that have been included in our financial statements or tax
    returns. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and
    liabilities based on the differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted
    tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
    expected to reverse. An increase or decrease in the deferred tax
    liability that results from a change in circumstances, and which
    causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax
    consequences of events, would be included in the tax provision
    when such changes occur. Deferred income taxes also reflect the
    impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A
    valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely
    than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will
    not be realized. An increase or decrease in the valuation
    allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and which
    causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the
    related deferred tax asset, would be included in the tax
    provision when such changes occur.

Recently
    Adopted Accounting Standards

On December 21, 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
    Update (“ASU”)

2010-29,

which impacts any public entity that enters into business
    combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate
    basis. The guidance specifies that if a public entity presents
    comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose
    revenues and earnings of the combined entity as though the
    business combination(s) that occurred during the year had
    occurred at the beginning of the prior annual period when
    preparing the pro forma financial information for both the
    current and prior reporting periods. The guidance also requires
    that pro forma disclosures be accompanied by a narrative
    description regarding the nature and amount of material,
    nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the
    business combination included in reported pro forma revenues and
    earnings. This guidance is effective for business combinations
    consummated in periods beginning after December 15, 2010.
    We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2011. We do not
    believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material
    impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Results
    of Operations

As of December 31, 2010, we operated through three
    reportable business segments:

triple-net

leased properties, senior living operations and MOB operations.
    Our

triple-net

leased properties segment consists of acquiring and owning
    seniors housing and healthcare properties in the United States
    and leasing those properties to healthcare operating companies
    under

“triple-net”

or

“absolute-net”

leases, which require the tenants to pay all property-related
    expenses. Our senior living operations segment primarily
    consists of investments in seniors housing communities located
    in the United States and Canada for which we engage independent
    third parties, such as Sunrise, to manage the operations. Our
    MOB operations segment primarily consists of acquiring, owning,
    developing, leasing and managing MOBs.

With the addition of the Lillibridge businesses and properties
    in July 2010, we believed the segregation of our MOB operations
    into its own reporting segment would be useful in assessing the
    performance of this portion of our business in the same way that
    management intends to review our performance and make operating
    decisions. Prior to the acquisition, we operated through two
    reportable segments:

triple-net

leased properties and senior living operations.

Segment
    NOI —

Triple-Net

Leased Properties

NOI for our

triple-net

leased properties segment consists solely of rental income
    earned from these assets. We incur no direct operating expenses
    for this segment.

The

year-over-year

increase in

triple-net

leased properties segment NOI primarily reflects
    $6.2 million of additional rent resulting from the annual
    escalators in the rent paid under the Kindred Master Leases
    effective May 1, 2010, $0.8 million in additional rent
    from a seniors housing community we acquired in 2010 and various
    other escalations in the rent paid on our other existing
    properties.

Revenues related to our

triple-net

leased properties segment consist of fixed rental amounts
    (subject to annual escalations) received directly from our
    tenants based on the terms of the applicable leases and
    generally do not depend on the operating performance of our
    properties. Therefore, while occupancy information is relevant
    to the operations of our tenants, our revenues and financial
    results are not directly impacted by the overall occupancy
    levels or profits at the

triple-net

leased properties. Average occupancy rates related to



triple-net

leased properties we owned at December 31, 2010, for the
    third quarter of 2010, which is the most recent information
    available to us from our tenants, are shown below.

Revenues related to our senior living operations segment are
    resident fees and services, which include all amounts earned
    from residents at our seniors housing communities, such as
    rental fees related to resident leases, extended health care
    fees and other ancillary service income. The

year-over-year

increase in senior living operations segment revenues is
    attributed primarily to a decrease in the average Canadian
    dollar exchange rate, which had a favorable impact of
    $8.2 million in 2010, $3.3 million of additional
    revenues from three seniors housing communities added to our
    portfolio in 2010 and late 2009, higher occupancy rates and
    higher average daily rates in our Sunrise-managed communities.
    Average resident occupancy rates related to our senior living
    operations during 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

Property-level operating expenses related to our senior living
    operations segment include labor, food, utility, marketing,
    management and other property operating costs. Property-level
    operating expenses increased in 2010 over 2009 primarily due to
    a decrease in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate, which
    had an unfavorable impact of $5.4 million in 2010,
    $3.1 million of additional expenses from three seniors
    housing communities added to our portfolio in 2010 and late 2009
    and increased expenses related to occupancy and revenue growth,
    partially offset by the receipt of a $5 million cash
    payment from Sunrise in 2010 for expense overages and a decrease
    of $4.2 million in management fees.

Segment
    NOI — All Other

All other NOI consists solely of income from loans and
    investments. Income from loans and investments increased in 2010
    over the prior year due primarily to interest earned on the
    investments we made during 2010 and 2009.

Interest
    Expense

Total interest expense, including interest allocated to
    discontinued operations of $1.1 million and
    $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively, increased $0.2 million in 2010 over
    2009. This difference is due primarily to increased deferred
    financing fee amortization, increased land lease payments and a
    $0.4 million increase in interest from higher effective
    interest rates, partially offset by a $2.7 million
    reduction in interest from lower loan balances. Interest expense
    includes $9.0 million and $7.4 million of amortized
    deferred financing fees for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our
    effective interest rate was 6.4% for 2010, compared to 6.3% for
    2009. A decrease in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate
    had an unfavorable impact on interest expense of
    $0.7 million for 2010, compared to 2009.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a
    result of the properties we acquired or developed during 2010
    and 2009, including the Lillibridge portfolio.



General,
    Administrative and Professional Fees

General, administrative and professional fees increased
    $11.0 million in 2010 over 2009 due primarily to the
    Lillibridge acquisition.

Foreign
    Currency Gain/Loss

The foreign currency loss in 2010 resulted primarily from the
    net change in our forward contract valuation compared to the
    revaluation of intercompany loans, partially offset by the
    Canadian exchange rate differential between the trade date and
    settlement date on a cash payment.

Loss on
    Extinguishment of Debt

The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2010 relates primarily to
    our redemption in June 2010 of all $142.7 million principal
    amount then outstanding of our


/


% senior
    notes due 2015, our redemption in October 2010 of all
    $71.7 million principal amount then outstanding of our


/


% senior
    notes due 2014 and various mortgage repayments in December 2010.
    The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2009 primarily relates to
    the purchase, in open market transactions

and/or

through cash tender offers, of $361.6 million aggregate
    principal amount of our outstanding senior notes.

Merger-Related
    Expenses and Deal Costs

Merger-related expenses and deal costs consisted of expenses
    relating to our favorable $101.6 million jury verdict
    against HCP, Inc. (“HCP”) and subsequent cross-appeals
    arising out of our Sunrise REIT acquisition, integration costs
    related to consummated transactions and deal costs required by
    GAAP to be expensed rather than capitalized into the asset
    value, which include certain fees and expenses incurred in
    connection with the Lillibridge acquisition and other deal costs
    for unconsummated transactions, including our pending Atria
    acquisition.

Loss From
    Unconsolidated Entities

Loss from unconsolidated entities for 2010 relates to the
    noncontrolling interests in joint ventures we acquired as part
    of the Lillibridge acquisition. We have ownership interests
    ranging between 5% and 20% in 58 MOBs. See
    “Note 4 — Acquisitions of Real Estate
    Property” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Income
    Tax Expense/Benefit

Income tax expense/benefit before noncontrolling interest
    represents amounts related to our taxable REIT subsidiaries as a
    result of the Sunrise REIT and Lillibridge acquisitions. The
    change from an income tax benefit in 2009 to a non-cash income
    tax expense in 2010 is primarily due to increased NOI at our
    Sunrise-managed seniors housing communities. See
    “Note 12 — Income Taxes” of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Discontinued
    Operations

Discontinued operations for 2010 includes a $17.3 million
    gain on the sale of seven assets sold during 2010, lease
    termination fees of $0.7 million related to these assets
    and a $7.9 million previously deferred gain recognized in
    the fourth quarter of 2010 upon repayment of a note to the
    buyer. Discontinued operations for 2009 includes a
    $66.8 million net gain on the sale of fourteen assets sold
    during 2009 and a lease termination fee of $2.3 million
    related to these assets.

Net
    Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax
    primarily represents Sunrise’s share of net income from its
    previous ownership percentage in 60 of our seniors housing
    communities during 2009 and 58 of our seniors housing
    communities for most of 2010.

    additional rent relating to a

Our senior living operations segment revenues decreased in 2009
    from the prior year primarily due to an increase in the average
    Canadian dollar exchange rate, which had an unfavorable impact
    of $5.0 million in 2009, and lower average occupancy in our
    communities. Average resident occupancy rates related to our

The decrease in property-level operating expenses for 2009 over

    partially offset by approximately $4 million of
    property-level expense credits and reconciliations related to

Our MOB operations segment revenues increased in 2009 over 2008
    due primarily to additional rent relating to the MOBs we
    acquired during 2008 and 2009. Occupancy rates related to our
    MOBs for 2009 and 2008 were as follows:

The increase in property-level operating expenses during 2009
    over 2008 is attributed primarily to the MOBs we acquired during
    2008 and 2009.

Segment
    NOI — All Other

All other NOI in 2009 consists solely of income from loans and
    investments, while 2008 includes a $6.0 million loan
    receivable valuation allowance not related to our reporting
    segments. Income from loans and investments increased
    $4.3 million in 2009 over 2008 due primarily to interest
    earned on the investments we made during 2008 and 2009.

Interest
    and Other Income

The decrease in our interest and other income during 2009 is
    primarily attributable to the resolution in 2008 of a legal
    dispute and higher interest rates earned on cash balances in
    2008.

Interest
    Expense

Total interest expense, including interest allocated to
    discontinued operations of $2.7 million and
    $10.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively, decreased $33.4 million during 2009
    over 2008. This difference is due primarily to a
    $8.6 million reduction in interest from lower effective
    interest rates and a $25.6 million reduction in interest
    from lower loan balances. Interest expense includes
    $7.4 million and $6.4 million of amortized deferred
    financing fees for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our effective
    interest rate decreased to 6.3% for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, from 6.6% for the prior year. An
    increase in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate had a
    favorable impact on interest expense of $0.4 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the same
    period in 2008.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Approximately $28.9 million of the decrease in 2009
    depreciation and amortization expense is due to in-place lease
    intangibles related to the Sunrise REIT acquisition in 2007,
    which were fully amortized during the second quarter of 2008.

General,
    Administrative and Professional Fees

The decrease in general, administrative and professional fees
    during 2009 is a result of lower professional fees and dead deal
    costs recorded in 2008, partially offset by an increase in
    non-cash stock-based compensation.

Loss on
    Extinguishment of Debt

The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2009 primarily relates to
    the purchase, in open market transactions

and/or

through cash tender offers, of $361.6 million aggregate
    principal amount of our outstanding senior



notes. The gain on extinguishment of debt in 2008 primarily
    represents the purchase of $176.4 million aggregate
    principal amount of our outstanding senior notes in open market
    transactions for a discount.

Merger-Related
    Expenses and Deal Costs

Merger-related expenses and deal costs consisted of expenses
    relating to our favorable $101.6 million jury verdict
    against HCP arising out of our Sunrise REIT acquisition and,
    during 2009, deal costs required by GAAP to be expensed rather
    than capitalized into the asset value.

Reversal
    of Contingent Liability

We had a $23.3 million deferred tax liability for any
    built-in gains tax related to the disposition of certain assets
    owned or deemed to be owned by us prior to our REIT election in
    1999. The ten-year period in which these assets were subject to
    built-in gains tax ended on December 31, 2008. Because we
    had no pending or planned dispositions of these assets through
    December 31, 2008 and did not expect to pay any amounts
    related to this contingent liability, the $23.3 million
    deferred tax liability was reversed into income during 2008.

Income
    Tax Benefit

Income tax benefit before noncontrolling interest represents a
    deferred benefit which is due solely to our taxable REIT
    subsidiaries as a direct result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition.
    See “Note 12 — Income Taxes” of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Discontinued
    Operations

Discontinued operations for 2009 includes a $66.8 million
    net gain on the sale of fourteen assets sold during the year and
    a lease termination fee of $2.3 million related to these
    assets. Discontinued operations for 2008 includes a
    $39.0 million gain on the sale of twelve assets sold during
    the year and a lease termination fee of $1.6 million
    related to these assets. See “Note 5 —
    Dispositions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Net
    Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax
    primarily represents Sunrise’s share of net income from its
    ownership percentage in 60 and 61 of our seniors housing
    communities during 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures

We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most
    appropriate earnings measurement. However, we consider certain
    non-GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures
    of our operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is
    generally defined as one that purports to measure historical or
    future financial performance, financial position or cash flows,
    but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted
    in the most comparable GAAP measure. Set forth below are
    descriptions of the non-GAAP financial measures we consider
    relevant to our business and useful to investors, as well as
    reconciliations of these measures to our most directly
    comparable GAAP financial measures.

The non-GAAP financial measures we present herein are not
    necessarily identical to those presented by other real estate
    companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use
    the same definitions. These measures should not be considered as
    alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP)
    as indicators of our financial performance or as alternatives to
    cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance
    with GAAP) as measures of our liquidity, nor are these measures
    necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of
    our needs. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear
    understanding of our consolidated historical operating results,
    these measures should be examined in conjunction with net income
    as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and data
    included elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



Funds
    From Operations and Normalized Funds From
    Operations

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly
    assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes
    predictably over time. Since real estate values, instead, have
    historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many
    industry investors have considered presentations of operating
    results for real estate companies that use historical cost
    accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this
    problem, we consider Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and
    normalized FFO appropriate measures of operating performance of
    an equity REIT. Moreover, we believe that normalized FFO
    provides useful information because it allows investors,
    analysts and our management to compare our operating performance
    to the operating performance of other real estate companies and
    between periods on a consistent basis without having to account
    for differences caused by unanticipated items. We use the
    National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts
    (“NAREIT”) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as
    net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains
    (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate
    depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
    unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for
    unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be
    calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We define
    normalized FFO as FFO excluding the following items (which may
    be recurring in nature): (a) gains and losses on the sales
    of real property assets; (b) merger-related costs and
    expenses, including amortization of intangibles and transition
    and integration expenses, and deal costs and expenses, including
    expenses and recoveries, if any, relating to our lawsuit against
    HCP and the issuance of preferred stock or bridge loan fees;
    (c) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment
    and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred
    financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts,
    make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result
    of early retirement or payment of our debt; (d) the
    non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses; (e) the
    impact of future unannounced acquisitions or divestitures
    (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital
    transactions; (f) the reversal or incurrence of contingent
    liabilities; (g) gains and losses for non-operational
    foreign currency hedge agreements; and (h) one-time
    expenses in connection with the Kindred rent reset process.

Our FFO and normalized FFO for the five years ended
    December 31, 2010 are summarized in the following table.
    The increase in our FFO for the year ended December 31,
    2010 over the prior year can be attributed primarily to rental
    increases from our

triple-net

leased portfolio, higher NOI at our senior living operations
    portfolio due primarily to increased occupancy and higher
    average daily rates, and higher NOI at



our MOB operating portfolio due primarily to our Lillibridge
    acquisition, partially offset by higher general, administrative
    and professional fees due primarily to our Lillibridge
    acquisition.

Adjusted
    EBITDA

We consider Adjusted EBITDA an important supplemental measure to
    net income because it provides additional information with which
    to evaluate the performance of our operations and serves as
    another indication of our ability to service debt. We define
    Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
    and amortization (including non-cash stock-based compensation),
    excluding merger-related expenses and deal costs, gains and
    losses on real estate disposals and asset impairments

and/or

valuation allowances (including amounts in discontinued
    operations). The following is a reconciliation of Adjusted



EBITDA to net income (including amounts in discontinued
    operations) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and

NOI

We consider NOI an important supplemental measure to net income
    because it allows investors, analysts and our management to
    measure unlevered property-level operating results and to
    compare our operating results to the operating results of other
    real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis.
    We define NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income,
    property-level operating expenses and MOB services costs
    (including amounts in discontinued operations). The following is
    a reconciliation of NOI to total revenues (including amounts in
    discontinued operations) for the years ended December 31,

Asset/Liability
    Management

Asset/liability management is a key element of our overall risk
    management program. The objective of asset/liability management
    is to support the achievement of our business strategies while
    maintaining appropriate risk levels. The asset/liability
    management process focuses on a variety of risks, including
    market risk (primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency
    exchange risk) and credit risk. Effective management of these
    risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and
    variability of our FFO and net worth. The following discussion
    addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities,
    including the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not
    use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.



Market
    Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest
    rates on borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit
    facilities, certain of our mortgage loans that are floating rate
    obligations, mortgage loans receivable and marketable debt
    securities. These market risks result primarily from changes in
    U.S. or Canadian LIBOR rates, the Canadian Bankers’
    Acceptance rate or the U.S. or Canadian Prime rates. We
    continuously monitor our level of floating rate debt with
    respect to total debt and other factors, including our
    assessment of the current and future economic environment.

Interest rate fluctuations generally do not affect our fixed
    rate debt obligations until they mature. However, changes in
    interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt. If
    interest rates have risen at the time our fixed rate debt
    matures or is refinanced, our future earnings and cash flows
    could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs.
    Conversely, lower interest rates at the time of maturity or
    refinancing may lower our overall borrowing costs.

To highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes
    in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a
    hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points (BPS)
    in interest rates as of December 31, 2010 and 2009:

The decrease in our outstanding variable rate debt from
    December 31, 2009 is primarily attributable to mortgage
    repayments, partially offset by additional borrowings under our
    unsecured revolving credit facilities. Pursuant to the terms of
    certain leases with one of our tenants, if interest rates
    increase on certain debt that we have totaling
    $80.0 million as of December 31, 2010, our tenant is
    required to pay us additional rent (on a

dollar-for-dollar

basis) in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense
    resulting from the increased interest rates. Therefore, the
    increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally
    offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the
    tenant. Assuming a 100 basis point increase in the weighted
    average interest rate related to our variable rate debt, and
    assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of
    December 31, 2010, interest expense for 2011 would increase
    and our net income would decrease by approximately
    $1.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted common share. The fair
    value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current
    interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings.

We earn interest from investments in marketable debt securities
    on a fixed rate basis. We record these investments as

available-for-sale

at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded
    as a component of stockholders’ equity. Interest rate
    fluctuations and market conditions will cause the fair value of
    these investments to change. As of December 31, 2010 and
    2009, the fair value of our marketable debt securities, which
    had an original cost of $58.7 million and
    $58.7 million, respectively, was $66.7 million and
    $65.0 million, respectively.



As of December 31, 2010, the fair value of our loans
    receivable was $155.4 million and was based on our
    estimates of currently prevailing rates for comparable loans.
    See “Note 6 — Loans Receivable” and
    “Note 10 — Fair Values of Financial
    Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We are subject to fluctuations in U.S. and Canadian
    exchange rates which may, from time to time, have an impact on
    our financial condition and results of operations. Increases or
    decreases in the value of the Canadian dollar will impact the
    amount of net income we earn from our senior living operations
    in Canada. Based on 2010 results, if the Canadian dollar
    exchange rate were to increase or decrease by $0.10, our results
    from operations would decrease or increase, as applicable, by
    less than $0.01 million per year. If we increase our
    international presence through investments in,

and/or

acquisitions or development of, seniors housing

and/or

healthcare assets outside the United States, we may also decide
    to transact additional business in currencies other than
    U.S. or Canadian dollars. Although we may decide to pursue
    hedging alternatives (including additional borrowings in local
    currencies) to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we
    cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
    results of operations and liquidity, on our ability to service
    our indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our
    stockholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a
    REIT (a “Material Adverse Effect”).

Concentration
    and Credit Risk

We use concentration ratios to understand the potential risks of
    economic downturns involving our various asset types, geographic
    locations or tenants, operators or managers. We evaluate our
    concentration risk in terms of investment mix and operations
    mix. Investment mix measures the portion of our investments
    related to certain asset types or tenants, operators or
    managers. Operations mix measures the portion of our operating
    results attributable to certain tenants, operators or managers
    or geographic locations. The following tables reflect our
    concentration risk as of the dates and for the periods presented:

See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional disclosure and reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA
    and NOI to our net income, as computed in accordance with GAAP.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue by leasing our
    assets under long-term

triple-net

leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual
    escalators, subject to certain limitations. Some of our

triple-net

lease escalators are tied to the Consumer Price Index, with
    caps, floors or collars. We also earn revenue from individual
    residents at our seniors housing communities managed by
    independent third parties, such as Sunrise, and tenants in our
    MOBs. For the year ended December 31, 2010, 28.6% of our
    Adjusted EBITDA was derived from our senior living operations
    managed by Sunrise and MOB operations, where rental rates may
    fluctuate upon lease rollovers and renewals due to economic or
    market conditions.

Our reliance on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living for a
    significant portion of our revenues and operating income creates
    credit risk. Kindred’s and Brookdale Senior Living’s
    financial condition and ability to meet their rental payments
    and other obligations to us have a significant impact on our
    results of operations



and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. In
    addition, any failure by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to
    effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve
    our properties could adversely affect its business reputation or
    its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our
    properties, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.
    See “Risk Factors — Risks Arising from Our
    Business — We depend on Kindred and Brookdale Senior
    Living for a significant portion of our revenues and operating
    income; Any inability or unwillingness by Kindred or Brookdale
    Senior Living to satisfy its obligations under its agreements
    with us could have a Material Adverse Effect on us”
    included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and “Note 3 — Concentration of Credit
    Risk” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We regularly monitor the credit risk under our lease and other
    agreements with our tenants and borrowers by, among other
    things, (i) reviewing and analyzing information regarding
    the healthcare industry generally, publicly available
    information regarding tenants, and information provided by the
    tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements, and
    (ii) having periodic discussions with tenants, borrowers
    and their representatives.

Sunrise currently provides comprehensive property management and
    accounting services with respect to 79 of our seniors housing
    communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. Each
    management agreement has a term of 30 years from its
    effective date, the earliest of which began in 2004. Pursuant to
    the management agreements, we pay Sunrise a base management fee
    equal to a specified percentage of resident fees and similar
    revenues, subject to reduction based on below target performance
    relating to NOI for a pool of properties. For our
    79 Sunrise-managed communities, we paid management fees of
    5% for the period from January 1, 2010 through
    March 31, 2010 and 3.5% for the period from April 1,
    2010 through December 31, 2010. For 2011, in accordance
    with the management agreements, as modified in December 2010, we
    will pay management fees of 3.75% of resident fees and similar
    revenues, and thereafter we will pay base management fees of 6%
    of resident fees and similar revenues (with a range of 5% to
    7%). After 2011, we will also be obligated to pay incentive
    management fees if the properties exceed aggregate performance
    targets relating to NOI; provided, however, that total
    management fees, including incentive fees, shall not exceed 7%
    of resident fees and similar revenues. The management agreements
    also specify that we will reimburse Sunrise for direct or
    indirect costs necessary to manage our seniors housing
    communities.

We may terminate our management agreements upon the occurrence
    of an event of default by Sunrise in the performance of a
    material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain
    circumstances, the revocation of any licenses or certificates
    necessary for operation), subject in most cases to
    Sunrise’s rights to cure such defaults. Each management
    agreement may also be terminated upon the occurrence of certain
    insolvency events relating to Sunrise. In addition, the
    management agreements provide for termination rights if
    performance falls below specified NOI targets or if Sunrise
    fails to comply with certain expense-control covenants. However,
    various legal and contractual considerations may limit or delay
    our exercise of any or all of these termination rights.

We acquired Sunrise’s noncontrolling interests in our joint
    ventures with Sunrise in December 2010 and now own 100% of our
    79 Sunrise-managed communities. See
    “Note 4 — Acquisitions of Real Estate
    Property” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

See “Risk Factors — Risks Arising from Our
    Business — The properties managed by Sunrise account
    for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income;
    Adverse developments in Sunrise’s business and affairs or
    financial condition could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    us” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Lease
    Expirations

We are exposed to the risk that, as our

triple-net

leases expire, our tenants may elect not to renew those leases
    and, in that event, we may be unable to reposition the
    applicable properties on a timely basis or on as



favorable terms, if at all. The following table summarizes our

triple-net

lease expirations scheduled to occur over the next ten years:

    operators, and we may be subject to delays, limitations and
    expenses in repositioning our assets” included in
    Part I, Item IA of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

During 2010, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds
    from issuances of debt, cash flows from operations, proceeds
    from dispositions, proceeds from repayments of loans receivable,
    borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and
    cash on hand. During the next twelve months, our principal
    liquidity needs are to: (i) fund normal operating expenses;
    (ii) meet our debt service requirements; (iii) repay
    maturing mortgage and other debt, including our convertible
    notes; (iv) fund capital expenditures for our senior living
    operations and our MOB operations; (v) fund acquisitions,
    including our pending Atria transaction, investments

and/or

commitments, including development activities; and
    (vi) make distributions to our stockholders, as required
    for us to continue to qualify as a REIT. Except as discussed
    below, we believe that these needs will be satisfied by cash
    flows from operations, cash on hand, debt financings, issuance
    of equity securities, proceeds from sales of assets and
    borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities.
    However, if these sources of capital are not available

and/or

if we
    make significant acquisitions and investments, we may be
    required to obtain funding from additional borrowings, assume
    debt from the seller, dispose of assets (in whole or in part
    through joint venture arrangements with third parties)

and/or

issue
    secured or unsecured long-term debt or other securities. We
    expect to fund the Atria transaction through the issuance of
    24.96 million shares of our common stock, cash on
    hand, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities
    and assumed mortgage financing. See “Risk
    Factors — Risks Arising from Our Capital
    Structure — Limitations on our ability to access
    capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our
    debt payments, make distributions to our stockholders or make
    future investments necessary to implement our business
    plan” included in Part  I, Item 1A of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

As of December 31, 2010, we had a total of
    $21.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents,
    operating cash and cash related to our senior living operations
    and MOB operations that is deposited and held in property-level
    accounts. Funds maintained in the property-level accounts are
    used primarily for the payment of property-level expenses and
    certain capital expenditures. At December 31, 2010, we also
    had escrow deposits and restricted cash of $38.9 million
    and $956.8 million of unused borrowing capacity available
    under our unsecured revolving credit facilities.



Unsecured
    Revolving Credit Facilities

At December 31, 2010, our aggregate borrowing capacity
    under the unsecured revolving credit facilities was
    $1.0 billion, all of which matures on April 26, 2012.
    Borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities bear
    interest at a fluctuating rate per annum (based on U.S. or
    Canadian LIBOR, the Canadian Bankers’ Acceptance rate, or
    the U.S. or Canadian Prime rate), plus an applicable
    percentage based on our consolidated leverage. At
    December 31, 2010, the applicable percentage was 2.80%. Our
    unsecured revolving credit facilities also have a 20 basis
    point facility fee.

In October 2010, we amended the terms of our unsecured revolving
    credit facilities to release the subsidiary guarantees
    thereunder.

The agreements governing our unsecured revolving credit
    facilities subject us to a number of restrictive covenants. See
    “Note 9 — Borrowing Arrangements” of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Convertible
    Senior Notes

As of December 31, 2010, we had $230.0 million
    aggregate principal amount of our 3% Convertible Senior
    Notes due 2011 outstanding. The convertible notes are
    convertible at the option of the holder (i) prior to
    September 15, 2011, upon the occurrence of specified events
    and (ii) on or after September 15, 2011, at any time
    prior to the close of business on the second business day prior
    to the stated maturity (December 1, 2011), in each case
    into cash up to the principal amount of the convertible notes
    and cash or shares of our common stock, at our election, in
    respect of any conversion value in excess of the principal
    amount at the current conversion rate of 23.2133 shares per
    $1,000 principal amount of notes (which equates to a current
    conversion price of approximately $43.08 per share). The
    conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain
    circumstances, including the payment of a quarterly dividend in
    excess of $0.395 per share. To the extent the market price of
    our common stock exceeds the conversion price our earnings per
    share will be diluted.

In September 2010, the subsidiary guarantees on our outstanding
    convertible notes (other than the guarantee by Ventas Realty)
    were released pursuant to the terms of the indentures governing
    the notes.

The indenture governing the convertible notes subjects us to a
    number of restrictive covenants. See
    “Note 9 — Borrowing Arrangements”
    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Senior
    Notes and Other

As of December 31, 2010, the following series of senior
    notes issued by our subsidiaries, Ventas Realty and Ventas
    Capital Corporation, were outstanding:

•

$82.4 million principal amount of 9% senior notes due
    2012;

•

$400.0 million principal amount of 3.125% senior notes
    due 2015;

•

$400.0 million principal amount of


/


%
    senior notes due 2016; and

•

$225.0 million principal amount of


/


% senior
    notes due 2017.

In May 2010, we repaid in full, at par, $1.4 million
    principal amount then outstanding of our


/


% senior
    notes due 2010 upon maturity. In June 2010, we exercised our
    option to redeem all $142.7 million principal amount then
    outstanding of our


/


% senior
    notes due 2015, at a redemption price equal to 103.56% of par,
    plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date,
    pursuant to the call option contained in the indenture governing
    the notes. As a result, we paid a total of $147.8 million,
    plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the redemption date and
    recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of
    $6.4 million during the second quarter of 2010.

In October 2010, we exercised our option to redeem all
    $71.7 million principal amount then outstanding of our


/


% senior
    notes due 2014, at a redemption price equal to 102.21% of par,
    plus accrued and unpaid



interest to the redemption date, pursuant to the call option
    contained in the indenture governing the notes. As a result, we
    paid a total of $73.3 million, plus accrued and unpaid
    interest, on the redemption date and recognized a loss on
    extinguishment of debt of $2.5 million during the fourth
    quarter of 2010.

In September 2010, the subsidiary guarantees on our outstanding
    senior notes (other than our 9% senior notes due
    2012) were released pursuant to the terms of the indentures
    governing the notes.

In November 2010, we issued and sold $400.0 million
    aggregate principal amount of our 3.125% senior notes due
    2015, at a public offering price equal to 99.528% of par, for
    total proceeds of $398.1 million, before the underwriting
    discount and expenses.

During 2009, we issued and sold $200.0 million aggregate
    principal amount of our


/


%
    senior notes due 2016 at a


/


%
    discount to par value for total proceeds of $168.5 million,
    before the underwriting discount and expenses. We also repaid in
    full, at par, $49.8 million principal amount then
    outstanding of our


/


% senior
    notes due 2009 upon maturity and purchased in open market
    transactions

and/or

through cash tender offers $361.6 million of our senior
    notes composed of: $121.6 million principal amount then
    outstanding of our


/


% senior
    notes due 2010; $109.4 million principal amount then
    outstanding of our 9% senior notes due 2012;
    $103.3 million principal amount then outstanding of our


/


% senior
    notes due 2014; and $27.3 million principal amount then
    outstanding of our


/


% senior
    notes due 2015. We recognized a net loss on extinguishment of
    debt of $6.1 million related to these purchases.

We may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase additional
    amounts of our outstanding senior notes for cash

and/or

in
    exchange for equity securities in open market purchases,
    privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases
    or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market
    conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual
    restrictions, prospects for future access to capital and other
    factors. The amounts involved may be material.

The indentures governing our outstanding senior notes subject us
    to a number of restrictive covenants. However, at any time we
    maintain investment grade ratings by both Moody’s Investor
    Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services,
    the indentures governing our 2012, 2016 and 2017 senior notes
    provide that certain of these restrictive covenants will either
    be suspended or fall away. See “Note 9 —
    Borrowing Arrangements” of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

In September 2010, we entered into a $200.0 million
    three-year unsecured term loan with Bank of America, N.A., as
    lender. The term loan is

non-amortizing

and bears interest at an all-in fixed rate of 4% per annum. The
    term loan contains the same restrictive covenants as our
    unsecured revolving credit facilities.

Mortgage
    Loan Obligations

Total facility-level mortgage debt outstanding was approximately
    $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

In June 2010, we repaid $49.8 million of mortgage loans on
    two of our Sunrise-managed properties in which we previously had
    80% ownership interests. In connection with our payment of
    Sunrise’s share ($9.9 million) of those mortgage
    loans, we acquired Sunrise’s 20% noncontrolling interests
    in the properties.

In July 2010, in connection with our acquisition of Lillibridge
    and its related entities, we assumed $79.5 million of
    mortgage debt. See “Note 4 — Acquisitions of
    Real Estate Property” of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

During 2009, we closed a pool of seventeen first mortgage loans
    through a government-sponsored entity aggregating
    $132.1 million principal amount. These loans, which are
    secured by seventeen of our seniors housing communities, mature
    in July 2019 and bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate
    of 6.68% per annum. We also closed a first mortgage loan through
    a government-sponsored entity in the original principal amount
    of $40.5 million. This loan is secured by one seniors
    housing community, matures in November 2014 and bears interest
    at a fixed rate of 5.14% per annum.



Dividends

In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must make annual
    distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of REIT
    taxable income (excluding net capital gain). Our quarterly
    dividends in 2010 aggregated $2.14 per share, which exceeds 100%
    of our 2010 estimated taxable income. We also intend to pay
    dividends greater than 100% of taxable income for 2011. On
    February 16, 2011, our Board of Directors declared the
    first quarter 2011 dividend of $0.575 per share, payable in cash
    on March 31, 2011 to holders of record on March 11,
    2011.

We expect that REIT taxable income will be less than cash flow
    due to the allowance of depreciation and other non-cash
    deductions in computing REIT taxable income. Although we
    anticipate that we generally will be able to satisfy the 90%
    distribution requirement, from time to time, we may not have
    sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to meet this
    requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such
    greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise
    taxation. If we do not have sufficient cash on hand or other
    liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution
    requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow
    funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock
    dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities
    or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the
    REIT distribution requirements or any combination of the
    foregoing. See “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
    Considerations — Requirements for Qualification as a
    REIT— Annual Distribution Requirements” included
    in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Capital
    Expenditures

Our tenants generally bear the responsibility of maintaining and
    improving our

triple-net

leased properties. Accordingly, we do not expect to incur any
    major capital expenditures in connection with these properties.
    After the terms of the

triple-net

leases expire, or in the event that the tenants are unable or
    unwilling to meet their obligations under those leases, we
    anticipate funding any capital expenditures for which we may
    become responsible by cash flows from operations or through
    additional borrowings. With respect to our senior living and MOB
    operations, we expect that capital expenditures will be funded
    by the cash flows from the properties or through additional
    borrowings. To the extent that unanticipated expenditures or
    significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be
    affected adversely. Our ability to borrow additional funds may
    be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of the
    instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness. Our ability
    to borrow may also be limited by our lenders’ ability and
    willingness to fund, in whole or in part, borrowing requests
    under our unsecured revolving credit facilities.

Equity
    Offerings

In February 2011, we completed the sale of 5,563,000 shares
    of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant
    to our existing shelf registration statement. We received
    $300.0 million in aggregate proceeds from the sale, which
    we intend to use to repay existing mortgage debt and for working
    capital and other general corporate purposes, including to fund
    future acquisitions or investments, if any.

In March 2010, we filed a registration statement on

Form S-3

with the SEC relating to the resale, from time to time, by the
    selling stockholders of shares of our common stock, if any, that
    may become issuable upon conversion of our outstanding


/


%
    convertible senior notes due 2011. The registration statement
    replaced our previous resale shelf registration statement, which
    expired pursuant to the SEC’s rules.

In April 2009, we completed the sale of 13,062,500 shares
    of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant
    to the shelf registration statement. We received
    $312.2 million in aggregate proceeds from the sale, which
    we used, together with our net proceeds from the sale of the
    senior notes due 2016, to fund our cash tender offers for our
    outstanding senior notes, to repay debt and for general
    corporate purposes.

In April 2009, we filed an automatic shelf registration
    statement on

Form S-3

with the SEC relating to the sale, from time to time, of an
    indeterminate amount of debt securities and related guarantees,
    common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants.
    The registration statement replaced our previous automatic shelf
    registration statement, which expired pursuant to the SEC’s
    rules.



Other

We received proceeds of $11.1 million and $2.2 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, from the exercises of outstanding stock options.
    Future proceeds from the exercises of stock options will be
    primarily affected by the future performance of our stock price
    and the number of options outstanding. Options outstanding have
    increased to 1.7 million as of December 31, 2010, from
    1.6 million as of December 31, 2009. The average
    weighted exercise price was $38.12 as of December 31, 2010.

We issued approximately 41,600 and 20,800 shares of common
    stock under our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
    Plan, for net proceeds of $2.1 million and
    $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively. We currently offer a 1% discount on the
    purchase price of our stock to shareholders who reinvest their
    dividends

and/or

make
    optional cash purchases of common stock through the plan. Each
    month or quarter, as applicable, we may lower or eliminate the
    discount without prior notice, thereby affecting the future
    proceeds that we receive from this plan.

    Flows from Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities increased in 2010 primarily
    due to increases in FFO, as previously discussed, partially
    offset by a net decrease in working capital.

Cash
    Flows from Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities during 2010 and 2009 consisted
    primarily of our investments in real estate ($274.4 million
    and $45.7 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively), purchase
    of noncontrolling interests ($42.3 million in 2010),
    investments in loans receivable ($38.7 million and
    $13.8 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively),
    contributions to unconsolidated entities ($4.7 million in
    2010) and capital expenditures ($19.9 million and
    $13.8 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively). These uses
    were partially offset by proceeds from real estate disposals
    ($58.2 million and $58.5 million in 2010 and 2009,
    respectively), proceeds from loans receivable
    ($19.3 million and $8.0 million in 2010 and 2009,
    respectively) and proceeds from the sale of investments
    ($5.0 million in 2009).

Cash
    Flows from Financing Activities

Cash used in financing activities during 2010 consisted
    primarily of $524.8 million of debt repayments,
    $336.1 million of cash dividend payments to common
    stockholders, $8.1 million of distributions to
    noncontrolling interests and $2.7 million of payments for
    deferred financing costs. These uses were partially offset by
    $597.4 million of proceeds from the issuance of debt and
    $28.6 million of net borrowings under our unsecured
    revolving credit facilities.



Cash used in financing activities during 2009 consisted
    primarily of $525.2 million of debt repayments,
    $314.4 million of cash dividend payments to common
    stockholders, $292.9 million of net payments made on our
    unsecured revolving credit facilities, $9.9 million of
    distributions to noncontrolling interests and $16.7 million
    of payments for deferred financing costs. These uses were
    partially offset by $365.7 million of proceeds from the
    issuance of debt and $299.2 million of proceeds from the
    issuance of common stock.

MANAGEMENT
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Ventas, Inc. (the “Company”) is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting, as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
    Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on the framework established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management has
    determined that the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 was effective.

On July 1, 2010, the Company acquired Lillibridge
    Healthcare Services, Inc. (together with its related entities,
    “Lillibridge”). As permitted under Securities and
    Exchange Commission guidelines, the Company excluded from the
    assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, internal
    control over financial reporting of the Lillibridge assets and
    operations. Net assets and total revenues related to Lillibridge
    represented 12.2% and 3.5%, respectively, of the Company’s
    related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for
    the year ended December 31, 2010.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been
    audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
    included herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Stockholders and Board of Directors

Ventas, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Ventas, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the
    related consolidated statements of income, equity, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the accompanying index to the
    financial statements and schedule. These financial statements
    and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Ventas, Inc. at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly in all material respects the information set
    forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Ventas Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
    report dated February 18, 2011 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Stockholders and Board of Directors

Ventas, Inc.

We have audited Ventas, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Ventas, Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management Report on Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment
    of and conclusions on the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting did not include internal control over
    financial reporting of the Lillibridge assets and operations,
    which are included in the 2010 consolidated financial statements
    of Ventas, Inc. and constituted 12.2% and 3.5% of net assets and
    total revenues, respectively, of the Company’s related
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. Our audit of internal control over
    financial reporting of Ventas, Inc. also did not include an
    evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of
    the Lillibridge assets and operations.

In our opinion, Ventas, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    2010 consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule of Ventas, Inc. and our report dated February 18,
    2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 —

Description
    of Business

Ventas, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless otherwise
    indicated or except where the context otherwise requires,
    “we,” “us” or “our”) is a real
    estate investment trust (“REIT”) with a geographically
    diverse portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare properties
    in the United States and Canada. As of December 31, 2010,
    our portfolio consisted of 602 assets: 240 seniors housing
    communities, 187 skilled nursing facilities, 40 hospitals and
    135 medical office buildings (“MOBs”) and other
    properties in 43 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and
    two Canadian provinces. With the exception of our seniors
    housing communities that are managed by independent third
    parties, such as Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (together with its
    subsidiaries, “Sunrise”), pursuant to long-term
    management agreements and certain of our MOBs, including those
    acquired in connection with our Lillibridge Healthcare Services,
    Inc. (“Lillibridge”) acquisition (see
    “Note 4 — Acquisitions of Real Estate
    Property”), we lease our properties to healthcare operating
    companies under

“triple-net”

or “absolute net” leases, which require the tenants to
    pay all property-related expenses. Kindred Healthcare, Inc.
    (together with its subsidiaries, “Kindred”) leased 197
    of our properties and Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (together
    with its subsidiaries, which include Brookdale Living
    Communities, Inc. (“Brookdale”) and Alterra Healthcare
    Corporation (“Alterra”), “Brookdale Senior
    Living”) leased 79 of our properties as of
    December 31, 2010. We also had real estate loan and other
    investments relating to seniors housing and healthcare companies
    or properties as of December 31, 2010.

Our primary business consists of acquiring, financing and owning
    seniors housing and healthcare properties and leasing those
    properties to third parties or operating those properties
    through independent third party managers. Through our
    Lillibridge subsidiary, we also provide management, leasing,
    marketing, facility development and advisory services to highly
    rated hospitals and health systems throughout the United States.

Note 2 —

Accounting
    Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include our
    accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and
    the joint venture entities over which we exercise control. All
    intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
    consolidation, and net earnings are reduced by the portion of
    net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.

We apply FASB guidance for arrangements with variable interest
    entities (“VIEs”), which requires us to identify
    entities for which control is achieved through means other than
    voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the
    primary beneficiary of the VIE. A VIE is broadly defined as an
    entity with one or more of the following characteristics:
    (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to
    finance the entity’s activities without additional
    subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders
    of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to
    make decisions about the entity’s activities through voting
    or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the
    expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to
    receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or
    (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not
    proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all
    of the entity’s activities either involve, or are conducted
    on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting
    rights. We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are
    determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. We may
    change our original assessment of a VIE due to events such as
    the modification of contractual arrangements that affects the
    characteristics or adequacy of the entity’s equity
    investments at risk and the disposal of all or a portion of an
    interest held by the primary beneficiary. We identify the
    primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both of
    the following characteristics: (i) the power to direct the
    activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the
    entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation
    to absorb losses or receive benefits of the VIE that could
    potentially be significant to the entity. We perform this
    analysis on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2010, we did
    not have any unconsolidated VIEs.



VENTAS,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

We also apply FASB guidance related to investments in joint
    ventures based on the type of rights held by the limited
    partner(s) which may preclude consolidation by the sole general
    partner in certain circumstances in which the general partner
    would otherwise consolidate the joint venture. The assessment of
    limited partners’ rights and their impact on the
    presumption of control of the limited partnership by the sole
    general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole
    general partner and should be reassessed if (i) there is a
    change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of
    the limited partners, (ii) the sole general partner
    increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership
    interests, or (iii) there is an increase or decrease in the
    number of outstanding limited partnership interests. This
    guidance is also applied to managing member interests in limited
    liability companies.

On January 1, 2009, we adopted FASB guidance that requires
    minority interests to be characterized as noncontrolling
    interests and classified as a component of consolidated equity.
    The calculation of income and earnings per share continues to be
    based on income amounts attributable to the parent and is
    characterized as net income attributable to common stockholders.
    As the ownership of a controlled subsidiary increases or
    decreases, any difference between the consideration paid and the
    adjustment to the noncontrolling interest balance must be
    recorded as a component of equity in additional paid-in capital,
    so long as we maintain a controlling ownership interest. As
    required, all prior year amounts have been reclassified to
    reflect our adoption of this guidance.

On January 1, 2010, we adopted FASB guidance that provides
    additional clarification regarding

decrease-in-ownership

provisions and expands the disclosures required upon
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The adoption did not impact our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investments
    in Unconsolidated Entities

We report investments in unconsolidated entities over whose
    operating and financial policies we have the ability to exercise
    significant influence under the equity method of accounting.
    Under this method of accounting, our share of the
    investee’s earnings or losses is included in our
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

The initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated
    entities is based on the fair value of the assets at the time we
    acquired the joint venture interest. To the extent our cost
    basis differs from the basis reflected at the joint venture
    level, we generally amortize the difference over the lives of
    the related assets and liabilities and include it in our share
    of income or loss from unconsolidated entities. Our estimated
    fair values for our equity method investments are based on
    discounted cash flow models that include all estimated cash
    inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and, where
    applicable, any estimated debt premiums or discounts. The
    capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads we use
    in these models are based upon assumptions that we believe to be
    within a reasonable range of current market rates for the
    respective investments.

Accounting
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
    requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future
    events that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
    at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Long-Lived
    Assets and Intangibles

We record investments in real estate assets at cost. We account
    for acquisitions using the purchase method and allocate the cost
    of the properties acquired among tangible and recognized
    intangible assets and liabilities based upon their estimated
    fair values as of the acquisition date. Recognized intangibles
    primarily include the



VENTAS,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

value of in place leases, acquired lease contracts, tenant and
    customer relationships, trade names/trademarks and goodwill.

We estimate the fair value of buildings on an as-if-vacant basis
    and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining
    life of the building. We determine the allocated value of other
    fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such
    value over the assets’ estimated remaining useful lives. We
    determine the value of land based on real estate tax assessed
    values in relation to the total value of the asset, on internal
    analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties
    within our portfolio or by considering the sales prices of
    similar properties in recent transactions. The fair value of
    lease intangibles, if any, reflects (i) the estimated value
    of any above

and/or

below
    market leases, determined by discounting the difference between
    the estimated current market rent and the in-place rentals, the
    resulting intangible asset or liability of which is amortized to
    revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any
    fixed rate renewal periods, (ii) the estimated value of
    in-place leases related to the cost to obtain tenants, including
    tenant allowances, tenant improvements and leasing commissions,
    and an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the
    value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a
    reasonable

lease-up

period, as if the acquired space was vacant, which is amortized
    over the remaining life of the associated lease, and
    (iii) the estimated value of any above

and/or

below
    market ground leases, determined by discounting the difference
    between the estimated market rental rate and the in-place lease
    rate, which is amortized over the remaining life of the
    associated lease. We estimate the value of tenant or other
    customer relationships acquired, if any, by considering the
    nature and extent of existing business relationships with the
    tenant or customer, growth prospects for developing new business
    with the tenant or customer, the tenant’s credit quality,
    expectations of lease renewals with the tenant, and the
    potential for significant, additional future leasing
    arrangements with the tenant and amortize that value over the
    expected life of the associated arrangements or leases, which
    includes the remaining terms of the related leases and any
    expected renewal periods. We estimate the value of trade
    names/trademarks using a royalty rate methodology and amortize
    the resulting intangible over the estimated useful life. We
    calculate the fair value of long-term debt by discounting the
    remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the
    current market rate for those borrowings, which we approximate
    based on the rate we would expect to incur to replace each
    instrument on the date of acquisition, and recognize any fair
    value adjustments related to long-term debt as effective yield
    adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument. We do not
    amortize goodwill, which is the excess of the purchase price
    paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired
    business.

Fixtures and equipment, with a net book value of
    $34.5 million and $45.7 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively, is included in net real estate
    property on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record
    depreciation on the straight-line basis, using estimated useful
    lives ranging from 20 to 50 years for buildings and
    improvements and three to ten years for fixtures and equipment.
    Depreciation is discontinued when a property is identified as

held-for-sale.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily
    consisting of our investments in real estate, for impairment
    indicators. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate
    the carrying value of the related real estate investments in
    relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying
    operations, and we adjust the net book value of leased
    properties and other long-lived assets to fair value if the sum
    of the expected future undiscounted cash flows including sales
    proceeds is less than book value. An impairment loss is
    recognized at the time we make any such determination. If
    impairment indicators arise with respect to intangible assets
    with finite useful lives, we evaluate impairment by comparing
    the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future
    undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the
    asset. If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less
    than the carrying amount of the asset, then the fair value of
    the asset is estimated. We determine the impairment expense by
    comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to
    its carrying value and recognize any shortfall from fair value
    as an expense in the current



VENTAS,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

period. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually,
    but more frequently if indicators arise. We compare the
    estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill
    has been assigned with the reporting unit’s carrying value.
    The fair values used in this evaluation of goodwill, real estate
    investments and intangibles are estimated based upon discounted
    future cash flow projections. These cash flow projections are
    based upon a number of estimates and assumptions, such as
    revenue and expense growth rates, capitalization rates and
    discount rates. We did not record any impairment charges for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Assets

Held-for-Sale

and Discontinued Operations

We classify certain long-lived assets as

held-for-sale.

Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
    their carrying amount or fair value minus cost to sell and are
    no longer depreciated. Discontinued operations is defined as a
    component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is
    deemed to be

held-for-sale

if both the operations and cash flows of the component have been
    or will be eliminated from ongoing operations as a result of the
    disposal transaction and the entity will not have any
    significant continuing involvement in the operations of the
    component after the disposal transaction. The results of
    operations and gain or loss on assets sold or

held-for-sale

are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented. Interest
    expense allocated to discontinued operations has been estimated
    based on a proportional allocation of rental income and
    identified mortgage interest, or some combination thereof.

Loans
    Receivable

Loans receivable are stated at the unpaid principal balance net
    of any deferred origination fees, purchase discounts or premiums

and/or

valuation allowances. Net deferred origination fees, which are
    comprised of loan fees collected from the borrower net of
    certain direct costs, and purchase discounts or premiums are
    amortized to income over the contractual life of the loan using
    the effective interest method, with any unamortized balances
    recognized in income immediately if the loan is repaid before
    its contractual maturity. For the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, we realized gains related to the repayments
    of various loans receivable of $1.0 million, $0 and $0,
    respectively, included in income from loans and investments on
    our Consolidated Income Statements.

We evaluate the collectibility of loans and other amounts
    receivable from third parties based on a number of factors,
    including (i) corporate and facility-level financial and
    operational reports, (ii) compliance with the financial
    covenants set forth in the applicable loan or lease agreement,
    (iii) the financial stability of the borrower or tenant and
    any guarantor, (iv) the payment history of the borrower or
    tenant, and (v) current economic conditions. Our level of
    reserves, if any, for loans and other amounts receivable from
    third parties fluctuates depending upon all of these factors. We
    record a reserve at the time it is probable that we will be
    unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual
    terms of the loan agreement, including the contractual interest
    and principal payments of the loan. At the time a reserve is
    recorded, we typically cease recognizing interest income on the
    loan. The valuation allowance for loan losses was $0 and
    $3.7 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. See “Note 6 — Loans
    Receivable.”

Cash
    Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a
    maturity date of three months or less when purchased. These
    investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.



VENTAS,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Escrow
    Deposits and Restricted Cash

Escrow deposits consist of amounts held by us or our lenders to
    provide for future real estate tax and insurance expenditures
    and tenant improvements related to our properties and
    operations. Restricted cash represents amounts paid to us for
    security deposits and other similar purposes.

Deferred
    Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs are amortized as a component of
    interest expense over the terms of the related borrowings using
    a method that approximates a level yield, and were approximately
    $19.5 million and $29.3 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively, net of accumulated amortization.
    Amortized costs of approximately $17.8 million,
    $14.6 million and $7.6 million were included in
    interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Marketable
    Debt and Equity Securities

We record marketable debt and equity securities as

available-for-sale

and classify them as a component of other assets on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. These securities are recorded at
    fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in
    stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We
    report interest income, including discount or premium
    amortization, on marketable debt securities and gains or losses
    on securities sold, which are based on the specific
    identification method, in income from loans and investments on
    our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Derivative
    Instruments

From time to time, we may use derivative instruments to protect
    our future cash flows against the risk of interest rate
    movements under our variable rate debt agreements and the risk
    of foreign currency exchange rate movements. Derivative
    instruments are reported at fair value on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. We recognize changes in the fair value of
    derivatives as adjustments to net income if the derivative does
    not qualify for hedge accounting. If the derivative is eligible
    for hedge accounting, such changes are reported in accumulated
    other comprehensive income, exclusive of ineffectiveness
    amounts, which are recognized as adjustments to net income.

Fair
    Values of Financial Instruments

Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific
    measurement, and should be determined based on the assumptions
    that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
    liability. As a basis for considering market participant
    assumptions in fair value measurements, FASB guidance
    establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between
    market participant assumptions based on market data obtained
    from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable
    inputs that are classified within levels one and two of the
    hierarchy) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about
    market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified
    within level three of the hierarchy).

Level one inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting
    entity has the ability to access. Level two inputs are inputs
    other than quoted prices included in level one that are directly
    or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level two
    inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and
    liabilities in active markets, as well as other observable
    inputs for the asset or liability, such as interest rates,
    foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at
    commonly quoted intervals. Level three inputs are unobservable
    inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on
    the reporting entity’s own assumptions, as there is little,
    if any, related market activity. In instances where the
    determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs
    from different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which
    the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest
    level input that is significant



VENTAS,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of
    the significance of a particular input to the fair value
    measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers
    factors specific to the asset or liability.

We determined the fair value of our current investments in
    marketable securities using level one inputs. Additionally, we
    determined the valuation allowance for loan losses based on
    level three inputs. See “Note 6 — Loans
    Receivable.”

The estimated fair values of tangible and intangible assets and
    liabilities recorded in connection with business combinations
    are based on level three inputs. We estimate fair values based
    on cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and/or
    capitalization rates and available market information.

We determine impairment in real estate investments, including
    intangibles and goodwill, utilizing cash flow projections that
    apply estimated revenue and expense growth rates, discount rates
    and capitalization rates, which are classified as level three
    inputs.

We use the following methods and assumptions in estimating fair
    value disclosures for financial instruments.

•

Cash and cash equivalents:

The carrying amount
    of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents reported in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates fair value due to the
    short maturity of these instruments.

•

Loans receivable:

The fair value of loans
    receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows
    using current interest rates at which similar loans with the
    same maturities would be made to borrowers with similar credit
    ratings. See “— Loans Receivable” above
    regarding valuation allowances for loan losses.

•

Marketable debt securities:

The fair value of
    marketable debt securities is estimated using quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have
    the ability to access.

•

Senior notes payable and other debt:

The fair
    value of borrowings is estimated by discounting the future cash
    flows using current interest rates at which similar borrowings
    could be made by us.

During 2010, we adopted FASB guidance that adds new requirements
    for disclosures regarding transfers into and out of levels one
    and two and separate disclosures regarding purchases, sales,
    issuances and settlements relating to level three measurements.
    The adoption did not impact our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

Certain of our leases, including the majority of our leases with
    Brookdale Senior Living and the majority of our MOB leases,
    provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. We
    recognize base rental revenues under these leases on a
    straight-line basis over the terms of the applicable lease.
    Income on our straight-line revenue is recognized when
    collectibility is reasonably assured, and in the event we
    determine that collectibility of straight-line revenue is not
    reasonably assured, we establish an allowance for estimated
    losses. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis
    results in recognized revenue exceeding cash amounts
    contractually due from our tenants during the first half of the
    term for leases that have straight-line treatment. The
    cumulative excess is included in other assets, net of
    allowances, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled
    $86.3 million and $78.4 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

Our master lease agreements with Kindred (the “Kindred
    Master Leases”) and certain of our other leases provide for
    an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue
    parameters or other substantive contingencies are met. We
    recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only
    if such parameters or contingencies are met, rather than on a
    straight-line basis over the term of the applicable lease.

We recognize income from rent, lease termination fees,
    management advisory services and all other income when all of
    the following criteria are met in accordance with the Securities
    and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) Staff Accounting
    Bulletin 104: (i) the applicable agreement has been
    fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have been
    rendered; (iii) the amount is fixed or determinable; and
    (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured.



VENTAS,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

We recognize resident fees and services, other than move-in
    fees, monthly as services are provided. We recognize move-in
    fees on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable
    lease agreement. Lease agreements with residents generally have
    a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with
    30 days’ notice.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB
    guidance requiring all share-based payments to employees,
    including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in
    our Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis
    as the requisite service periods are rendered based on their
    grant date fair values.

Gain
    on Sale of Assets

We recognize sales of assets only upon the closing of the
    transaction with the purchaser. Payments received from
    purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits and
    classified as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    We recognize gains on assets sold using the full accrual method
    upon closing when the collectibility of the sales price is
    reasonably assured, we are not obligated to perform any
    significant activities after the sale to earn the profit, we
    have received adequate initial investment from the buyer, and
    other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gains may
    be deferred in whole or in part until the sales satisfy the
    following requirements of gain recognition: (i) the profit
    is determinable, meaning that the collectability of the sales
    price is reasonably assured or the amount that will not be
    collectible can be estimated; and (ii) the earnings process
    is virtually complete, meaning that we are not obliged to
    perform any significant activities after the sale to earn the
    profit.

Federal
    Income Tax

Since we have elected to be treated as a REIT under the
    applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended (the “Code”), we make no provision for REIT
    income and expense, other than for certain unrecognized tax
    benefit items. However, we record income tax expense or benefit
    with respect to certain of our entities which are taxed as
    “taxable REIT subsidiaries” under provisions similar
    to those applicable to regular corporations.

We account for deferred income taxes using the asset and
    liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events
    that have been included in our financial statements or tax
    returns. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and
    liabilities based on the differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted
    tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
    expected to reverse. An increase or decrease in the deferred tax
    liability that results from a change in circumstances, and which
    causes us to change our judgment about expected future tax
    consequences of events, would be included in the tax provision
    when such changes occur. Deferred income taxes also reflect the
    impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A
    valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely
    than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will
    not be realized. An increase or decrease in the valuation
    allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and which
    causes us to change our judgment about the realizability of the
    related deferred tax asset, would be included in the tax
    provision when such changes occur.

Foreign
    Currency

Certain of our subsidiaries’ functional currencies are the
    local currencies of their respective countries. We translate the
    results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into
    U.S. dollars using average rates of exchange in effect
    during the period, and we translate balance sheet accounts using
    exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Resulting
    currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated
    other comprehensive

    Consolidated Balance Sheets. Transaction gains and losses are
    recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Segment
    Reporting

As of December 31, 2010, we operated through three
    reportable business segments:

triple-net

leased properties, senior living operations and MOB operations.
    Our

triple-net

leased properties segment consists of acquiring and owning
    seniors housing and healthcare properties in the United States
    and leasing those properties to healthcare operating companies
    under

“triple-net”

or

“absolute-net”

leases, which require the tenants to pay all property-related
    expenses. Our senior living operations segment consists of
    investments in seniors housing communities located in the United
    States and Canada for which we engage independent third parties,
    such as Sunrise, to manage the operations. Our MOB operations
    segment primarily consists of acquiring, owning, developing,
    leasing and managing MOBs.

On July 1, 2010, we completed the acquisition of businesses
    owned and operated by Lillibridge and its related entities and
    their real estate interests in 96 MOBs and ambulatory
    facilities. With the addition of these businesses and
    properties, we believed the segregation of our MOB operations
    into its own reporting segment would be useful in assessing the
    performance of this portion of our business in the same way that
    management intends to review our performance and make operating
    decisions. Prior to the acquisition, we operated through two
    reportable segments:

triple-net

leased properties and senior living operations. See
    “Note 19 — Segment Information.”

Business
    Combinations

On January 1, 2009, we adopted FASB guidance that requires
    the acquiring entity in a business combination to measure the
    assets acquired, liabilities assumed (including contingencies)
    and any noncontrolling interests at their fair values on the
    acquisition date. The guidance also requires that
    acquisition-related transaction costs be expensed as incurred,
    acquired research and development value be capitalized and
    acquisition-related restructuring costs be capitalized only if
    they meet certain criteria. This guidance did not have a
    material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements at the
    time of adoption. Beginning January 1, 2009, we began
    expensing acquisition-related transaction costs as incurred.
    These costs are included in merger-related expenses and deal
    costs on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the years
    ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Convertible
    Debt Instruments

On January 1, 2009, we adopted FASB guidance relating to
    convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon
    conversion. The guidance specifies that issuers of convertible
    debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion
    (including partial cash settlement) should separately account
    for the liability and equity components in a manner that will
    reflect the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate
    when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. Our
    nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time our convertible
    senior notes were issued was


/


%.
    As required, all prior year amounts have been restated to
    reflect our adoption of this guidance. Applying this guidance,
    interest expense increased and net income decreased by
    $4.2 million ($0.03 per diluted share), $3.9 million
    ($0.03 per diluted share) and $3.7 million ($0.03 per
    diluted share) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008, respectively, and total equity increased by
    $12.1 million at December 31, 2008, which includes the
    calculated equity component of $19.5 million. As of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the remaining unamortized
    liability component was $225.6 million and
    $220.9 million, respectively.

Recently
    Adopted Accounting Standards

On December 21, 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
    Update (“ASU”)

2010-29,

which impacts any public entity that enters into business
    combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate
    basis. The guidance specifies that if a public entity presents
    comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose
    revenues and earnings of the combined entity as though the
    business combination(s) that occurred during the year had
    occurred at the beginning of the prior annual period when
    preparing the pro forma financial information for both the
    current and prior reporting periods. The guidance also requires
    that pro forma disclosures be accompanied by a narrative
    description regarding the nature and amount of material,
    nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the
    business combination included in reported pro forma revenues and
    earnings. This guidance is effective for business combinations
    consummated in periods beginning after December 15, 2010.
    We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2011. We do not
    believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material
    impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

As of December 31, 2010, approximately 37.9%, 19.7% and
    13.1% of our properties, based on the gross book value of real
    estate investments, were managed or operated by Sunrise,
    Brookdale Senior Living and Kindred, respectively. Seniors
    housing communities and skilled nursing facilities constituted
    approximately 70.2% and 11.7%, respectively, of our portfolio,
    based on the gross book value of real estate investments, as of
    December 31, 2010, with the remaining properties consisting
    of hospitals, MOBs and other healthcare assets. As of
    December 31, 2010, our properties were located in
    43 states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian
    provinces, with properties in each of two U.S. states
    accounting for 10% or more of our total revenues during the year
    ended December 31, 2010. Properties in each of two states
    accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues (including
    amounts in discontinued operations related to properties

held-for-sale

at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively) for the years
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Approximately 24.2%, 26.2% and 25.5% of our total revenues and
    35.6%, 38.5% and 38.1% of our total net operating income
    (“NOI”, which is defined as total revenues, less
    interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and
    MOB services costs) (including amounts in discontinued
    operations) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively, were derived from our four Kindred Master
    Leases. Approximately 11.9%, 12.9% and 12.4% of our total
    revenues and 17.3%, 19.1% and 18.5% of our total NOI (including
    amounts in discontinued operations) for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were
    derived from our lease agreements with Brookdale Senior Living.
    Each of the Kindred Master Leases and our leases with Brookdale
    Senior Living is a

triple-net

lease pursuant to which the tenant is required to pay all
    insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repairs related
    to the properties and to comply with the terms of the mortgage
    financing documents, if any, affecting the properties.

In view of the fact that Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living
    lease a substantial portion of our

triple-net

leased properties and each contributes a significant portion of
    our total revenues and NOI, Kindred’s and Brookdale Senior
    Living’s financial condition and ability and willingness to
    satisfy their obligations under their respective leases and
    other agreements with us, and their willingness to renew those
    leases upon expiration of the terms thereof, significantly
    impact our results of operations and ability to service our
    indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. We
    cannot assure you that either Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living
    will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to
    enable it to satisfy those obligations, and any inability or
    unwillingness on its part to do so would have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition, results of
    operations and liquidity, on our ability to service our
    indebtedness and other obligations and on our ability to make
    distributions to our stockholders, as required for us to
    continue to qualify as a REIT (a “Material Adverse
    Effect”). We also cannot assure you that either Kindred or
    Brookdale Senior Living will elect to renew its leases with us
    upon expiration of the initial base terms or any renewal terms
    thereof or that, if some or all of those leases are not renewed,
    we will be able to reposition the affected properties on a
    timely basis or on the same or better terms, if at all.

For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    senior living operations managed by Sunrise accounted for
    approximately 43.4%, 44.7% and 45.4% of our total revenues and
    22.7%, 20.4% and 21.7% of our total earnings before interest,
    taxes, depreciation and amortization (including non-cash
    stock-based compensation), excluding merger-related expenses and
    deal costs, gains and losses on real estate disposals and asset
    impairments

and/or

valuation allowances (“Adjusted EBITDA”) (including
    amounts in discontinued operations), respectively.

In December 2010, we and Sunrise modified the management
    agreements with respect to our 79 seniors housing communities
    managed by Sunrise. Among other things, the modifications
    included: reduction of the management fee paid to Sunrise for
    the period from April 1, 2010 through December 31,
    2010 and for all of 2011 to 3.50% and 3.75% per annum,
    respectively, after which the annual base management fee will
    equal 6% of revenues (with a range of 5% to 7%); a cap on the
    amount of incentive management fees payable to Sunrise and
    allocated “shared services” expenses; enhanced rights
    and remedies for us in the event of a Sunrise default; and
    reallocation of the NOI performance thresholds to include a
    cushion for all 79 communities.

Unlike Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living, Sunrise does not
    lease properties from us, but rather acts as a property manager
    for 79 of our seniors housing communities. Therefore, while we
    are not directly exposed to credit risk with respect to Sunrise,
    Sunrise’s inability to efficiently and effectively manage
    our properties and to provide timely and accurate accounting
    information with respect thereto could have a Material Adverse
    Effect on us. Although we have various rights as owner under the
    Sunrise management agreements, we rely on Sunrise’s
    personnel, good faith, expertise, historical performance,
    technical resources and information systems, proprietary
    information and judgment to manage our seniors housing
    communities efficiently and effectively.

We also rely on Sunrise to set resident fees and otherwise
    operate those properties in compliance with our management
    agreements. Sunrise’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy
    its obligations under our management agreements, changes in
    Sunrise’s senior management or any adverse developments in
    Sunrise’s business and affairs or financial condition could
    have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Each of Kindred, Brookdale Senior Living and Sunrise is subject

Acquisitions
    of Real Estate Property

The following summarizes our acquisitions in 2010, 2009 and
    2008. We completed these acquisitions primarily to invest in
    additional seniors housing and healthcare properties and achieve
    an expected yield on investment, to grow and diversify our
    portfolio and revenue base and to reduce our dependence on any
    single operator, geography or asset type for our revenue.

Lillibridge
    Acquisition

On July 1, 2010, we completed the acquisition of businesses
    owned and operated by Lillibridge and its related entities and
    their real estate interests in 96 MOBs and ambulatory facilities
    for approximately $381 million, including the assumption of
    $79.5 million of mortgage debt, which was not repaid in
    connection with the closing. Lillibridge is a fully-integrated
    healthcare real estate company that owns, designs, develops and
    manages MOBs, and offers strategic, financial and operational
    real estate advisory services, principally for highly rated,

not-for-profit

hospitals and healthcare systems throughout the United States.

As a result of the transaction, we acquired: a 100% interest in
    Lillibridge’s property management, leasing, construction
    and development, advisory and asset management services
    business; a 100% interest in 38 MOBs; a 20% joint venture
    interest in 24 MOBs; and a 5% joint venture interest in 34 MOBs.
    We are the managing member of these joint ventures and the
    property manager for the joint venture properties. Two
    institutional third parties hold the controlling interests in
    these joint ventures, and we have a right of first offer on
    those interests. We funded the acquisition with cash on hand,
    borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and
    the assumption of mortgage debt. In connection with the
    acquisition, $132.7 million of mortgage debt was repaid.

Other
    2010 Acquisitions

In December 2010, we acquired Sunrise’s noncontrolling
    interests in 58 of our seniors housing communities currently
    managed by Sunrise for a total valuation of approximately
    $186 million, including assumption of Sunrise’s share
    of mortgage debt totaling $144 million. The noncontrolling
    interests acquired represented between 15% and 25% ownership
    interests in the communities, and we now own 100% of all 79 of
    our Sunrise-managed seniors housing communities. We recorded the
    difference between the consideration paid and the noncontrolling
    interest balance as a component of equity in additional paid-in
    capital.



VENTAS,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Also in December 2010, we purchased five MOBs under our
    Lillibridge platform for a purchase price of $36.6 million.
    Our portfolio now includes 158 owned or managed MOBs in 19
    U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

    Acquisitions

We purchased four MOBs for an aggregate purchase price of
    $77.7 million, including $1.7 million of
    noncontrolling interest. We own one of these MOBs through a
    consolidated joint venture with a partner that provides
    management and leasing services for the property. The purchase
    price was allocated between building and improvements, tenant
    improvements and lease intangibles of $60.9 million,
    $11.1 million and $5.7 million, respectively.
    Additionally, in 2009, we purchased one skilled nursing facility
    for $10.0 million and leased it to Brookdale Senior Living.
    The purchase price was allocated between land of
    $0.7 million and building and improvements of
    $9.3 million.

We also completed the development of two MOBs pursuant to an
    arrangement we entered into with a nationally recognized private
    developer of MOBs and healthcare facilities in 2008. That
    arrangement gave us the exclusive right, as part of a joint
    venture, to develop up to ten identified MOBs on hospital
    campuses in eight states. As of December 31, 2009, we had
    invested approximately $35.6 million, including
    $1.4 million of noncontrolling interest, in two MOBs under
    the arrangement, both of which we consolidate. The investment
    was allocated between land, building and improvements and tenant
    improvements of $1.4 million, $25.5 million and
    $8.7 million, respectively.

    Acquisitions

We acquired a

47-unit

seniors housing community located in Texas for
    $5.1 million, which we lease to an affiliate of Capital
    Senior Living Corporation. The purchase price was allocated to
    building and improvements based upon estimated fair value.

We acquired three MOBs for an aggregate purchase price of
    $66.8 million, inclusive of assumed debt of
    $34.6 million at the time of the acquisitions. The purchase
    price was allocated between land, building and improvements,
    tenant improvements and lease intangibles of $4.6 million,
    $59.1 million, $3.0 million and $0.1 million,
    respectively, based upon their estimated fair values. We own one
    of these MOBs through a consolidated joint venture, with a
    partner that provides management and leasing services for the
    property.

As of December 31, 2008, we had invested approximately
    $8.7 million in the two MOBs that were both under
    development pursuant to our exclusive joint venture arrangement
    described above.

Pending
    Acquisition

In October 2010, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire
    substantially all of the real estate assets of privately-owned
    Atria Senior Living Group, Inc. (together with its affiliates,
    “Atria”) for a total purchase price of
    $3.1 billion, comprised of $1.35 billion of our common
    stock (a fixed 24.96 million shares), $150 million in
    cash and the assumption or repayment of $1.6 billion of net
    debt. We will acquire from Atria 118 private pay seniors housing
    communities located primarily in affluent coastal markets such
    as the New York metropolitan area, New England and
    California. Atria, based in Louisville, Kentucky, is owned by
    private equity funds managed by Lazard Real Estate Partners.
    Prior to the closing, Atria will spin off its management
    company, which will continue to operate the acquired assets
    under a long-term management contract with us. We expect to
    complete the transaction in the first half of 2011, although we
    cannot assure you that the transaction will close on such
    timetable or at all.

Dispositions

We present separately, as discontinued operations, in all
    periods presented the results of operations for all assets

held-for-sale

or disposed of during the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2010.

    Dispositions

During 2010, we sold seven seniors housing communities for
    approximately $60.5 million, including lease termination
    fees of $0.7 million, and recognized a gain from these
    sales of approximately $17.3 million in 2010.

    Dispositions

In June 2009, we sold six skilled nursing facilities to Kindred
    for total consideration of $58.0 million, consisting of a
    $55.7 million aggregate sale price and a $2.3 million
    lease termination fee. The proceeds from

the sale were held in a Code Section 1031 exchange escrow
    account with a qualified intermediary and used for our
    acquisition of three MOBs in December 2009. We recognized a gain
    from the sale of these assets of $39.3 million in 2009.

During 2009, we also sold five seniors housing communities, one
    hospital, one MOB and one other property to the existing tenants
    for an aggregate sale price of $96.2 million and
    transferred related debt of $38.8 million. We recognized a
    net gain from the sales of these assets of $27.5 million in
    2009.

    Dispositions

In December 2008, we sold five seniors housing communities to
    the existing tenant for an aggregate sale price of
    $62.5 million. We realized a gain from the sale of these
    assets of $21.5 million in 2008, $8.3 million of which
    was deferred due to a $10.0 million loan we made to the
    buyer in conjunction with the sale and was initially being
    recognized over a period of three years from the date of the
    sale. However, in December 2010, the buyer repaid the loan in
    full, and we recognized the remaining gain at that time. We
    recognized $7.9 million and $0.5 million of the gain
    during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. See “Note 6 — Loans
    Receivable.”

In April 2008, we sold seven properties for an aggregate sale
    price of $69.1 million. We recognized a gain from the sale
    of these assets of $25.9 million in 2008. In addition, we
    received a lease termination fee from the tenant of
    $1.6 million.

Set forth below is a summary of the results of operations of
    properties sold during the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, all of which were included in our

triple-net

leased properties segment, with the exception of one MOB we sold
    during 2009.

Loans
    Receivable

As of December 31, 2010, we had $149.3 million of net
    loans receivable relating to seniors housing and healthcare
    companies or properties.

In June 2008, we purchased $112.5 million principal amount
    of first mortgage debt issued by a national provider of
    healthcare services, primarily skilled nursing care. We
    purchased this debt at a discount for $98.8 million,
    resulting in an effective interest rate to maturity of LIBOR
    plus 533 basis points. Interest on the loan is payable
    monthly at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 125 basis points,
    and the loan matures in January 2012, but may be extended for
    one year, at the borrower’s option, subject to certain
    conditions.



VENTAS,

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

In December 2008, we received a $10.0 million three-year
    note issued to us as partial consideration for five seniors
    housing communities we sold at that time. This note was repaid
    in full in December 2010.

In 2005, we made three first mortgage loans in the aggregate
    principal amount of $20 million. The loans originally
    accrued interest at a non-default annual rate of 9% and were
    secured by four seniors housing communities and guaranteed.
    During 2008, the borrowers defaulted on their obligations under
    the loans, and we initiated foreclosure actions on the four
    secured assets. Due to the unfavorable capital markets and
    economic environment at that time, we recorded a provision for
    loan losses on the loans of $6.0 million. Since then, we
    have taken title to all four assets through foreclosure. We sold
    one property to an affiliate of one of our existing tenants for
    approximately $6.3 million. In connection with the sale, we
    provided $5.0 million of first mortgage financing to the
    purchaser, secured by, among other things, the property, and
    received cash consideration of $1.2 million after expenses.
    We recorded no gain or loss from this transaction. The carrying
    amounts of the remaining three assets, totaling
    $9.0 million, approximated the fair value of the underlying
    assets and no gain or loss was recorded in connection with
    obtaining title. Operations from these three properties were
    consolidated into our consolidated financial statements during
    2010.

During 2009, we entered into a sourcing and services agreement
    with a third party to acquire or originate a diversified pool of
    mortgage loans secured by stable, cash flowing seniors housing
    and MOB assets. In late 2009, we acquired a first mortgage loan
    in the principal amount of $6.5 million bearing interest at
    a fixed rate of 10% per annum and maturing in 2012. During 2010,
    we acquired a first mortgage loan in the principal amount of
    $15.8 million bearing interest at a fixed rate of 6.6% per
    annum and maturing in 2017. Additionally, during 2010, we
    acquired a first mortgage loan in the principal amount of
    $20.0 million bearing interest at a fixed rate of 9.25% per
    annum and maturing in 2015.

Investments
    in Unconsolidated Entities

We report investments in unconsolidated entities over whose
    operating and financial policies we have the ability to exercise
    significant influence under the equity method of accounting. We
    serve as the managing member of each unconsolidated entity and
    provide various services in exchange for fees and
    reimbursements. Our joint venture partners have significant
    participating rights, and, therefore, we are not required to
    consolidate these entities. Additionally, these entities are not
    considered VIEs as they are viable entities controlled by equity
    holders with sufficient capital. At December 31, 2010, we
    owned interests in 58 properties which were accounted for under
    the equity method. Our net investment in these properties as of
    December 31, 2010 was $15.3 million. For the year
    ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a loss from
    unconsolidated entities of $0.7 million.

Unsecured
    Revolving Credit Facilities

We have $1.0 billion of aggregate borrowing capacity under
    our unsecured revolving credit facilities, all of which matures
    on April 26, 2012. Borrowings under our unsecured revolving
    credit facilities bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum
    (based on U.S. or Canadian LIBOR, Canadian Bankers’
    Acceptance rate, or the U.S. or Canadian Prime rate) plus
    an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage. At
    December 31, 2010, the applicable percentage was 2.80%. Our
    unsecured revolving credit facilities also have a 20 basis
    point facility fee. At December 31, 2010, we had
    $40.0 million of borrowings outstanding, $3.2 million
    of letters of credit and $956.8 million of available
    borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit
    facilities.

In October 2010, we amended the terms of our unsecured revolving
    credit facilities to release the subsidiary guarantees
    thereunder.

Convertible
    Senior Notes

As of December 31, 2010, we had $230.0 million
    aggregate principal amount of our


/


%
    convertible notes due 2011 outstanding. The convertible notes
    are convertible at the option of the holder (i) prior to
    September 15, 2011, upon the occurrence of specified events
    and (ii) on or after September 11, 2011, at any time
    prior to the close of business on the second business day prior
    to the stated maturity (December 1, 2011), in each case
    into cash up to the principal amount of the convertible notes
    and cash or shares of our common stock, at our election, in
    respect of any conversion value in excess of the principal
    amount at the current conversion rate of 23.2133 shares per
    $1,000 principal amount of notes (which equates to a conversion
    price of approximately $43.08 per share). The conversion rate is
    subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including the
    payment of a quarterly dividend in excess of $0.395 per share.
    To the extent the market price of our common stock exceeds the
    conversion price, our earnings per share will be diluted. The
    convertible notes



VENTAS,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

had a minimal dilutive impact per share for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. See “Note 14 —
    Earnings Per Share.”

Initially, the convertible notes were unconditionally
    guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis
    by Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership (“Ventas
    Realty”) and by certain of our other direct and indirect
    subsidiaries. On September 30, 2010, the subsidiary
    guarantees (other than the guarantee by Ventas Realty) were
    released pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the
    notes. The convertible notes are part of our and the
    guarantor’s general unsecured obligations, ranking equal in
    right of payment with all of our and the guarantor’s
    existing and future senior obligations and ranking senior to all
    of our and the guarantor’s existing and future subordinated
    indebtedness. However, the convertible notes are effectively
    subordinated to our and the guarantor’s secured
    indebtedness, if any, to the extent of the value of the assets
    securing that indebtedness. The convertible notes are also
    structurally subordinated to preferred equity and indebtedness,
    whether secured or unsecured, of our subsidiaries that do not
    guarantee the convertible notes.

We may not redeem the convertible notes prior to maturity except
    to the extent necessary to preserve our status as a REIT.

If we experience certain kinds of changes of control, holders
    may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their
    convertible notes for cash at a purchase price equal to 100% of
    the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased,
    plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.

Senior
    Notes and Other

As of December 31, 2010, we had $1.3 billion aggregate
    principal amount of senior notes issued by our subsidiaries,
    Ventas Realty and Ventas Capital Corporation (collectively, the
    “Issuers”) outstanding. We issued $200.0 million
    principal amount of each of our senior notes due 2016 and senior
    notes due 2017 at initial discounts to par value of


/


%
    and


/


%,
    respectively. We issued $50.0 million principal amount of
    our senior notes due 2014 at a 1% discount to par value.

In May 2010, we repaid in full, at par, $1.4 million
    principal amount then outstanding of our


/


% senior
    notes due 2010 upon maturity. In June 2010, we exercised our
    option to redeem all $142.7 million principal amount then
    outstanding of our


/


% senior
    notes due 2015, at a redemption price equal to 103.56% of par,
    plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date,
    pursuant to the call option contained in the indenture governing
    the notes. As a result, we paid a total of $147.8 million,
    plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the redemption date and
    recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of
    $6.4 million during the second quarter of 2010.

In October 2010, we exercised our option to redeem all
    $71.7 million principal amount then outstanding of our


/


% senior
    notes due 2014, at a redemption price equal to 102.21% of par,
    plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date,
    pursuant to the call option contained in the indenture governing
    the notes. As a result, we paid a total of $73.3 million,
    plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the redemption date and
    recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.5 million
    during the fourth quarter of 2010.

In November 2010, we issued and sold $400.0 million
    aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due 2015,
    at a public offering price equal to 99.528% of par for total
    proceeds of $398.1 million, before the underwriting
    discount and expenses.

During 2009, we issued and sold $200.0 million aggregate
    principal amount of senior notes due 2016 at a

    discount to par value, for total proceeds of
    $168.5 million, before the underwriting discount and

    upon maturity, and purchased in open market transactions

    outstanding

    notes due 2015. We recognized a net loss on extinguishment of
    debt of $6.1 million related to these purchases.

During 2008, we purchased $124.4 million principal amount
    of senior notes due 2009 and $52.0 million principal amount
    of senior notes due 2010 in open market transactions and
    reported a net gain on extinguishment of debt of
    $2.5 million.

Initially, the senior notes were unconditionally guaranteed,
    jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by us and,
    except in the case of our 3.125% senior notes due 2015, by
    certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. On
    September 30, 2010, the subsidiary guarantees on our
    outstanding senior notes (other than our 9% senior notes
    due 2012) were released pursuant to the terms of the
    indentures governing the notes. The senior notes are part of our
    and the Issuers’ general unsecured obligations, ranking
    equal in right of payment with all of our and the Issuers’
    existing and future senior obligations and ranking senior to all
    of our and the Issuers’ existing and future subordinated
    indebtedness. However, the senior notes are effectively
    subordinated to our and the Issuers’ secured indebtedness,
    if any, to the extent of the value of the assets securing that
    indebtedness. The senior notes are also structurally
    subordinated to the preferred equity and indebtedness, whether
    secured or unsecured, of our subsidiaries.

The Issuers may redeem each series of senior notes, in whole at
    any time or in part from time to time, prior to maturity at
    varying redemption prices set forth in the applicable indenture,
    plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the
    redemption date. In addition, at certain times, the Issuers may
    redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of each
    series of senior notes (other than our 3.125% senior notes
    due 2015) with the net cash proceeds from certain equity
    offerings at the redemption price set forth in the applicable
    indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the
    redemption date.

If we experience certain kinds of changes of control, the
    Issuers must make an offer to repurchase the senior notes (other
    than our 3.125% senior notes due 2015), in whole or in
    part, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
    amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date
    of purchase; provided, however, that in the event Moody’s
    Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
    (“S&P”) have confirmed their ratings at Ba3 or
    higher and BB- or higher on the senior notes and certain other
    conditions are met, this repurchase obligation will not apply.

In September 2010, we entered into a $200.0 million
    three-year unsecured term loan with Bank of America, N.A., as
    lender. The term loan is

non-amortizing

and bears interest at an all-in fixed rate of 4% per annum. The
    term loan contains the same restrictive covenants as our
    unsecured revolving credit facilities.

Mortgages

At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding 105 mortgage loans
    in the aggregate principal amount of $1.3 billion that are
    collateralized by 114 underlying properties. These loans
    generally bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 5.1% to 7.7%
    per annum, except for six loans having aggregate outstanding
    principal balances totaling $115.3 million which bear
    interest at the lender’s variable rates ranging from 1.2%
    to 2.6% per annum as of December 31, 2010. At
    December 31, 2010, the weighted average annual rate on our
    fixed rate mortgage loans was 6.2%, and the weighted average
    annual rate on our variable rate mortgage loans was 1.5%. Our
    mortgage loans had a weighted average maturity of 5.8 years
    as of December 31, 2010.

At December 31, 2010, we had $21.8 million of
    unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, for a net amount
    outstanding on our unsecured revolving credit facilities of
    $18.2 million.

As of December 31, 2010, our joint venture partners’
    share of total debt was $4.8 million with respect to three
    of our properties owned through consolidated joint ventures.
    Total debt does not include our portion of debt related to our
    investments in unconsolidated entities.

The instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness contain
    covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of
    our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) incur debt;
    (ii) make certain dividends, distributions and investments;
    (iii) enter into certain transactions; (iv) merge,
    consolidate or transfer certain assets; and (v) sell
    assets. At any time we maintain investment grade ratings by both
    Moody’s and S&P, the indentures governing certain

    restrictive covenants will either be suspended or fall away. We
    and our subsidiaries are also required to maintain total
    unencumbered assets of at least 150% of our unsecured debt. Our
    unsecured revolving credit facilities and term loan also require
    us to maintain certain financial covenants pertaining to, among
    other things, our consolidated leverage, secured debt, fixed
    charge coverage and net worth.

As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all of
    these covenants.

Derivatives
    and Hedging

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to the effect
    of interest rate movements on future cash flows under our
    variable rate debt obligations and the effect of foreign
    currency exchange rate movements on our senior living
    operations. We attempt to mitigate these risks by following
    established risk management policies and procedures, including
    the use of derivative instruments.

For interest rate exposures, we use derivatives primarily to fix
    the rate on our variable rate debt and to manage the cost of
    borrowing obligations. We prohibit the use of derivative
    instruments for trading or speculative purposes, and we have a
    policy of only entering into contracts with major financial
    institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors.
    When considered together with the underlying exposure that the
    derivative is designed to hedge, we do not expect that the use
    of derivatives in this manner would have any material adverse
    effect on our future net income or financial position.

Unamortized
    Fair Value Adjustment

As of December 31, 2010, the unamortized fair value
    adjustment related to the long-term debt we assumed in
    connection with our 2007 acquisition of the assets of Sunrise
    Senior Living Real Estate Investment

    adjustments over the remaining term of the instruments. The
    estimated aggregate amortization of the fair value adjustment
    related to long-term debt (reduction of interest expense) for
    each of the next five years follows: 2011 —
    $3.2 million; 2012 — $2.6 million;

Fair value estimates are subjective in nature and depend upon
    several important assumptions, including estimates of future
    cash flows, risks, discount rates and relevant comparable market
    information associated with each financial instrument. The use
    of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may
    have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value
    amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented above are not
    necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a
    current market exchange.

At December 31, 2010, we held marketable debt securities,
    classified as

available-for-sale,

with an aggregate amortized cost basis and fair value of
    $61.9 million and $66.7 million, respectively. At
    December 31, 2009, these securities had an aggregate
    amortized cost basis and fair value of $60.6 million and
    $65.0 million, respectively. The contractual maturities of
    our marketable debt securities range from October 1, 2012
    to April 15, 2016. In January 2011, we sold one of the
    securities and received proceeds of approximately
    $10.6 million. We expect to recognize a gain from the sale
    of approximately $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2011.

Compensation
    Plans

We have: four plans under which outstanding options to purchase
    common stock

and/or

shares or units of restricted stock have been, or may be,
    granted to officers, employees and non-employee directors (the
    2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan), the 2004 Stock
    Plan for Directors, the 2006 Incentive Plan, and the 2006 Stock
    Plan for Directors); one plan under which executive officers may
    receive common stock in lieu of compensation (the Executive
    Deferred Stock Compensation Plan); and two plans under which
    certain directors have received or may receive common stock in
    lieu of director fees (the Common Stock Purchase Plan for
    Directors (the “Directors Stock Purchase Plan”) and
    the Nonemployee Directors’ Deferred Stock Compensation
    Plan). These plans are referred to collectively as the
    “Plans.”

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we were permitted
    to make option and restricted stock grants and stock issuances
    only under the Executive Deferred Stock Compensation Plan, the
    Nonemployee Directors’ Deferred Stock Compensation Plan,
    the 2006 Incentive Plan and the 2006 Stock Plan for Directors.

The number of shares reserved and the number of shares available
    for future grants or issuance under these Plans as of
    December 31, 2010 are as follows:

•

Executive Deferred Stock Compensation Plan

—
    500,000 shares were reserved initially for issuance to our
    executive officers in lieu of the payment of all or a portion of
    their salary, at their option and 500,000 shares were
    available for future issuance as of December 31, 2010.

•

Nonemployee Directors’ Deferred Stock Compensation
    Plan

— 500,000 shares were reserved initially
    for issuance to nonemployee directors in lieu of the payment of
    all or a portion of their retainer and meeting fees, at their
    option, and 453,267 shares were available for future
    issuance as of December 31, 2010.

•

2006 Incentive Plan

— 5,000,000 shares
    were reserved initially for grants or issuance to employees, and
    2,597,732 shares were available for future grants or
    issuance as of December 31, 2010. This plan replaced the
    2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan).

•

2006 Stock Plan for Directors

—
    400,000 shares were reserved initially for grants or
    issuance to non-employee directors and 229,448 shares were
    available for future grants or issuance as of December 31,
    2010. This plan replaced the 2004 Stock Plan for Directors.

Under the Plans (other than the Executive Deferred Stock
    Compensation Plan, the Directors Stock Purchase Plan and the
    Nonemployee Directors’ Deferred Stock Compensation Plan),
    options are exercisable at the market price on the date of
    grant, expire ten years from the date of grant, and vest over
    periods ranging from one to five years. Vesting of certain
    options may accelerate upon a change of control of Ventas, as

Employee

    the terms of the ESPP, on each purchase date, participants may
    purchase shares of common stock at a price not less than 90% of
    the

    tax-favored portion of the plan) and not less than 95% of the
    market price on that date (with respect to the additional
    employee and director portion of the plan). We initially
    reserved 2,500,000 shares for issuance under the ESPP. As
    of December 31, 2010, 36,375 shares had been purchased
    under the ESPP and 2,463,625 shares were available for
    future issuance.

Employee
    Benefit Plan

We maintain a 401(K) plan that allows eligible employees to
    defer compensation subject to certain limitations imposed by the
    Code. We make a contribution for each qualifying employee of up
    to 3% of his or her salary, subject to certain limitations,
    regardless of the employee’s individual contribution.
    During 2010, 2009 and 2008, our aggregate contributions were
    approximately $200,000, $189,000 and $164,000, respectively.

Note 12 —

Income
    Taxes

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing
    with the year ended December 31, 1999. We have also elected
    for certain of our subsidiaries to be treated as taxable REIT
    subsidiaries (“TRS” or “TRS entities”),
    which are subject to federal and state income taxes. The TRS
    entities were created or acquired in connection with the Sunrise
    REIT and Lillibridge acquisitions. All entities other than the
    TRS entities are collectively referred to as “the
    REIT” within this Note 12.

We intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to enable
    us to qualify as a REIT; however, our actual qualification and
    taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, on a
    continuing basis, distribution levels, stock ownership, and the
    various qualification tests. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, our tax treatment of

income tax benefit included in the consolidated benefit for

Although the TRS entities were not liable for any cash federal
    income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010, their
    federal income tax liabilities may increase in future years as
    we exhaust net operating loss carryforwards and as our senior
    living operations segment grows. Such increases could be
    significant.

The REIT made no income tax payments for the year ended

In connection with the Sunrise REIT acquisition, we established
    a beginning net deferred tax liability of $306.3 million
    related to temporary differences between the financial reporting
    and tax bases of assets and liabilities acquired (primarily
    property and related assets, net of net operating loss
    carryforwards). No net deferred tax asset or liability was
    recorded for the Lillibridge acquisition.

Each TRS is a tax paying component for purposes of classifying
    deferred tax assets and liabilities. The tax effects of
    temporary differences and carryforwards included in the net
    deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2010, 2009 and

Our net deferred tax liability decreased $12.3 million

    noncontrolling interests in 58 of our seniors housing
    communities currently managed by Sunrise. See
    “Note 4 — Acquisitions of Real Estate
    Property.”

Due to our uncertainty regarding the realization of certain
    deferred tax assets, we established valuation allowances, the
    majority of which related to the net operating loss
    (“NOL”) carryforward related to the REIT.



VENTAS,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the net
    difference between tax bases and the reported amount of REIT
    assets and liabilities for federal income tax purposes was
    approximately $365.4 million and $384.7 million,
    respectively, less than the book bases of those assets and
    liabilities for financial reporting purposes.

We are subject to corporate level taxes for any asset
    dispositions during the ten-year period immediately after the
    assets were owned by a C corporation (either prior to our REIT
    election, through stock acquisition or merger) (“built-in
    gains tax”). The amount of income potentially subject to
    built-in gains tax is generally equal to the lesser of the
    excess of the fair value of the asset over its adjusted tax
    basis as of the date it became a REIT asset or the actual amount
    of gain. Some, but not all, future gains could be offset by
    available NOLs.

We had a $23.3 million deferred tax liability as of
    December 31, 2007 to be utilized for any built-in gains tax
    related to the disposition of assets owned prior to our REIT
    election in 1999. The ten-year period in which these assets were
    subject to built-in gains tax ended on December 31, 2008.
    Because we did not dispose of any of these assets prior to
    December 31, 2008, we did not expect to pay any amounts
    related to this contingent liability and therefore
    $23.3 million was reversed into income during 2008.

Generally, we are subject to audit under the statute of
    limitations by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 and subsequent years
    and are subject to audit by state taxing authorities for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 and subsequent years. We are
    also subject to audit by the Canada Revenue Agency
    (“CRA”) and provincial authorities generally for
    periods subsequent to 2004 related to entities acquired or
    formed in connection with our Sunrise REIT acquisition.

We have a combined NOL carryforward of $154 million at
    December 31, 2010 related to the TRS entities and an NOL
    carryforward related to the REIT of $110 million (including
    carryforwards related to Lillibridge entities of
    $12.5 million and $19.2 million, respectively). These
    amounts can be used to offset future taxable income (and/or
    taxable income for prior years if an audit determines that tax
    is owed), if any. The REIT will be entitled to utilize NOLs and
    tax credit carryforwards only to the extent that REIT taxable
    income exceeds our deduction for dividends paid. Lillibridge NOL
    carryforwards are limited as to their utilization by
    Section 382 of the Code. The NOL carryforwards begin to
    expire in 2024 with respect to the TRS entities and in 2020 for
    the REIT.

As a result of our uncertainty regarding the use of existing
    REIT NOLs, we have not ascribed any net deferred tax benefit to
    REIT NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
    The IRS may challenge our entitlement to these tax attributes
    during its review of the tax returns for the previous tax years.
    We believe we are entitled to these tax attributes, but we
    cannot give any assurances as to the outcome of these matters.

    unrecognized tax benefits:

    tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce our annual
    effective tax rate. We accrued no penalties. Interest of
    $0.4 million related to the unrecognized tax benefits was
    accrued during 2010. We expect our unrecognized tax benefits to
    increase by $2.5 million during 2011.

Assumption
    of Certain Operating Liabilities and Litigation

We may be subject to various liabilities arising out of our
    acquisitions, including most recently the Lillibridge
    acquisition. Some of these liabilities may be indemnified by
    third parties. If the liabilities we have assumed are greater
    than expected, if there are obligations relating to the acquired
    properties or operations of which we were not aware at the time
    of completion of the acquisitions, or if we are not indemnified,
    such liabilities

We are subject to certain operating and ground lease obligations
    that generally require fixed monthly or annual rent payments and
    may also include escalation clauses and renewal options. These
    leases have terms that expire during the next 84 years,
    excluding extension options. Our future minimum lease
    obligations under non-cancelable operating and ground leases as

Litigation

Legal
    Proceedings Defended and Indemnified by Third
    Parties

Kindred, Brookdale Senior Living, Sunrise and our other tenants,
    operators and managers are parties to certain legal actions and
    regulatory investigations arising in the normal course of their
    business. In certain cases, the tenant, operator or manager, as
    applicable, has agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless
    against these actions and investigations. However, the
    resolution of any litigation or investigations, either
    individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse
    effect on Kindred’s, Brookdale Senior Living’s,
    Sunrise’s or such other tenants’, operators’ and
    managers’ liquidity, financial condition or results of
    operations, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect
    on us.

Litigation
    Related to the Sunrise REIT Acquisition

On May 3, 2007, we filed a lawsuit against HCP, Inc.
    (“HCP”) in the United States District Court for the
    Western District of Kentucky, entitled

Ventas, Inc. v.
    HCP, Inc.

, Case

No. 07-cv-238-JGH.

We asserted claims of tortious interference with contract and
    tortious interference with prospective business advantage. Our
    complaint alleged that HCP interfered with our purchase
    agreement to acquire the assets and liabilities of Sunrise REIT
    and with the process for unitholder consideration of the
    purchase agreement. The complaint alleged, among other things,
    that HCP made certain improper and misleading public statements

and/or

offers to acquire Sunrise REIT and that HCP’s actions
    caused us to suffer substantial damages, including, among other
    things, the payment of materially greater consideration to
    acquire Sunrise REIT resulting from the substantial increase in
    the purchase price above the original contract price necessary
    to obtain unitholder approval and increased costs associated
    with the delay in closing the acquisition, including increased
    costs to finance the transaction as a result of the delay.

HCP brought counterclaims against us alleging misrepresentation
    and negligent misrepresentation by Sunrise REIT related to its
    sale process, claiming that we were responsible for those
    actions as successor. HCP sought compensatory and punitive
    damages. On March 25, 2009, the District Court granted us
    judgment on the pleadings against all counterclaims brought by
    HCP and dismissed HCP’s counterclaims with prejudice.
    Thereafter, the District Court confirmed the dismissal of
    HCP’s counterclaims.

On July 16, 2009, the District Court denied HCP’s
    summary judgment motion as to our claim for tortious
    interference with business advantage, permitting us to present
    that claim against HCP at trial. The District Court granted
    HCP’s motion for summary judgment as to our claim for
    tortious interference with contract and dismissed that claim.
    The District Court also ruled that we could not seek to recover
    a portion of our alleged damages.

On September 4, 2009, the jury unanimously held that HCP
    tortiously interfered with our business expectation to acquire
    Sunrise REIT at the agreed price by employing significantly
    wrongful means such as fraudulent misrepresentation, deceit and
    coercion. The jury awarded us $101.6 million in
    compensatory damages, which is the full amount of damages the
    District Court permitted us to seek at trial. The District Court
    entered judgment on the jury’s verdict on September 8,
    2009.

On November 16, 2009, the District Court affirmed the
    jury’s verdict and denied all of HCP’s post-trial
    motions, including a motion requesting that the District Court
    overturn the jury’s verdict and enter judgment for HCP or,
    in the alternative, award HCP a new trial. The District Court
    also denied our motion for pre-judgment interest

and/or

to
    modify the jury award to increase it to reflect the currency
    rates in effect on September 8, 2009, the date of entry of
    the judgment.

On November 17, 2009, HCP appealed the District
    Court’s judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for
    the Sixth Circuit (the “Sixth Circuit”). HCP argues
    that the judgment against it should be vacated and the case
    remanded for a new trial

and/or

that
    judgment should be entered in its favor as a matter of law. We
    are vigorously contesting HCP’s appeal and seek
    confirmation by the Sixth Circuit of both the jury’s
    verdict and the various rulings in our favor in the District
    Court.

On November 24, 2009, we filed a cross-appeal to the Sixth
    Circuit, which will be heard and decided in conjunction with
    HCP’s appeal. In addition to maintaining the full benefit
    of our favorable jury verdict, in our cross-appeal, we have
    asserted that we are entitled to substantial monetary relief in
    addition to the jury verdict, including punitive damages,
    additional compensatory damages and pre-judgment interest. We
    are vigorously pursuing our cross-appeal and are seeking
    additional proceedings in the District Court in which a jury may
    supplement the current judgment.

On December 11, 2009, HCP posted a $102.8 million
    letter of credit in our favor to serve as security to stay
    execution of the jury verdict pending the appellate proceedings.



VENTAS,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

The briefing process for HCP’s appeal and our cross-appeal
    is complete, and oral argument has been scheduled for
    March 10, 2011. We expect that a final decision by the
    Sixth Circuit will be issued in 2011. We cannot assure you as to
    the outcome of HCP’s appeal or our cross-appeal or the
    timing of a decision by the Sixth Circuit.

Other
    Litigation

We are party to various other lawsuits, investigations and
    claims (some of which may not be insured) arising in the normal
    course of our business, including without limitation in
    connection with our senior living and MOB operations. It is the
    opinion of our management that, except as otherwise set forth in
    this Note 15, the disposition of these actions,
    investigations and claims will not, individually or in the
    aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on us. However, we are
    unable to predict the ultimate outcome of pending litigation,
    investigations and claims, and if management’s assessment
    of our liability with respect to these actions, investigations
    and claims is incorrect, such actions, investigations and claims
    could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Note 16 —

Capital
    Stock

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our authorized capital stock
    consisted of 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value
    $0.25 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
    par value $1.00 per share.

In February 2011, we completed the sale of 5,563,000 shares
    of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant
    to our existing shelf registration statement. We received
    $300.0 million in aggregate proceeds from the sale, which
    we intend to use to repay existing mortgage debt and for working
    capital and other general corporate purposes, including to fund
    future acquisitions or investments, if any.

In March 2010, we filed a registration statement on

Form S-3

with the SEC relating to the resale, from time to time, by the
    selling stockholders of shares of our common stock, if any, that
    may become issuable upon conversion of our outstanding


/


%
    convertible senior notes due 2011. The registration statement
    replaced our previous resale shelf registration statement, which
    expired pursuant to the SEC’s rules.

In April 2009, we issued and sold 13,062,500 shares of our
    common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our
    existing shelf registration statement. We received
    $312.2 million in aggregate proceeds from the sale, before
    the underwriting discount and expenses, which we used, together
    with our net proceeds from the sale of our senior notes due
    2016, to fund our cash tender offers for outstanding senior
    notes, to repay debt and for general corporate purposes.

In April 2009, we filed an automatic shelf registration
    statement on

Form S-3

with the SEC relating to the sale, from time to time, of an
    indeterminate amount of debt securities and related guarantees,
    common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants.
    The registration statement replaced our previous automatic shelf
    registration statement, which expired pursuant to the SEC’s
    rules.

Excess
    Share Provision

In order to preserve our ability to maintain REIT status, our
    Certificate of Incorporation provides that if a person acquires
    beneficial ownership of more than 9% of our outstanding common
    stock or 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock, the shares
    that are beneficially owned in excess of such limit are deemed
    to be excess shares. These shares are automatically deemed
    transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable
    institution or other qualifying organization selected by our
    Board of Directors. The trust is entitled to all dividends with
    respect to the shares and the trustee may exercise all voting
    power over the shares.

We have the right to buy the excess shares for a purchase price
    equal to the lesser of the price per share in the transaction
    that created the excess shares or the market price on the date
    we buy the shares, and we



VENTAS,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

may defer payment of the purchase price for the excess shares
    for up to five years. If we do not purchase the excess shares,
    the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the excess
    shares at the direction of the Board of Directors. The owner of
    the excess shares is entitled to receive the lesser of the
    proceeds from the sale or the original purchase price for such
    excess shares, and any additional amounts are payable to the
    beneficiary of the trust.

Our Board of Directors is empowered to grant waivers from the
    excess share provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation.

Distribution
    Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

We have in effect a Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
    Plan (“DRIP”), under which existing stockholders may
    purchase shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion
    of the cash distribution on their shares of our common stock,
    subject to certain limits. Existing stockholders and new
    investors also may purchase shares of our common stock under the
    DRIP by making optional cash payments, subject to certain
    limits. We currently offer a 1% discount on the purchase price
    of our common stock to shareholders who reinvest their dividends

and/or

make
    optional cash purchases through the DRIP. The amount and
    availability of this discount is at our discretion. The granting
    of a discount for one month or quarter, as applicable, will not
    insure the availability or amount of a discount in future
    periods, and each month or quarter, as applicable, we may lower
    or eliminate the discount without prior notice. We may also,
    without prior notice, change our determination as to whether
    common shares will be purchased by the plan administrator
    directly from us or in the open market.

Segment
    Information

As of December 31, 2010, we operated through three
    reportable business segments:

triple-net

leased properties, senior living operations and MOB operations.
    Our

triple-net

leased properties segment consists of acquiring and owning
    seniors housing and healthcare properties in the United States
    and leasing those properties to healthcare operating companies
    under

“triple-net”

or

“absolute-net”

leases, which require the tenants to pay all property-related
    expenses. Our senior living operations segment consists of
    investments in seniors housing communities located in the United
    States and Canada for which we engage independent third parties,
    such as Sunrise, to manage the operations. Our MOB operations
    segment primarily consists of acquiring, owning, developing,
    leasing and managing MOBs.

With the addition of the Lillibridge businesses and properties
    in July 2010, we believed the segregation of our MOB operations
    into its own reporting segment would be useful in assessing the
    performance of this portion of our business in the same way that
    management intends to review our performance and make operating
    decisions. Prior to the Lillibridge acquisition, we operated
    through two reportable segments:

triple-net

leased properties and senior living operations. Prior year
    amounts have been restated to reflect the segregation of our MOB
    operations into a reportable business segment.

We evaluate performance of the combined properties in each
    segment based on segment profit, which we define as NOI adjusted
    for gain/loss from unconsolidated entities. We define NOI as
    total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level
    operating expenses and MOB services costs. We believe that net
    income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings
    measurement. However, we believe that segment profit serves as a
    useful supplement to net income because it allows investors,
    analysts and our management to measure unlevered property-level
    operating results and to compare our operating results to the
    operating results of other real estate companies and between
    periods on a consistent basis. Segment profit should not be
    considered as an alternative to net income (determined in
    accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial
    performance. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of our
    consolidated historical operating results, segment profit should
    be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our
    Consolidated Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Interest expense, depreciation and amortization, general,
    administrative and professional fees and non-property specific
    revenues and expenses are not allocated to individual segments
    for purposes of assessing segment performance. There are no
    intersegment sales or transfers.

All other revenues consist primarily of income from loans and
    investments and other miscellaneous income. All other assets
    consist primarily of corporate assets including cash, restricted
    cash, deferred financing costs, notes receivable, and
    miscellaneous accounts receivable.

Condensed
    Consolidating Information

Initially, we and certain of our direct and indirect wholly
    owned subsidiaries (the “Wholly Owned Subsidiary
    Guarantors”) fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a
    joint and several basis, the obligation to pay principal and
    interest with respect to the senior notes of the Issuers (other
    than our 3.125% senior notes due 2015). Ventas Capital
    Corporation is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Ventas Realty
    that was formed in 2002 to facilitate offerings of the senior
    notes and has no assets or operations. In addition, Ventas
    Realty and the Wholly Owned Subsidiary Guarantors fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, the
    obligation to pay principal and interest with respect to our
    convertible notes. Other subsidiaries (“Non-Guarantor
    Subsidiaries”) that were not included among the Guarantors
    were not obligated with respect to the senior notes or the
    convertible notes. On September 30, 2010, the Wholly Owned
    Subsidiary Guarantors were released from their obligations with
    respect to each series of then outstanding senior notes (other
    than the 9% senior notes due 2012) of the Issuers and
    our convertible notes pursuant to the terms of the applicable
    indentures. Contractual and legal restrictions, including those
    contained in the instruments governing certain



VENTAS,

Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries’ outstanding indebtedness, may
    under certain circumstances restrict our ability to obtain cash
    from our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting
    our debt service obligations, including our guarantee of payment
    of principal and interest on the senior notes and our primary
    obligation to pay principal and interest on the convertible
    notes. Certain of our real estate assets are also subject to
    mortgages. The following summarizes our condensed consolidating
    information as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008:
