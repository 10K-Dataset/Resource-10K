•

The ability and willingness of our tenants to renew their leases with us upon expiration of the leases and our ability to relet our properties on the same or better
terms in the event such leases expire and are not renewed by the existing tenants;

•

Risks associated with our acquisition of Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust (“Sunrise REIT”), including the timely delivery of accurate
property-level financial results for our properties and our ability to timely and fully realize the expected revenues and cost savings therefrom;

Factors causing volatility in our revenues generated by our seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries,
“Sunrise”), including without limitation national and regional economic conditions, costs of materials, energy, labor and services, employee benefit costs and professional and general liability claims;

•

Kindred, and our earnings;

•

The impact on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of our operators, tenants, borrowers and managers, as applicable, resulting from
increased operating costs and uninsured liabilities for professional liability claims, and the ability of our operators, tenants, borrowers and managers to accurately estimate the magnitude of these liabilities; and

•

The impact of the Sunrise strategic review process and accounting, legal and regulatory issues.

Many of these factors, some of which we describe in greater detail in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are beyond our control and

board of directors had decided to explore strategic alternatives intended to enhance shareholder value, including a possible sale of Sunrise. Sunrise has also announced that it intends to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2006 no later than March 17, 2008, although there can be no assurance it will do so. If Sunrise does not so file, its shares will likely be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. We cannot predict what impact, if any, the
outcomes of these uncertainties will have on Sunrise’s financial condition or ability to manage our senior living operations. You are encouraged to obtain additional information related to Sunrise at the Commission’s website at
www.sec.gov.

Certain Information Regarding ElderTrust Operating Limited Partnership

PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

BUSINESS

Overview

We are a REIT with a
geographically diverse portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare-related properties in the United States and Canada. As of December 31, 2007, this portfolio consisted of 519 assets: 253 seniors housing communities, 197 skilled nursing
facilities, 42 hospitals and 27 medical office and other properties in 43 states and two Canadian provinces, including 77 seniors housing communities we acquired from Sunrise REIT on April 26, 2007. With the exception of our medical office
buildings (“MOBs”) and 79 of our seniors housing communities that are managed by Sunrise pursuant to long-term management agreements, we lease these properties to healthcare operating companies under “triple-net” or
“absolute-net” leases, which require the tenants to pay all property-related expenses. We also had real estate loan investments relating to seniors housing and healthcare-related third parties as of December 31, 2007.

We conduct substantially all of our business through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership, PSLT OP, L.P. and Ventas SSL,
Inc., and ETOP, in which we own substantially all of the partnership units. Our primary business consists of financing, owning and leasing seniors housing and healthcare-related properties and leasing or subleasing those properties to third parties
or operating those properties through independent third party managers.

We were incorporated in Kentucky in 1983, commenced operations in
1985 and reorganized as a Delaware corporation in 1987. We operate through two reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties and senior living operations. See our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes, including
“Note 2

—

Accounting Policies,” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our business
strategy is comprised of two primary objectives: (1) diversifying our portfolio of properties and (2) increasing our earnings. We intend to continue to diversify our real estate portfolio by operator, property type, geography and
reimbursement source through investments in, and acquisitions and/or development of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare-related assets across a wide spectrum.

Portfolio of Properties

As of December 31, 2007: we had a 100% ownership interest in 451 of our
properties, consisting of 192 seniors housing communities, 42 hospitals, 197 skilled nursing facilities and 20 other properties; we had a 75% to 85% ownership interest in 61 seniors housing communities, with the minority interest in those
communities being owned by Sunrise; and we had a majority ownership interest in seven MOBs, with the minority interest in those properties ranging from less than 1% to less than 9% being owned by three different partners that provide management and
leasing services for the properties.



The following table provides an overview of our portfolio of properties and other real estate investments
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007:

(1)

As of December 31, 2007, we owned seniors housing and healthcare-related properties located in 43 states and two Canadian provinces. These properties were operated or managed
by 21 different operators or third- party managers.

(2)

As of December 31, 2007, sixteen of our MOBs were operated by third-party managers and three were under triple-net leases.

(3)

The remainder of our total revenues is interest and other income.

Seniors Housing and Healthcare-Related Properties

Seniors Housing Communities

.    Our seniors housing communities include independent and assisted living communities, and
communities providing care for individuals with Alzheimer’s and other forms of memory loss. These communities offer residential units on a month-to-month basis primarily to elderly individuals requiring various levels of assistance. Basic
services for residents of these communities include housekeeping, meals in a central dining area and group activities organized by the staff with input from the residents. More extensive care and personal supervision, at additional fees, are also
available for such needs as eating, bathing, grooming, transportation, limited therapeutic programs and medication administration, all of which encourage the residents to live as independently as possible according to their abilities. These services
are often met by home health providers, close coordination with the resident’s physician and skilled nursing facilities.

Skilled
Nursing Facilities

.    Our skilled nursing facilities typically provide nursing care services to the elderly and rehabilitation and restoration services, including physical, occupational and speech therapies, and other
medical treatment for patients and residents who do not require the high technology, care-intensive setting of an acute care or rehabilitation hospital.

Hospitals

.    Our hospitals generally are long-term acute care hospitals that serve medically complex, chronically ill patients who require a high level of monitoring and specialized care,
but whose conditions do not necessitate the continued services of an intensive care unit. The operator of these hospitals has the capability to treat patients who suffer from multiple systemic failures or conditions such as neurological disorders,
head injuries, brain stem and spinal cord trauma, cerebral vascular accidents, chemical brain injuries, central nervous system disorders, developmental anomalies and cardiopulmonary disorders. Chronic patients are often dependent on technology for
continued life support, such as mechanical ventilators, total parenteral nutrition, respiration or cardiac monitors and dialysis machines, and, therefore, due to their severe medical conditions, these patients generally are not clinically
appropriate for admission to a nursing facility or rehabilitation hospital.



Medical Office Buildings

.    Our medical office buildings offer office space
primarily to physicians and other healthcare-related businesses.

Other Properties

.    Our other properties
consist of personal care facilities, which provide specialized care, including supported living services, neurorehabilitation, neurobehavioral management and vocational programs, for persons with acquired or traumatic brain injury.

Other Real Estate Investments

As of
December 31, 2007, our other real estate investments consisted of three first mortgage loans, secured by four properties, in the outstanding aggregate principal amount of $20.1 million.

Each first mortgage loan accrues interest at a rate of 9% per annum and provides for monthly amortization of principal with a balloon payment
maturity date ranging between April and July 2010. One of these loans is guaranteed by a third party, unrelated to the borrower, and its two principals. The remaining two loans are guaranteed by an affiliate of the borrower and its two principals.

See “Note 8

—

Loans Receivable” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Geographic Diversification

Our portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare-related properties is broadly diversified by geographic location in the United States and Canada, with
properties in two states comprising more than 10% of our 2007 total revenues. The following table shows our rental income and resident fees and services derived by geographic location for our portfolio of properties:

(1)

The remainder of our total revenues is interest from loans receivable and interest and other income.



Segment Information

As of December 31, 2007, we operated through two reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties and senior living operations. See “Note 19—Segment Information” of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about our business segments and the geographic diversification of our portfolio of properties.

Certificates of Need

A majority of
our skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are located in states that have certificate of need (“CON”) requirements. A CON, which is issued by a governmental agency with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities, is at times required for
expansion of existing facilities, construction of new facilities, addition of beds, acquisition of major items of equipment or introduction of new services. The CON rules and regulations may restrict our or our operators’ ability to expand our
properties in certain circumstances.

The following table shows the percentage of our rental income derived by skilled nursing facilities
and hospitals in states with and without CON requirements:

Sunrise REIT Acquisition

On April 26, 2007, we completed the acquisition of all of the assets of Sunrise REIT pursuant to the terms of a purchase agreement dated as of January 14, 2007, as amended, among us, our wholly owned
subsidiaries, Ventas SSL Ontario I, Inc. (the “Securities Purchaser”) and Ventas SSL Ontario II, Inc. (the “Asset Purchaser” and, together with the Securities Purchaser, the “Purchasers”), Sunrise REIT, Sunrise REIT
Trust (“Sub Trust”) and Sunrise REIT GP Inc. (“Sunrise GP”), in its capacity as general partner of Sunrise Canadian UPREIT, LP (“UPREIT”). The aggregate consideration for the Sunrise REIT acquisition, including the
assumption of debt, was approximately $2.0 billion.

At the effective time of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, the Securities Purchaser
purchased all of the interests and assumed all of the liabilities of Sunrise REIT Canadian Holdings Inc. (“Canco”) and certain of Sunrise REIT’s intercompany notes held by Sub Trust, and the Asset Purchaser acquired all of Sunrise
REIT’s remaining assets and liabilities from Sunrise REIT, Sub Trust and UPREIT. Immediately following the Sunrise REIT acquisition, each unit of beneficial interest of Sunrise REIT outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (except
for a small number of non-tendered units) was redeemed for Cdn $16.50 in cash.

Through the Sunrise REIT acquisition, we acquired a 100%
interest in 18 seniors housing communities and a 75% to 85% interest in 59 additional seniors housing communities, with the minority interest in those 59 communities being owned by affiliates of Sunrise. Of the 77 communities, 66 are located in
metropolitan areas of 19 U.S. states and eleven are located in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and British Columbia.

As a result of the
Sunrise REIT acquisition, we are party to management agreements with Sunrise pursuant to which Sunrise provides comprehensive accounting and property management services with respect to each of the Sunrise REIT properties. Each management agreement
has a term of 30 years from its effective date, the



earliest of which began in 2004. Pursuant to the management agreements, we pay Sunrise a base management fee of 6% of resident fees and similar revenues,
subject to reduction based on below target performance for a pool of properties. The minimum management fee assessable under these agreements is 5% of resident fees and similar revenues of the properties. We also pay incentive fees if a pool of
properties exceeds aggregate performance targets; provided, however, that total management fees, including incentive fees, shall not exceed 8% of resident fees and similar revenues. The management agreements also specify that we (or the joint
venture to which we are party, as applicable) will reimburse Sunrise for direct or indirect costs necessary to manage our seniors housing communities.

Under the terms of the letter agreement dated January 14, 2007 (the “Letter Agreement”) between us and Sunrise, we modified various management and other agreements and contractual relationships that
existed between Sunrise, on the one hand, and Sunrise REIT, on the other hand (the “Existing Agreements”). Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Strategic Alliance Agreement dated as of December 23, 2004 between Sunrise and Sunrise
REIT was terminated effective upon the closing of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, except with respect to certain limited provisions. Under the terms of the Letter Agreement, we have, among other things, a right of first offer to acquire seniors
housing communities developed by Sunrise in Canada. In addition, we have a right of first offer to acquire seniors housing communities developed by Sunrise in the United States within a demographically defined radius of any of the properties
acquired by us in the Sunrise REIT acquisition. The terms of the rights of first offer for properties in both the United States and Canada are governed generally by the terms set forth in the Strategic Alliance Agreement and the fixed price
acquisition agreement referred to in the Strategic Alliance Agreement, but subject to modification of those terms to address changes in circumstances and other matters.

The Letter Agreement also (1) provides us assurances that Sunrise will cooperate with us in connection with our compliance with the REIT rules under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), and in connection with our financial reporting obligations, (2) contains restrictions on our rights to transfer our interest in the acquired properties to transferees who compete with Sunrise or who do not meet certain
requirements, and (3) provides that Sunrise consents to the Sunrise REIT acquisition and waives certain rights under the Existing Agreements. Although not required, we and Sunrise may enter into various amendments to the Existing Agreements to
further address the matters set out in the Letter Agreement.

As a result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, we assumed all rights and
obligations of Sunrise REIT under two fixed price acquisition agreements with Sunrise. Under the terms of these fixed price acquisition agreements, funds were advanced prior to the Sunrise REIT acquisition to Sunrise in connection with the
development by Sunrise of seniors housing communities in Staten Island, New York and Vaughan, Ontario. The fixed price acquisition agreements granted to us an option to purchase a majority interest in each of these properties, independently, for a
fixed price and on fixed terms, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The funds advanced for a property under the fixed price acquisition agreements are advances on the fixed purchase price for the property and are applied to our
purchase price for our interest at the closing of the acquisition.

We funded the Sunrise REIT acquisition through $530.0 million of
borrowings under a senior interim loan, an equity-backed facility providing for the issuance of 700,000 shares of our Series A Senior Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, and the assumption of $861.1 million of
existing mortgage debt. In May 2007, we completed the sale of 26,910,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our shelf registration statement. We received $1.05 billion in net proceeds from the sale, which we
used along with the proceeds of the disposition of certain of our Kindred assets (see “Note 6

—

Dispositions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K)
and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility to redeem all of our Series A Senior Preferred Stock and to repay our indebtedness under the senior interim loan.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, we expensed $5.2 million of preferred stock dividends and issuance costs related to the Series A Senior
Preferred Stock and $5.0 million of fees and interest associated with the



senior interim loan (the latter of which is included in interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2007
included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

On June 19, 2007, we acquired an 80% interest in the
seniors housing community located in Staten Island, New York in accordance with the terms of the applicable fixed price acquisition agreement for approximately $25.5 million, inclusive of our share of assumed debt of $15.3 million.

On December 11, 2007, we acquired an 80% interest in the seniors housing community located in Vaughan, Ontario in accordance with the terms of
the applicable fixed price acquisition agreement for approximately Cdn $43.6 million, inclusive of our share of assumed debt of Cdn $23.3 million.

We incurred $3.0 million of merger-related expenses (that were not capitalized) in connection with the Sunrise REIT acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2007. Merger-related expenses include incremental costs directly related
to the acquisition and expenses relating to our lawsuit against HCP, Inc. related to our acquisition of Sunrise REIT, in which we are the plaintiff.

Significant Tenants and Operators

As of December 31, 2007, approximately 39.7%, 22.0% and 14.9% of our properties,
based on their original cost, were managed or operated by Sunrise, Brookdale Senior Living and Kindred, respectively. Total revenues attributable to senior living operations managed by Sunrise were $283.1 million for the period from April 26,
2007 through December 31, 2007, representing 36.2% of our total revenues (including amounts in discontinued operations) for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately 15.7% and 30.8% of our total revenues (including amounts in
discontinued operations) for the year ended December 31, 2007 were derived from our leases with Brookdale Senior Living and our master lease agreements with Kindred (the “Kindred Master Leases”), respectively. Our affiliation with
Sunrise is a result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition in April 2007. Our affiliation with Brookdale Senior Living is a result of our acquisition of Provident Senior Living Trust (“Provident”) in June 2005 and the subsequent combination of
Brookdale and Alterra under Brookdale Senior Living. Our affiliation with Kindred is a result of our spin off of Kindred in May 1998, pursuant to which we transferred to Kindred our previous hospital, nursing facility and ancillary services
businesses and we retained substantially all of the real property which we leased to Kindred.

Triple-Net Leased Properties

Each of our leases with Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living is a triple-net lease pursuant to which the tenant is required to pay all
insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repairs related to the properties. In addition, the tenants are required to comply with the terms of the mortgage financing documents, if any, affecting the properties.

Because we lease a substantial portion of our triple-net leased properties to Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living and they are each a significant source
of our total revenues, their financial condition and ability and willingness to satisfy their obligations under their respective leases and certain other agreements with us and their willingness to renew those leases upon expiration of the initial
base terms thereof will significantly impact our revenues and our ability to service our indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. We cannot assure you that Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living will have sufficient assets, income and
access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under its respective leases and other agreements with us, and any inability or unwillingness on its part to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operation and liquidity, on our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT (a “Material Adverse
Effect”). We also cannot assure you that Kindred and/or Brookdale Senior Living will elect to renew their respective leases with us upon expiration of the initial base terms or any renewal terms thereof. See “Risks Arising from Our
Business—We are dependent on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living; either of Kindred’s or



Brookdale Senior Living’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability
to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Kindred Master Leases.

The properties leased to Kindred pursuant to the Kindred Master Leases are grouped into renewal
bundles, with each bundle containing a varying number of properties. All properties within a bundle have primary terms ranging from ten to 15 years from May 1, 1998 and, provided certain conditions are satisfied, are subject to three five-year
renewal terms.

Under each Kindred Master Lease, the aggregate annual rent is referred to as Base Rent (as defined in the applicable
Kindred Master Lease). Base Rent escalates on May 1 of each year at a specified rate over the Prior Period Base Rent (as defined in the applicable Kindred Master Lease) contingent upon the satisfaction of specified facility revenue parameters.
On October 6, 2006, final appraisers designated by us and Kindred specified that the market annual rent escalator is 2.7% under Kindred Master Leases 1, 3 and 4, and is based on year-over-year changes in the Consumer Price Index, with a floor
of 2.25% and a ceiling of 4%, under Kindred Master Lease 2. Assuming the specified revenue parameters are met, Base Rent due under the Kindred Master Leases will be approximately $241.7 million from May 1, 2008 to April 30, 2009. See
“Note 3

—

Revenues from Properties” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

On April 27, 2007, Kindred renewed, through April 30, 2013, its leases covering all 64 healthcare assets owned by us (seven of which we
subsequently sold on June 30, 2007 (see “Note 6

—

Dispositions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K)) whose base term would have expired on
April 30, 2008. Kindred retains two additional sequential five-year renewal options for these assets.

Brookdale Senior Living
Leases.

Our leases with Brookdale have primary terms of 15 years, commencing either January 28, 2004 (in the case of 15 “Grand Court” properties we acquired in early 2004) or October 19, 2004 (in the
case of the properties we acquired in connection with the Provident acquisition), and, provided certain conditions are satisfied, are subject to two ten-year renewal terms. Our leases with Alterra also have primary terms of 15 years, commencing
either October 20, 2004 or December 16, 2004 (both in the case of properties we acquired in connection with the Provident acquisition), and, provided certain conditions are satisfied, are subject to two five-year renewal terms.

Under the terms of the Brookdale leases assumed in connection with the Provident acquisition, Brookdale is obligated to pay base rent, which escalates
on January 1 of each year, by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) four times the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index during the immediately preceding year or (ii) 3%. Under the terms of the Brookdale leases with respect
to our “Grand Court” properties, Brookdale is obligated to pay base rent, which escalates on February 1 of each year, by an amount equal to the greater of (i) 2% or (ii) 75% of the increase in the Consumer Price Index during
the immediately preceding year. Under the terms of the Alterra leases, Alterra is obligated to pay base rent, which escalates either on January 1 or November 1 of each year by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) four times the
percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index during the immediately preceding year or (ii) 2.5%. The aggregate annualized contractual cash base rent expected from Brookdale Senior Living for 2008 is approximately $106.7 million, excluding
variable interest Brookdale is obligated to pay as additional rent based on various variable rate mortgages assumed by us during the Provident acquisition. The aggregate annualized contractual GAAP rent (computed in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)), excluding the variable interest, expected from Brookdale Senior Living for 2008 is approximately $119.9 million. See “Note 3

Senior Living Operations

We are party to management agreements with Sunrise pursuant to which Sunrise currently provides comprehensive accounting and property management services
with respect to 79 of our seniors housing communities. Each management agreement has a term of 30 years from its effective date, the earliest of which began in 2004.

Although we have various rights as owner under the Sunrise management agreements, we are relying on Sunrise’s personnel, good faith, expertise, historical performance, technical resources and information systems,
proprietary information and judgment to manage our seniors housing communities efficiently and effectively. Because a significant portion of our properties are managed by Sunrise, its inability to efficiently and effectively manage those properties
and to provide timely and accurate accounting information with respect thereto could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. We are also relying on Sunrise to set resident fees and otherwise operate those properties pursuant to our management
agreements. A change in the senior management of Sunrise or any adverse developments in Sunrise’s business and affairs or financial strength could also have a Material Adverse Effect on us. In addition, any inability or unwillingness on the
part of Sunrise to satisfy its obligations under the management agreements it has with us could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Competition

We compete for real property investments with healthcare providers, other healthcare-related REITs, healthcare lenders, real estate
partnerships, banks, insurance companies and other investors. Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources and lower cost of capital than we do. Our ability to continue to compete successfully for real
property investments will be determined by numerous factors, including our ability to identify suitable acquisition or investment targets, our ability to negotiate acceptable terms for any such acquisition and the availability and cost of capital to
us. See “Risks Arising from Our Business—We may encounter certain risks when implementing our business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare-related
assets” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “Note 9

—

Borrowing Arrangements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The operators and managers of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with other seniors housing and healthcare operators and
managers. Their ability to compete successfully for residents and patients at our properties depends upon several factors, including the scope and quality of services provided, the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, the operational
reputation of the operator or manager, physician referral patterns, physical appearance of the properties, other competitive systems of healthcare delivery within the community, population and demographics, and the financial condition of the
operator or manager. Private, federal and state reimbursement programs and the effect of other laws and regulations also may have a significant impact on our healthcare operators’ and managers’ ability to compete successfully for residents
and patients at the properties. See “Risks Arising from Our Business—Our tenants, managers and operators may be adversely affected by increasing healthcare regulation and enforcement” and “—Changes in the reimbursement rates
or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we had 53
full-time employees. We consider the relationship with our employees to be good.

Insurance

We maintain and/or require in our existing leases or other agreements that our tenants, managers and operators maintain liability and casualty insurance
on our properties and their operations. For example, under the



Kindred Master Leases, Kindred is required to maintain, at its expense, certain insurance coverage related to the properties under the Kindred Master Leases
and Kindred’s operations at those properties. However, we cannot assure you that Kindred or our other tenants, managers and operators will maintain such insurance, and any failure by our tenants, managers and operators to do so could have a
Material Adverse Effect on us. We believe that our tenants, managers and operators are in substantial compliance with the insurance requirements contained in their respective leases and other agreements with us.

General and professional liability and casualty insurance covering our properties managed by Sunrise and the related operations is currently maintained
by Sunrise in accordance with the standards contained in our management agreement with Sunrise. On an annual basis, we may elect to opt in or out of the Sunrise insurance program. If we choose to opt out of the Sunrise insurance program, we would
maintain general and professional liability and casualty insurance for our Sunrise-managed properties in accordance with the standards contained in our Sunrise management agreements. Regardless of who maintains this insurance, however, the costs of
the insurance program covering our Sunrise-managed properties are facility expenses paid from the revenues of these properties.

We believe
that the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our own and our tenants’, managers’ and operators’ policies are customary for similarly situated companies in our industry. We cannot assure you that in the future such
insurance will be available at a reasonable price or that we will be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance coverage.

Due to
historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has been restricted and the premiums for such insurance coverage remain very high. As a
result, many healthcare providers may incur large funded and unfunded professional liability expense, which could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, many healthcare
providers are pursuing different organizational and corporate structures coupled with insurance programs that provide less insurance coverage. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our tenants, managers and operators will continue to carry the
insurance coverage required under the terms of their leases and other agreements with us or that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under those leases and agreements.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Healthcare Regulation

General

The operators of certain of our properties derive a substantial portion of their revenues from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, certain disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a medical assistance program jointly
funded by federal and state governments and administered by each state pursuant to which benefits are available to certain indigent patients. The Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework is subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and
discretion that affect the amount and timing of reimbursement made under Medicare and Medicaid. The amounts of program payments received by our operators and tenants can be changed from time to time, and at any time, by legislative or regulatory
actions and by determinations by agents for the programs. See “—Healthcare Reform.” Such changes may be applied retroactively under certain circumstances. In addition, private payors, including managed care payors, continually demand
discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk. Efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon operators by private payors are expected to intensify and
continue. We cannot assure you that adequate third-party reimbursement levels will continue to be available for services to be provided by the operators of our properties which currently are being reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and private payors.
Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on these operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could affect adversely their
ability to make rental payments under, and otherwise comply with the terms of, their leases with us.

The operators of certain of our
properties are subject to other extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities, services,
prices for services, billing for services, and the confidentiality and security of health-related information. These laws authorize periodic inspections and investigations, and identification of deficiencies that, if not corrected, can result in
sanctions that include suspension or loss of licensure to operate and loss of rights to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Regulatory agencies have substantial powers to affect the actions of operators of our properties if the
agencies believe that there is an imminent threat to patient welfare, and in some states these powers can include assumption of interim control over facilities through receiverships.

Seniors Housing Communities.

Our seniors housing communities include independent and assisted living communities, and
communities providing care for individuals with Alzheimer’s and other forms of memory loss. These communities offer residential units on a month-to-month basis primarily to elderly individuals requiring various levels of assistance. Basic
services for residents of these communities include housekeeping, meals in a central dining area and group activities organized by the staff with input from the residents. More extensive care and personal supervision, at additional fees, are also
available for such needs as eating, bathing, grooming, transportation, limited therapeutic programs and medication administration, all of which encourage the residents to live as independently as possible according to their abilities. These services
are often met by home health providers, close coordination with the resident’s physician and skilled nursing facilities.

Seniors
housing communities are subject to relatively few, if any, federal regulations. Instead, to the extent they are regulated, the regulation is conducted mainly by state and local laws which govern the licensing of beds, the provision of services,
staffing requirements and other operational matters. However, these state laws vary greatly from one state to another.

The recent increase
in the number of seniors housing communities around the country has attracted the attention of various federal agencies which believe there should be more federal regulation of these properties.



To date, Congress has deferred to state regulation of seniors housing communities. As a result of the increased federal scrutiny along with the rapid
increase in the number of these properties, some states have revised and strengthened their regulation of seniors housing communities. More states are expected to do the same in the future.

Skilled Nursing Facilities.

The operators of our skilled nursing facilities generally are licensed on an annual or
bi-annual basis and certified annually for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs through various regulatory agencies which determine compliance with federal, state and local laws. These legal requirements relate to the quality of the
nursing care provided, qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff, the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment and continuing compliance with the laws and regulations governing the operation of nursing facilities. A loss
of licensure or certification could adversely affect a nursing facility’s ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which, in turn, could adversely impact the operator’s ability to make rental payments under its
leases with us.

Hospitals.

Substantially all of our hospitals are operated as long-term acute care
hospitals, which are hospitals that have a Medicare average length of stay greater than 25 days. Our hospitals are freestanding facilities, and we do not own any “hospitals within hospitals.” In order to receive Medicare and Medicaid
reimbursement, each hospital must meet the applicable conditions of participation set forth by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) relating to the type of hospital and its equipment, personnel and standard of medical
care, as well as comply with state and local laws and regulations. Hospitals undergo periodic on-site licensure surveys, which generally are limited if the hospital is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
or other recognized accreditation organizations. A loss of licensure or certification could adversely affect a hospital’s ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which, in turn, could adversely impact the
operator’s ability to make rental payments under its leases with us.

Any significant expansion in the number or type of, or a
violation of any of, these federal, state or local laws and regulations also could have a material adverse effect on our operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which, in turn, could adversely impact their ability
to make rental payments under, or otherwise comply with the terms of, their leases with us.

Certificates of Need

Some states require state approval for development and expansion of healthcare facilities and services, including findings of need for additional or
expanded healthcare facilities or services. A CON is issued by a governmental agency with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities and is at times required for expansion of existing facilities, construction of new facilities, addition of beds, and
acquisition of major items of equipment or introduction of new services. The CON rules and regulations may restrict an operator’s ability to expand our properties in certain circumstances.

In the last several years, in response to mounting Medicaid budget deficits, many states have begun to tighten CON controls, including the imposition of
moratoriums on new nursing facilities and hospitals. Some states have also increased controls over licensing and change-of-ownership rules.

In the event that any operator of our properties fails to make rental payments to us or to comply with the applicable healthcare regulations, and, in either case, the operator or its lenders fail to cure the default prior to the expiration
of the applicable cure period, our ability to evict that operator and substitute another operator or operators may be materially delayed or limited by various state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by Medicare and Medicaid
change-of-ownership rules. Such delays and limitations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to collect rent, to obtain possession of leased properties, or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant default. In addition, we may also
incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any such licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings.



Fraud and Abuse

There are extensive federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, the violation of which could result in significant criminal and civil penalties that can materially
affect the operators of our properties. The federal laws include:

•

The anti-kickback statute (Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act), which prohibits certain business practices and relationships that might affect the
provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by Medicare or other
governmental programs.

•

The physician self-referral prohibition (Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the “Stark Law”), which prohibits referrals by
physicians of Medicare patients to providers of a broad range of designated healthcare services with which the physicians (or their immediate family members) or Medicaid have ownership interests or certain other financial arrangements.

•

The False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government (including the Medicare
and Medicaid programs).

•

The Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which authorizes HHS to impose civil penalties administratively for fraudulent acts.

•

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (commonly referred to as “HIPAA”), which among other things, protects the privacy and
security of individually identifiable health information by limiting its use and disclosure.

Sanctions for violating
these federal laws include criminal and civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, money penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, and/or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These
laws also impose an affirmative duty on operators to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the Medicare and other government programs.

Many states have adopted or are considering legislative proposals similar to the federal fraud and abuse laws, some of which extend beyond the Medicare and Medicaid programs to prohibit the payment or receipt of
remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self-referrals regardless of whether the service was reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid. Many states have also adopted or are considering legislative proposals to increase patient protections,
such as minimum staffing levels, criminal background checks, and limiting the use and disclosure of patient specific health information. These state laws also impose criminal and civil penalties similar to the federal laws.

In the ordinary course of their business, the operators of our properties have been and are subject regularly to inquiries, investigations and audits by
federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. Increased funding through recent federal and state legislation has led to a dramatic increase in the number of investigations and enforcement actions over the past several years.
Private enforcement of healthcare fraud also has increased due in large part to amendments to the civil False Claims Act in 1986 that were designed to encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits by
private individuals, known as qui tam suits, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former patients or nurses and other employees. HIPAA also created a series of new healthcare-related crimes.

As federal and state budget pressures continue, federal and state administrative agencies may also continue to escalate investigation and enforcement
efforts to eliminate waste and to control fraud and abuse in governmental healthcare programs. A violation of any of these federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operators’ liquidity,
financial condition and results of operations, which could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments under, or otherwise comply with the terms of, their leases with us.



Healthcare Reform

Healthcare is one of the largest industries in the United States and continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention. In an effort to reduce federal spending on healthcare, in 1997 the federal
government enacted the Balanced Budget Act (“BBA”), which contained extensive changes to the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including substantial Medicare reimbursement reductions for healthcare operations. For certain healthcare
providers, including hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, implementation of the BBA resulted in more drastic reimbursement reductions than had been anticipated. In addition to its impact on Medicare, the BBA also afforded states more
flexibility in administering their Medicaid plans, including the ability to shift most Medicaid enrollees into managed care plans without first obtaining a federal waiver.

The following key legislative and regulatory changes have been made to the BBA to provide some relief from the drastic reductions in Medicare and
Medicaid reimbursement resulting from implementation of the BBA:

•

The Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (“BBRA”);

•

The Medicare, Medicaid, and State Child Health Insurance Program Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (“BIPA”);

•

The one-time “administrative fix” to increase skilled nursing facility payment rates by 3.26%, instituted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (“CMS”) beginning on October 1, 2003;

•

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“Medicare Modernization Act,” sometimes referred to as the “Drug
Bill”);

•

The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Pub. L No. 109-171) (“DRA”); and

•

The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (Pub. L. No. 109-432).

The Medicare and Medicaid programs, including payment levels and methods, are continually evolving and are less predictable following the enactment of
BBA and the subsequent reform activities. We cannot assure you that future healthcare legislation or changes in the administration or implementation of governmental healthcare reimbursement programs will not have a material adverse effect on our
operators’ liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, which could adversely affect their ability to make rental payments to us and which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Medicare Reimbursement; Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals

The BBA mandated the creation of a prospective payment system for long-term acute care hospitals (“LTAC PPS”), which became effective on October 1, 2002 for cost reporting periods commencing on or after
October 1, 2002. All long-term acute care hospitals are required to have transitioned to LTAC PPS, which classifies patients into distinct diagnostic groups based on clinical characteristics and expected resource needs.

Under LTAC PPS, long-term acute care hospitals are reimbursed on a predetermined rate rather than on a reasonable cost basis that reflects costs
incurred. LTAC PPS requires payment for a Medicare beneficiary at a predetermined, per discharge amount for each defined patient category (called “Long-Term Care—Diagnosis Related Groups” or “LTC-DRGs”), adjusted for
differences in area wage levels.

Updates to the LTAC PPS payment rates are published annually for the long-term acute care hospital rate
year (July 1 through June 30). However, annual updates to the LTAC PPS classification system and its relative weighting system (LTC-DRGs) continue to coincide with the federal fiscal year (October 1 through September 30), as with the
prospective payment system for short-term acute care hospitals. These updates are established by regulators each year.



On May 11, 2007, CMS published its final rule updating LTAC PPS payment rates for the 2008 rate year
(July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008). On July 5, 2007, CMS published corrections to the final rule. The corrected final rule makes many technical changes and adjustments to LTAC PPS, including increasing the standard federal payment rate
by 0.71% (which, owing to other changes, will on average represent a 0.6% increase), revising the payment methodologies impacting short-stay outliers, adjusting the wage index component of the federal payment and increasing the high cost outlier
threshold. CMS estimates that, due to these changes and adjustments, payments per discharge are expected to decrease in the 2008 rate year by 1.2% on average, when compared to average payments for the 2007 rate year. The corrected final rule also
expands the so-called “25-percent rule,” which limits payments from referring co-located hospitals, to all long-term acute care hospitals. The 25-percent rule is being phased in over a three-year period, and CMS projects that it will not
result in payment reductions in the first year of implementation. The expansion of the 25-percent rule contained in the corrected final rule could, however, reduce the caseloads or affect the referral patterns of the long-term acute care hospitals
operated by our tenants.

On August 22, 2007, CMS published its final rule to update and reform the inpatient prospective payment
system (“IPPS”) for short-term and long-term acute care hospitals for the 2008 federal fiscal year (October 1, 2007 through September 30, 2008). On October 10, 2007, CMS published corrections to the final rule. The reforms in the
corrected final rule are intended to improve the accuracy of Medicare payments for inpatient acute care. The final rule creates 745 new severity-adjusted diagnosis-related groups (“DRGs”) (Medicare Severity DRGs or MS-DRGs) to replace the
current 538 DRGs. CMS projects that aggregate annual spending from the reforms will not change. However, CMS expects that payments would increase for hospitals serving more severely ill patients and decrease for hospitals serving patients who are
less severely ill.

On September 27, 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the “TMA, Abstinence Education, and QI Programs Extension Act
of 2007,” which was signed into law by President Bush on September 29, 2007. The bill reduced a planned “behavioral offset” to the MS-DRGs to -0.6% from -1.2% in federal fiscal year 2008 and to -0.9% from -1.8% in federal fiscal
year 2009. The changes to the prospective cuts will result in a restoration of Medicare payment cuts to IPPS hospitals of $2.5 billion over the next two years and $7 billion over the next five years, assuming no additional retrospective adjustments
are made. The bill also includes a “lookback” provision, which directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to adjust for hospital overpayments or underpayments if the remaining prospective cuts do not accurately account for real
changes in case mix once the new MS-DRG system is fully implemented by 2010.

On December 29, 2007, President Bush signed into law the
“Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007” (the “Medicare Extension Act”). Section 114 of the Medicare Extension Act is intended to implement the recommendations of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission
(“MedPAC”) to better define long-term acute care hospitals and the patients they treat by using better patient and facility-level criteria. Long-term acute care hospitals must institute a patient review process to better assess patients
upon admission and on a continuing basis for appropriateness of care. CMS medical necessity reviews for long-term acute care hospitals will be significantly expanded. Section 114 of the Medicare Extension Act, among other things, also provides
the following relief from recent long-term acute care hospital payment policy changes:

•

it prevents CMS from applying the 25-percent rule for three years to freestanding and grandfathered long-term acute care hospitals;

•

it modifies the application of the 25-percent rule to certain urban and rural long-term acute care “hospitals-within-hospitals” and “satellite”
facilities for three years;

•

it prevents CMS from applying the “very short stay outlier” policy for three years; and

•

it prevents CMS for three years from making any one-time adjustments to correct estimates used in implementing LTAC PPS.



Lastly, the Medicare Extension Act places a partial-year freeze on long-term acute care hospital rates in the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2008 (from April 1, 2008 through June 30, 2008) and introduces a moratorium on new long-term acute care hospitals and beds for three years.

On January 29, 2008, CMS issued a proposed rule proposing an increase of 2.6% in annual payment rates for the 2009 rate year (proposed as
July 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009). CMS believes this proposal complies with the Medicare Extension Act. The proposed rule includes a 3.5% increase in the hospital market basket index, less a 0.9% adjustment to offset recent coding
behavioral changes. CMS estimates aggregate long-term acute care hospital payments to reach approximately $4.44 billion under the proposed rule, an increase of approximately $124 million over the 2008 rate year. CMS is also proposing to change the
annual rate update back to October 1 to coincide with the annual update to MS-DRG classifications and weights, etc. Accordingly, this 2009 rate year update will be effective for a 15-month period (July 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009).
Lastly, the proposed rule is proposing to increase the fixed-loss threshold amount for high cost outlier cases by 2% to $21,199, from $20,738. The proposed rule is subject to a 60-day comment period.

We cannot assure you that future updates to the LTAC PPS system or Medicare reimbursement for long-term acute care hospitals will not materially
adversely affect our operators, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. See “Risks Arising from Our Business—Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the Medicare and
Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Medicare Reimbursement; Skilled Nursing Facilities

The BBA also established a prospective payment
system for skilled nursing facilities (“SNF PPS”) offering Part A covered services. Under the SNF PPS, payment amounts are based upon classifications determined through assessments of individual Medicare patients in the skilled nursing
facility, rather than on the facility’s reasonable costs. The payments received under the SNF PPS are intended generally to cover all inpatient services for Medicare patients, including routine nursing care, most capital-related costs
associated with the inpatient stay, and ancillary services, such as respiratory therapy, occupational and physical therapy, speech therapy and certain covered drugs. Under the SNF PPS, per diem payments are made to nursing home facilities for each
resident.

In response to widespread healthcare industry concern about the reductions in payments under BBA, the federal government enacted
BBRA on November 29, 1999. BBRA increased the per diem reimbursement rates for certain high acuity patients by 20% starting April 1, 2000 and continuing until case mix refinements were implemented by CMS, as explained below. Under BBRA,
outpatient rehabilitation therapy providers, including Part B nursing facilities, also received a two-year moratorium on the annual cap on the amount of physical, occupational and speech therapy provided to a patient, which moratorium was
subsequently extended until December 31, 2005 pursuant to the Medicare Modernization Act. On January 1, 2006, these therapy limitations went into effect until the DRA was enacted. This new law, signed by President Bush on February 8,
2006, retroactively established an exception process for the payment of all claims above the limits when such services are medically necessary. Under CMS’s final rule updating LTC-DRGs for the 2007 federal fiscal year, the annual cap on
Medicare part B reimbursement for physical therapy and speech-language pathology services and the separate annual cap on occupational therapy were lifted for those patients who can demonstrate medical necessity. On December 20, 2006, the
President signed into law the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, which, among other things, extended the DRA process for obtaining relief from the therapy caps through December 31, 2007. The DRA process was again extended through
June 30, 2008 by Section 105 of the Medicare Extension Act.

In addition, under CMS’s final rule updating LTC-DRGs for
federal fiscal year 2007, reimbursement of uncollectible Medicare coinsurance amounts for all beneficiaries (other than beneficiaries of both Medicare and Medicaid) is reduced from 100% to 70% for skilled nursing facility cost reporting periods
beginning on or after October 1, 2005. CMS estimates that the change in treatment of bad debt will result in a decrease in payments to



skilled nursing facilities of $490 million over the five-year period from federal fiscal year 2006 to 2010. The rule also includes various options for
classifying and weighting patients transferred to a skilled nursing facility after a hospital stay less than the mean length of stay associated with that particular diagnosis-related group. This change in methodology could affect skilled nursing
facility admissions, although we currently cannot predict what impact it will have on the liquidity or profitability of our skilled nursing facility operators.

Pursuant to CMS’s final rule updating SNF PPS for the 2006 federal fiscal year, CMS, among other things, refined the resource utilization groups (“RUGs”) used to determine the daily payment for
beneficiaries in skilled nursing facilities by adding nine new payment categories. The result of this refinement, which became effective on January 1, 2006, was to eliminate the temporary add-on payments that Congress enacted as part of the
BBRA.

On November 1, 2006, the Secretary of Health and Human Services placed on public display his five-year review and update to the
Medicare physician fee schedule entitled: “Medicare Program; Revisions to Payment Policies, Five-Year Review of Work Relative Value Units, Changes to the Practice Expense Methodology Under the Physician Fee Schedule, and Other Changes to
Payment Under Part B; Revisions to the Payment Policies of Ambulance Services Under the Fee Schedule for Ambulance Services; and Ambulance Inflation Factor Update for CY 2007.” This final rule with a comment period was scheduled to be effective
on January 1, 2007. The reduction in fees for physician and therapy services was overturned on December 20, 2006, when President Bush signed into law the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, which, among other things, reduced the
overall payment reduction of 5% to zero.

On August 3, 2007, CMS published its final rule for SNF PPS and Consolidated Billing for
Skilled Nursing Facilities for the 2008 federal fiscal year (October 1, 2007 through September 30, 2008). The final rule, among other things, updates the SNF PPS rates by increasing the market basket by 3.3% and makes various other technical
changes, the economic effects of which have not yet been analyzed. However, the market basket increase provided under this rule can be overridden by Congressional legislation. In addition, the President’s proposed 2009 budget contains
provisions that, if implemented, could reduce or slow the growth in Medicare reimbursement rates for skilled nursing facilities.

We cannot
assure you that future updates to the SNF PPS system, therapy services or Medicare reimbursement for skilled nursing facilities will not materially adversely impact our operators, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. See
“Risks Arising from Our Business—Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and
operators” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Medicaid Reimbursement; Skilled Nursing Facilities

Approximately two-thirds of all nursing home residents are dependent on Medicaid. Medicaid reimbursement rates, however, typically are less
than the amounts charged by the operators of our properties. BBA repealed the “Boren Amendment” federal payment standard for Medicaid payments to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities effective October 1, 1997, giving states
greater latitude in setting payment rates for these providers. Furthermore, federal legislation restricts a skilled nursing facility operator’s ability to withdraw from the Medicaid program by restricting the eviction or transfer of Medicaid
residents.

For the last several years, many states have announced actual or potential budget shortfalls. As a result of these budget
shortfalls, many states have implemented, are implementing or considering implementing “freezes” or cuts in Medicaid rates paid to providers, including hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. Changes to Medicaid eligibility criteria are
also possible thereby reducing the number of beneficiaries eligible to have their medical care reimbursed by government sources.

In the
DRA, Congress made changes to the Medicaid program that are estimated to result in $10 billion in savings to the federal government over five years following enactment of the legislation primarily through the accounting practices some states use to
calculate their matched payments and revising the qualifications for



individuals who are eligible for Medicaid benefits. The changes made by the CMS’s final rule updating SNF PPS for the 2006 federal fiscal year described
above are also anticipated to reduce Medicaid payments to skilled nursing facility operators in the future. In addition, as part of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, Congress reduced the ceiling on taxes that states may impose on
healthcare providers and which would qualify for federal financial participation under Medicaid by 0.5%, from 6% to 5.5%. Nationally, it is anticipated that this reduction should have a negligible effect, affecting only those states with taxes in
excess of 5.5%. We have not yet ascertained the impact of this reduction on our skilled nursing facility operators.

At this time, it is
not possible to predict whether significant Medicaid rate freezes or cuts or other program changes will be adopted and if so, by how many states or whether the U.S. government will revoke, reduce or stop approving “provider taxes” that
have the effect of increasing Medicaid payments to the states, or the impact of such actions on our operators. However, severe and widespread Medicaid rate cuts or freezes could have a material adverse effect on our skilled nursing facility
operators, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Nursing Home Quality Initiative

In 2002, HHS launched the Nursing Home Quality Initiative program. This program, which is designed to provide consumers with comparative information about
nursing home quality measures, rates nursing homes on various quality of care indicators. Since 2002, investigative and enforcement activities regarding nursing home quality compliance has intensified both on the federal and state administrative
levels.

If the operators of certain of our properties are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or superior to
those of their competitors, patients may choose alternate facilities, which could cause operating revenues to decline. In the event the financial condition or operating revenues of these operators are adversely affected, the operators’ ability
to make rental payments to us could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Environmental Regulation

As an owner of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental, health and
safety matters. These laws and regulations address, among other things, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, fuel oil management, wastewater discharges, air emissions, radioactive materials, medical wastes, and hazardous wastes. In certain cases,
the costs of complying with these laws and regulations and the penalties for non-compliance can be substantial. For example, although we do not generally operate or manage our properties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for
costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any property from which there is or has been a release or threatened release of a hazardous or toxic substance and any other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the
release. In addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property’s value, we could be liable for certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons or property. See
“Risks Arising from Our Business—If any of our properties are found to be contaminated, or if we become involved in any environmental disputes, we could incur substantial liabilities and costs” included in Item 1A of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

We are generally indemnified by the current operators of our properties for contamination caused by those operators.
For example, under the Kindred Master Leases, Kindred has agreed to indemnify us against any environmental claims (including penalties and clean-up costs) resulting from any condition arising in, on or under, or relating to, the leased properties at
any time on or after the lease commencement date for the applicable leased property and from any condition permitted to deteriorate on or after such date (including as a result of migration from adjacent properties not owned or operated by us or any
of our affiliates other than Kindred and its direct affiliates). However, we cannot assure you that Kindred or another operator will have the financial capability or the willingness to satisfy any such environmental claims, and in the event Kindred
or another



operator is unable or unwilling to do so, we may be required to satisfy the claims. See “Risks Arising from Our Business—We are dependent on
Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living; Kindred’s or Brookdale Senior Living’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and
other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We have also generally agreed to indemnify certain of our operators against any environmental claims (including penalties and clean-up costs) resulting
from any condition arising in, on or under, or relating to, the leased properties at any time before the lease commencement date for the applicable leased property. We have agreed to indemnify Sunrise against any environmental claims (including
penalties and clean-up costs) resulting from any conditions on our properties managed by Sunrise, unless Sunrise caused or contributed to those conditions.

We did not make any material capital expenditures in connection with these environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances and regulations in 2007 and do not expect that we will have to make any such material
capital expenditures during 2008.

CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

This section summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax considerations that you may consider relevant as a holder of our common stock. It is not tax
advice. The discussion does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular stockholders in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances, nor does it apply to certain types of stockholders that are subject to
special treatment under the federal income tax laws, such as insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations (except to the extent discussed below under “—Treatment of Tax-Exempt Stockholders”), financial institutions, pass-through
entities (or investors in such entities) or broker-dealers, and non-U.S. persons and foreign corporations (except to the extent discussed below under “—Special Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Stockholders”).

The statements in this section are based on the Code, Treasury Regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof. The laws governing
the federal income tax treatment of REITs and their stockholders are highly technical and complex, and this summary is qualified in its entirety by the authorities listed above, as in effect on the date hereof. We cannot assure you that new laws,
interpretations of law or court decisions, any of which may take effect retroactively, will not cause any statement in this section to be inaccurate.

Federal Income Taxation of Ventas

We elected REIT status beginning with the year ended December 31, 1999. Beginning
with the 1999 tax year, we believe that we have satisfied the requirements to qualify as a REIT, and we intend to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not
be subject to federal income tax on net income that we currently distribute to stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” (i.e., taxation at both the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results
from investment in a corporation.

Notwithstanding our qualification as a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on any
undistributed taxable income, including undistributed net capital gains, at regular corporate rates. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax if we do not satisfy specific REIT distribution requirements. See “—Requirements for
Qualification as a REIT—Annual Distribution Requirements.” Under certain circumstances, we may be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our undistributed items of tax preference. If we have (i) net income from the sale
or other disposition of “foreclosure property” (see below) that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or (ii) certain other non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, we will be subject to
tax at the highest corporate rate on such income. See “—Requirements for Qualification as a REIT—



Asset Tests.” In addition, if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” (which are, in general, certain sales or other dispositions of
property (other than foreclosure property) held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business), that income will be subject to a 100% tax.

We may also be subject to “Built-in Gains Tax” on any appreciated asset that we own or acquire that was previously owned by a C corporation (i.e., a corporation generally subject to full corporate level
tax). If we dispose of any of these assets and recognize gain on the disposition of such asset during the ten-year period immediately after the assets were owned by a C corporation (either prior to our REIT election, or through stock acquisition or
merger), then we generally will be subject to regular corporate income tax on the gain equal to the lower of (i) the recognized gain at the time of the disposition or (ii) the built-in gain in that asset as of the date it became a REIT
asset.

In addition, if we should fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test (as discussed below) and
nonetheless have maintained our qualification as a REIT because certain other requirements have been met, we will be subject to a 100% tax on the gross income attributable to the greater of the amount by which we failed the 75% or 95% tests (or, for
our 2001 through 2004 taxable years, a 90% test in lieu of the 95% test), multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability. Further, if we were to violate one or more of the REIT asset tests (as discussed below) under certain
circumstances, but the violation was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and we were to take certain remedial actions, we may avoid a loss of our REIT status by, among other things, paying a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the
highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the non-qualifying asset during a specified period. In addition, if we should fail to satisfy one or more requirements for REIT qualification, other than the 75% and 95% gross
income tests and other than the assets test, but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a REIT because certain other requirements have been met, we may be subject to a $50,000 penalty for each failure. Finally, we will incur a 100% excise tax on
certain transactions with a taxable REIT subsidiary that are not conducted on an arm’s-length basis.

See “—Requirements for
Qualification as a REIT” below for other circumstances in which we may be required to pay federal taxes.

Requirements for Qualification as a REIT

To qualify as a REIT, we must meet the requirements discussed below, relating to our organization, sources of income, nature of assets
and distributions of income to stockholders.

Organizational Requirements

The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association: (i) that is managed by one or more directors or trustees; (ii) the beneficial
ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest; (iii) that would be taxable as a domestic corporation, but for Sections 856 through 859 of the Code; (iv) that is neither a
financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the Code; (v) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of twelve months, or during a
proportionate part of a shorter taxable year (the “100 Shareholder Rule”); (vi) not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to
include certain entities) during the last half of each taxable year (the “5/50 Rule”); (vii) that makes an election to be a REIT (or has made such election for a previous taxable year) and satisfies all relevant filing and other
administrative requirements established by the IRS that must be met in order to elect and to maintain REIT status; (viii) that uses a calendar year for federal income tax purposes; and (ix) that meets certain other tests, described below,
regarding the nature of its income and assets.

We believe, but we cannot assure you, that we have satisfied and will continue to satisfy
the organizational requirements. In order to prevent a concentration of ownership of our stock that would cause us to fail the 5/50



Rule or the 100 Shareholder Rule, we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent such concentration of share
ownership. However, such restrictions may not prevent us from failing to meet these requirements, and thereby failing to qualify as a REIT.

In addition, to qualify as a REIT, a corporation may not have (as of the end of the taxable year) any earnings and profits that were accumulated in periods before it elected REIT status. We believe that we have not had any accumulated
earnings and profits that are attributable to non-REIT periods, although the IRS is entitled to challenge that determination.

Gross
Income Tests

To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two annual gross income requirements. First, at least 75% of our gross income
(excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must consist of defined types of income derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property (including pledges of equity
interest in certain entities holding real property and also including “rents from real property” (as defined in the Code)) and, in certain circumstances, interest on certain types of temporary investment income. Second, at least 95% of our
gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must be derived from such real property or temporary investments, dividends, interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, or from any
combination of the foregoing.

We believe, but we cannot assure you, that we have been and will continue to be in compliance with the gross
income tests. If we fail to satisfy one or both gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for the year under certain relief provisions of the Code. If we were eligible to qualify under the relief provisions, a
100% tax would be imposed with respect to the income exceeding one or both of the gross income tests.

If we fail to satisfy one or both of
the gross income tests and the relief provisions for any year, we will not qualify as a REIT for such year. If we lose our REIT status, it would have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Asset Tests

At the close of each
quarter of our taxable year, we must satisfy the following tests relating to the nature of our assets. First, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by cash or cash items (including certain receivables), government
securities, “real estate assets” (including interest in real property and in mortgages on real property and shares in other qualifying REITs) or, in cases where we raise new capital through stock or long-term (maturity of at least five
years) debt offerings, temporary investments in stock or debt instruments during the one-year period following our receipt of such capital (the “75% asset test”). Second, of the investments not meeting the requirements of the 75% asset
test, the value of any one issuer’s debt and equity securities owned by us (other than our interest in any entity classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, the stock of a taxable REIT subsidiary (as defined below) or the
stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary) may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets (the “5% asset test”), and we may not own more than 10% of any one issuer’s outstanding voting securities (the “10% voting securities
test”) or 10% of the value of any one issuer’s outstanding securities, subject to limited “safe harbor” exceptions (the “10% value test”). In addition, no more than 20% of the value of our assets can be represented by
securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries (the “20% TRS test”).

If we fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of any quarter
other than our first quarter, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a REIT and maintain our REIT status if (i) we satisfied all of the asset tests at the close of the preceding calendar quarter and (ii) the discrepancy between the
value of our assets and the asset test requirements arose from changes in the market values of our assets and was not wholly or partly caused by an acquisition of nonqualifying assets.



Furthermore, if we fail any of the asset tests discussed above at the end of any quarter without curing
such failure within 30 days after the end of such quarter, we would fail to qualify as a REIT, unless we were to qualify under certain relief provisions enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Under one of these relief provisions,
if we were to fail the 5% asset test, the 10% voting securities test or the 10% value test, we nevertheless would continue to qualify as a REIT if the failure was due to the ownership of assets having a total value not exceeding the lesser of 1% of
our assets at the end of the relevant quarter or $10 million, and we were to dispose of such assets (or otherwise meet such asset tests) within six months after the end of the quarter in which the failure was identified. If we were to fail to meet
any of the REIT asset tests for a particular quarter, but we did not qualify for the relief for de minimis failures that is described in the preceding sentence, then we would be deemed to have satisfied the relevant asset test if: (i) following
our identification of the failure, we were to file a schedule with a description of each asset that caused the failure; (ii) the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect; (iii) we were to dispose of the non-qualifying
asset (or otherwise meet the relevant asset test) within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure was identified; and (iv) we were to pay a penalty tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate
multiplied by the net income generated by the non-qualifying asset during the period beginning on the first date of the failure and ending on the date we dispose of the asset (or otherwise cure the asset test failure). It is not possible to predict,
however, whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. We intend to maintain adequate records of the value of our assets to ensure compliance with the asset tests and to take such other actions as may
be required to comply with those tests.

We believe, but we cannot assure you, that we have been and will continue to be in compliance with
the 75% asset test, the 10% voting securities test, the 10% value test, the 5% asset test and the 20% TRS test. If we fail to satisfy any of these tests and the relief provisions, we would lose our REIT status, which would have a Material Adverse
Effect on us.

Foreclosure Property

The foreclosure property rules permit us (by our election) to foreclose or repossess properties without being disqualified as a REIT as a result of receiving income that does not qualify under the gross income tests;
however, a corporate tax is imposed upon such net non-qualifying income from “foreclosure property.” Detailed rules specify the calculation of the tax, and the after-tax amount would increase the dividends we would be required to
distribute to stockholders each year. See “—Annual Distribution Requirements” below.

Foreclosure property treatment will
end on the first day on which we enter into a lease of the property that will give rise to income that is not “good REIT” income under Section 856(c)(3) of the Code. In addition, foreclosure property treatment will end if any
construction takes place on the property (other than completion of a building, or other improvement more than 10% complete before default became imminent). Foreclosure property treatment is available for an initial period of three years and may, in
certain circumstances, be extended for an additional three years. Foreclosure property treatment for qualified healthcare property is available for an initial period of two years and may, in certain circumstances, be extended for an additional four
years.

Taxable REIT Subsidiaries

We are permitted to own up to 100% of a “taxable REIT subsidiary” or “TRS.” A TRS is a corporation subject to tax as a regular C corporation. Generally, a TRS can own assets that cannot be owned by
a REIT and can perform otherwise impermissible tenant services (excluding the direct or indirect operation or management of a lodging or healthcare facility) which would otherwise disqualify the REIT’s rental income under the REIT income tests.
There are certain limits on the ability of a TRS to deduct interest payments made to us. In addition, we will be obligated to pay a 100% penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by the TRS if the economic
arrangements between the REIT, the REIT’s tenants and the TRS are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties.



Annual Distribution Requirements

In order to be taxed as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to our stockholders in an amount at least
equal to (i) the sum of (A) 90% of our “REIT taxable income” (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (B) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property,
minus (ii) the sum of certain items of non-cash income. Such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if (i) they are (A) declared in October, November or December,
(B) payable to stockholders of record on a specified date in any one of these months and (C) actually paid during January of such following year or (ii)(A) they are declared before we timely file our tax return for such year, (B) paid
on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration, and (C) we elect on our federal income tax return for the prior year to have a specified amount of the subsequent dividend as treated as paid in the prior year. To the
extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular capital gains and
ordinary corporate tax rates except to the extent of net operating loss or capital loss carryforwards. If any taxes are paid in connection with the Built-in Gains Tax rules, these taxes will be deductible in computing REIT taxable income.
Furthermore, if we fail to distribute during each calendar year (or, in the case of distributions with declaration and record dates falling in the last three months of the calendar year, by the end of January following such calendar year) at least
the sum of (i) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year (other than long-term capital gain we elect to retain and treat as having been distributed to stockholders), and
(iii) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts actually distributed.

We believe, but we cannot assure you, that we have satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year of our REIT election and each year
thereafter through the year ended December 31, 2007. Although we intend to continue meeting the annual distribution requirements to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the year ending December 31, 2008 and subsequent
years, it is possible that economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may limit our ability to meet such requirements. As a result, if we were not able to meet the annual distribution requirement, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.
Moreover, if we distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income by taking advantage of the “throwback rule” described in clause (ii)(C) of the second sentence of the preceding paragraph, satisfying the REIT distribution requirement and
generally avoiding corporate level tax, we may incur a 4% nondeductible excise tax.

Failure to Continue to Qualify

If we fail to satisfy one or more requirements for REIT qualification, other than an asset or income test violation of a type for which relief is
otherwise available as described above, we would retain our REIT qualification if the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, and if we were to pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. It is not possible to predict
whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of this relief provision.

If our election to be taxed as a REIT is
revoked or terminated (e.g., due to a failure to meet the REIT qualification tests and no relief provisions were to apply), we would be subject to tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate
rates (for all open tax years beginning with the year our REIT election is revoked or terminated) except to the extent of net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards. Distributions to stockholders would not be deductible by us, nor would they
be required to be made. To the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits, all distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary income, and, subject to certain limitations in the Code, corporate stockholders may be eligible for
the dividends received deduction. In addition, we would be prohibited from re-electing REIT status for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT, unless certain relief provisions of the Code applied. It is
impossible to predict whether we would be entitled to such statutory relief.



Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Stockholders

As used herein, the term “U.S. Stockholder” means a holder of our common stock that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is: (i) an
individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision thereof; (iii) an estate the income of which is includible in
gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust with respect to which (A) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust or (B) an election has
been made under applicable Treasury Regulations to retain its pre-August 20, 1996 classification as a U.S. person. If a partnership holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and on
the activities of the partnership. Partners of partnerships holding our stock should consult their tax advisors. This section assumes the U.S. Stockholder holds our common stock as a capital asset.

As long as we qualify as a REIT, distributions made to our taxable U.S. Stockholders out of current or accumulated earnings and profits (and not
designated as capital gain dividends) generally will be taken into account by such U.S. Stockholders as ordinary income and will not be eligible for the qualified dividends rate generally available to non-corporate holders or for the dividends
received deduction generally available to corporations. Distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as a capital gain (to the extent such distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year)
without regard to the period for which the stockholder has held its shares. The tax rates applicable to such capital gains are discussed below. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a
stockholder to the extent that they do not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder’s shares (determined on a share-by-share basis), but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of those shares. To the extent that distributions in excess of
current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a stockholder’s shares, such distributions will be included in income as capital gains. The tax rate applicable to such capital gain will depend on the stockholder’s
holding period for the shares. In addition, any distribution declared by us in October, November or December of any year and payable to a stockholder of record on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by
the stockholder on December 31 of such year, provided that the distribution is actually paid by us during January of the following calendar year.

We may elect to treat all or a part of our undistributed net capital gain as if it had been distributed to our stockholders (including for purposes of the 4% excise tax discussed above under “—Requirements
for Qualification as a REIT—Annual Distribution Requirements”). If we make such an election, our stockholders would be required to include in their income as long-term capital gain their proportionate share of our undistributed net capital
gain, as designated by us. Each such stockholder would be deemed to have paid its proportionate share of the income tax imposed on us with respect to such undistributed net capital gain, and this amount would be credited or refunded to the
stockholder. In addition, the tax basis of the stockholder’s shares would be increased by its proportionate share of undistributed net capital gains included in its income, less its proportionate share of the income tax imposed on us with
respect to such gains.

Stockholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or net capital
losses. Instead, such losses would be carried over by us for potential offset against our future income (subject to certain limitations). Taxable distributions from us and gain from the disposition of our common stock will not be treated as passive
activity income, and, therefore, stockholders generally will not be able to apply any “passive activity losses” (such as losses from certain types of limited partnerships in which the stockholder is a limited partner) against such income.
In addition, taxable distributions from us generally will be treated as investment income for purposes of the investment interest limitations.

We will notify stockholders after the close of our taxable year as to the portions of the distributions attributable to that year that constitute ordinary income, return of capital and capital gain. To the extent a portion of the
distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend, we will notify stockholders as to the portion that is a “15% rate gain distribution” and the portion that is an unrecaptured Section 1250 distribution. A 15% rate gain



distribution is a capital gain distribution to domestic stockholders that are individuals, estates or trusts that is taxable at a maximum rate of 15%. An
unrecaptured Section 1250 gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic stockholders that are individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25%.

Taxation of U.S. Stockholders on the Disposition of Shares of Common Stock

In general, a U.S.
Stockholder who is not a dealer in securities must treat any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of our common stock as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Stockholder has held the shares for more than one year, and otherwise as
short-term capital gain or loss. However, a U.S. Stockholder must treat any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our common stock held for six months or less as a long-term capital loss to the extent of capital gain dividends and any other
actual or deemed distributions from us which the U.S. Stockholder treats as long-term capital gain. All or a portion of any loss that a U.S. Stockholder realizes upon a taxable disposition of our common stock may be disallowed if the U.S.
Stockholder purchases other shares of our common stock within 30 days before or after the disposition.

Treatment of Tax-Exempt Stockholders

Tax-exempt organizations, including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts
(collectively, “Exempt Organizations”), generally are exempt from federal income taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). While many investments in real estate generate
UBTI, the IRS has issued a published ruling that dividend distributions by a REIT to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares of the REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt
employee pension trust. Based on that ruling, and subject to the exceptions discussed below, amounts distributed by us to Exempt Organizations generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an Exempt Organization finances its acquisition of our
common stock with debt, a portion of its income from us will constitute UBTI pursuant to the “debt-financed property” rules. Furthermore, social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and
qualified group legal services plans that are exempt from taxation under paragraphs (7), (9), (17) and (20), respectively, of Section 501(c) of the Code are subject to different UBTI rules, which generally will require them to characterize
distributions from us as UBTI. In addition, in certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns more than 10% of our stock is required to treat a percentage of the dividends from us as UBTI.

Special Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Stockholders

The rules governing U.S. federal income taxation of nonresident alien individuals, foreign corporations, foreign estates and foreign trusts (collectively, “Non-U.S. Stockholders”) are complex, and the following is no more than a
brief summary of those rules. Non-U.S. Stockholders should consult with their own tax advisors to determine the impact of federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax laws with regard to their ownership of our common stock, including any reporting
requirements.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Stockholder” does not include any foreign stockholder whose
investment in our stock is “effectively connected” with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Such a foreign stockholder, in general, will be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to its investment in our stock
in the same manner as a U.S. Stockholder is taxed (subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals). In addition, a foreign corporation receiving income that is treated
as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business also may be subject to an additional 30% “branch profits tax,” unless an applicable tax treaty provides a lower rate or an exemption. Certain certification requirements must be
satisfied in order for effectively connected income to be exempt from withholding.

Distributions to Non-U.S. Stockholders that are not
attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of U.S. real property interests and are not designated by us as capital gain dividends (or deemed distributions of



retained capital gains) will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our current or accumulated earnings and
profits. Such distributions ordinarily will be subject to a withholding tax equal to 30% of the gross amount of the distribution unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates that tax. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated
earnings and profits will not be taxable to a stockholder to the extent that such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder’s shares (determined on a share-by-share basis), but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of
those shares. To the extent that distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a Non-U.S. Stockholder’s shares, such distributions will give rise to tax liability if the Non-U.S.
Stockholder would otherwise be subject to tax on any gain from the sale or disposition of its shares, as described below.

We expect to
withhold U.S. tax at the rate of 30% on the gross amount of any dividends, other than dividends treated as attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests and capital gain dividends, paid to a Non-U.S. Stockholder,
unless (i) a lower treaty rate applies and the required IRS Form W-8BEN evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with us or the appropriate withholding agent or (ii) the Non-U.S. Stockholder files an IRS Form W-8ECI or a
successor form with us or the appropriate withholding agent properly claiming that the distributions are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Stockholder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business.

For any year in which we qualify as a REIT, distributions to a Non-U.S. Stockholder that owns more than 5% of our common shares at any time during the
one-year period ending on the date of distribution and that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of U.S. real property interests will be taxed to a Non-U.S. Stockholder under the provisions of the Foreign Investment in Real
Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”). Under FIRPTA, distributions attributable to gain from sales of U.S. real property interests are taxed to a Non-U.S. Stockholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. business.
Accordingly, a Non-U.S. Stockholder that owns more than 5% of our shares will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a U.S. Stockholder (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the
case of nonresident alien individuals). Distributions subject to FIRPTA made to a Non-U.S. Stockholder that owns more than 5% of our shares also may be subject to 30% branch profits tax in the hands of a foreign corporate stockholder not entitled to
treaty relief or exemption. Under FIRPTA, we are required to withhold 35% of any distribution to a Non-U.S. Stockholder that owns more than 5% of our shares which is or could be designated as a capital gain dividend attributable to U.S. real
property interests. Moreover, if we designate previously made distributions as capital gain dividends attributable to U.S. real property interests, subsequent distributions (up to the amount of such prior distributions) will be treated as capital
gain dividends subject to FIRPTA withholding. This amount is creditable against the Non-U.S. Stockholder’s FIRPTA tax liability. It should be noted that the 35% withholding tax rate on capital gain dividends paid to Non-U.S. Stockholders owning
more than 5% of our shares is higher than the maximum rate on long-term capital gains of non-corporate persons. Capital gain dividends not attributable to gain on the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests are not subject to U.S. taxation
if there is no requirement of withholding.

If a Non-U.S. Stockholder does not own more than 5% of our shares at any time during the
one-year period ending on the date of the distribution, the gain will not be considered to be effectively connected with a U.S. business. As such, a Non-U.S. Stockholder who does not own more than 5% of our shares would not be required to file a
U.S. federal income tax return by receiving such a distribution. In this case, the distribution will be treated as a REIT dividend to that Non-U.S. Stockholder and taxed as a REIT dividend that is not a capital gain distribution (and subject to
possible withholding) as described above. In addition, the branch profits tax will not apply to the distribution.

For so long as our
common stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, the sale of such stock by any Non-U.S. Stockholder who is not a Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder (as defined below) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax (unless the Non-U.S. Stockholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions apply, in which case such gain will be subject
to a 30% tax on a gross basis). A



“Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder” is a Non-U.S. Stockholder who, at some time during the five-year period preceding such sale or disposition,
beneficially owned (including under certain attribution rules) more than 5% of the total fair market value of our common stock (as outstanding from time to time).

In general, the sale or other taxable disposition of our common stock by a Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder also will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if we are a “domestically controlled REIT.” A
REIT is a “domestically controlled REIT” if, at all times during the five-year period preceding the disposition in question, less than 50% in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by Non-U.S. Stockholders. Although we believe
that we currently qualify as a domestically controlled REIT, because our common stock is publicly traded, we cannot assure you that we currently qualify or will qualify as a domestically controlled REIT at any time in the future. If we do not
constitute a domestically controlled REIT, a Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder will be taxed in the same manner as a U.S. Stockholder with respect to gain on the sale of our common stock (subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special
alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals).

Information Reporting Requirements and Backup Withholding Tax

Information reporting to our stockholders and to the IRS will apply to the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and distributions
required to be treated as so paid during a calendar year, and the amount of tax withheld, if any, and to the proceeds of a sale or other disposition of our common stock. Under the backup withholding rules, a stockholder may be subject to backup
withholding at the applicable rate (currently 28%) with respect to distributions paid and proceeds from a disposition of our common stock unless such holder (i) is a corporation, non-U.S. person or comes within certain other exempt categories
and, when required, demonstrates this fact or (ii) provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.
A stockholder who does not provide us with its correct taxpayer identification number also may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS.

Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualifications for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of
any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a U.S. Stockholder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Stockholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Stockholder to a refund, provided that the required
information is furnished timely to the IRS.

As a general matter, backup withholding and information reporting will not apply to a payment
of the proceeds of a sale of our common stock by or through a foreign office of a foreign broker. Information reporting (but not backup withholding) will apply, however, to a payment of the proceeds of a sale of our common stock by a foreign office
of a broker that (i) is a U.S. person, (ii) is a foreign partnership that derives 50% or more of its gross income for certain periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or more than 50% of whose capital or profit
interests are owned during certain periods by U.S. persons, or (iii) is a “controlled foreign corporation” for U.S. tax purposes, unless the broker has documentary evidence in its records that the holder is a Non-U.S. Stockholder and
certain other conditions are satisfied, or the stockholder otherwise establishes an exemption. Payment to or through a U.S. office of a broker of the proceeds of a sale of our common stock is subject to both backup withholding and information
reporting unless the stockholder certifies under penalties of perjury that the stockholder is a Non-U.S. Stockholder or otherwise establishes an exemption. A Non-U.S. Stockholder may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS.



Other Tax Consequences

State and Local Taxes

We and/or our stockholders may be subject to taxation by various states and
localities, including those in which we or a stockholder transact business, own property or reside. The state and local tax treatment may differ from the federal income tax treatment described above. Consequently, stockholders should consult their
own tax advisers regarding the effect of state and local tax laws, in addition to the federal, foreign and other tax laws, in connection with an investment in our common stock.

Possible Legislative or Other Actions Affecting Tax Consequences

You should recognize that our present federal income tax treatment may be modified by future legislative, judicial and administrative actions or decisions at any time, which may be retroactive in effect, and which
could adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in shares of our common stock. The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the
Treasury Department, resulting in statutory changes as well as promulgation of new, or revisions to existing, regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts. We cannot predict the likelihood of passage of any new tax legislation or
other provisions either directly or indirectly affecting us or our stockholders or the value of an investment in our common stock.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

RISK FACTORS

This section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. It does not describe
all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are not material, actually
occur, we could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the value of our securities could decline.

We have grouped these risk
factors into three general categories:

•

Risks arising from our business;

•

Risks arising from our capital structure; and

•

Risks arising from our status as a REIT.

Risks
Arising from Our Business

We are dependent on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living; either of Kindred’s or Brookdale Senior
Living’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required
for us to continue to qualify as a REIT.

We are dependent on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living in the following ways:

•

We lease a substantial portion of our properties to Kindred and subsidiaries of Brookdale Senior Living, and therefore Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living accounted
for a significant portion of our total revenues in 2007 and 2006, and they are expected to continue to be significant sources of our revenues;

•

Since the Kindred Master Leases and our leases with subsidiaries of Brookdale Senior Living are triple-net leases, we depend on Kindred and those subsidiaries to
pay insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses required in connection with the leased properties; and



•

Kindred and certain subsidiaries of Brookdale Senior Living have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and
liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses.

We cannot assure you that Kindred or Brookdale
Senior Living will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us. In addition, any failure by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to effectively conduct
its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in its properties. Any inability or unwillingness by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to satisfy its
obligations under its agreements with us or to effectively conduct its operations could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

We may be
unable to find another tenant or operator for our properties if we have to replace Kindred, subsidiaries of Brookdale Senior Living or any of our other tenants or operators.

We may have to find another tenant or operator for the properties covered by one or more of the Kindred Master Leases or our leases with subsidiaries of
Brookdale Senior Living or any of our other tenants or operators upon the expiration of the terms of the applicable lease or upon a default by Kindred or any of those subsidiaries, tenants or operators. During any period that we are attempting to
locate one or more tenants or operators, there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments on those properties. We cannot assure you that Kindred, subsidiaries of Brookdale Senior Living or any of our other tenants or operators will elect to
renew their respective leases with us upon expiration of the terms thereof, nor can we assure you that we will be able to locate another suitable tenant or operator or, if we are successful in locating such a tenant or operator, that the rental
payments from that new tenant or operator would not be significantly less than the existing rental payments. Our ability to locate another suitable tenant or operator may be significantly delayed or limited by various state licensing, receivership,
CON or other laws, as well as by Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules. We also may incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any such licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. Any such delays, limitations
and expenses could materially delay or impact our ability to collect rent, to obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

We may encounter certain risks when implementing our business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional
seniors housing and/or healthcare-related assets.

We intend to continue to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development
of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare-related assets domestically and internationally, subject to the contractual restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility, our Canadian credit facility and the indentures governing our
outstanding senior notes. Investments in and acquisitions of these properties, including the properties acquired in connection with the acquisition of the assets of Sunrise REIT, entail general risks associated with any real estate investment,
including risks that the investment will fail to perform in accordance with expectations, that the estimates of the cost of improvements necessary for acquired properties will prove inaccurate or that the tenant or operator will fail to meet
performance expectations. In addition, investments in and acquisitions of properties outside the United States would subject us to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, such as currency and tax risks. Any
new development projects that we pursue would also be subject to numerous risks, including risks of construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs, new project commencement risks such as receipt of zoning, occupancy and other
required governmental approvals and permits and the risk of incurring development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion. In addition, we may borrow to finance any investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of,
seniors housing, healthcare-related and/or other properties, which would increase our leverage.

We compete for investment and acquisition
opportunities with entities that have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Our ability to compete successfully for these opportunities is affected by many factors, including our cost of obtaining debt and equity capital at rates
comparable to or better than our



competitors. Competition generally may reduce the number of suitable investment and acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the bargaining
power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding our investment, acquisition and development activities. See “Business—Competition” included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Even if we succeed in
identifying and competing for investment or acquisition opportunities, these opportunities would subject us to the risk that the value of the properties or businesses we invest in or acquire could decrease substantially after such investment or
acquisition, that we might be unable to accurately assess the value of properties or businesses that are not of the type we currently own or that the investment or acquisition would divert management’s attention from our existing business, some
or all of which could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Furthermore, as we continue to implement our business strategy to pursue
investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare-related assets or businesses, we intend to increase the number of operators of our properties and, potentially, our business segments. We cannot
assure you that we will have the capabilities to successfully monitor and manage a portfolio of properties with a growing number of operators and/or manage such businesses.

Our investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare-related properties, making us more vulnerable economically than if our investments
were diversified.

We invest primarily in real estate—in particular, seniors housing and healthcare-related properties.
Accordingly, we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and these risks are magnified by the fact that our real estate investments are limited to properties used in the seniors housing or healthcare industries.
A downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. A downturn in the seniors housing or healthcare industries could negatively impact
our operators’ ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Furthermore, the
healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement in the past have had material adverse consequences on the industry in general, which consequences may not have been contemplated by lawmakers and
regulators. We cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation of healthcare will not have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry, including our tenants and operators. Our ability to invest in non-seniors housing or
non-healthcare-related properties is restricted by the terms of our revolving credit facility and our Canadian credit facility, so these adverse effects may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of real estate or outside
of seniors housing or healthcare.

Our tenants, managers and operators may be adversely affected by increasing healthcare regulation and
enforcement.

We believe that the regulatory environment surrounding the long-term healthcare industry has intensified both in the
amount and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. This is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like Kindred, Brookdale Senior Living and Sunrise.

The extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include, but are not limited to, laws and regulations
relating to licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, and financial and other
arrangements which may be entered into by healthcare providers. Federal and state governments have intensified enforcement policies, resulting in a significant increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other
regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, bars on Medicare and Medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. See “Governmental Regulation—Healthcare
Regulation” included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



If our tenants, managers or operators fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other
requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents,
suffer civil and/or criminal penalties and/or be required to make significant changes to their operations. Our tenants, managers and operators also could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement
action under applicable laws or regulations. In addition, failure of our tenants, managers or operators to comply with the applicable healthcare regulations could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition and the results of
operations of our properties operated or managed by it which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

We are unable to
predict the future course of federal, state and local regulation or legislation, including the Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations. Changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our tenants, managers and
operators, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from
third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators.

Kindred and certain of our other tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. There continue to be various federal and state
legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost-containment measures that limit payments to healthcare providers, such as the proposed rule issued by CMS on January 29, 2008 updating LTAC PPS payment rates for the 2009 rate year and the
President’s proposed 2009 budget that could affect SNF PPS rates. See “Governmental Regulation—Healthcare Regulation” included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, private third-party payors have
continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. We cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services to be provided by Kindred and our other tenants and operators which are currently being reimbursed by
Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial
condition and results of operations of Kindred and certain of our other tenants and operators, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

The properties managed by Sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues, and Sunrise is currently experiencing significant legal, accounting and regulatory difficulties.

Sunrise currently manages 79 of our seniors housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. These properties represent a substantial
portion of our portfolio, based on their original cost, and account for a significant portion of our revenues. According to public disclosures, Sunrise is currently reviewing its strategic alternatives and is experiencing significant legal,
accounting and regulatory difficulties. Sunrise announced that it intends to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 no later than March 17, 2008, although there can be no assurance it will do so. If
Sunrise does not so file, its shares will likely be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. The diversion of Sunrise management and employee attention away from the operation of our properties to the strategic review process and these other
difficulties could adversely affect the performance of our assets, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. We cannot assure you that these issues will not harm Sunrise’s business reputation or its ability to attract and
retain qualified employees and to enlist and maintain residents in our properties, which also could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. In addition, we cannot predict the impact, if any, that the resolution of these uncertainties will have on our
financial condition and results of operations. The failure or inability of Sunrise to satisfy its legal, accounting and regulatory requirements and to pay and perform its obligations could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.



We rely on Sunrise to manage a significant number of our seniors housing communities efficiently and
effectively; Sunrise’s inability to do so could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Although we have various rights as owner
under the Sunrise management agreements, we are relying on Sunrise’s personnel, good faith, expertise, historical performance, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information and judgment to manage a significant number of
our seniors housing communities efficiently and effectively. We are also relying on Sunrise to set resident fees and otherwise operate those properties pursuant to our management agreements and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
Any change in the senior management of Sunrise or any adverse developments in Sunrise’s business and affairs, financial strength or ability to operate our properties efficiently and effectively could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. For
example, we depend on Sunrise’s ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our seniors housing communities. A shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general
inflationary pressures may require that Sunrise enhance its pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel, the costs of which are included in the operating budget for each property. Sunrise may not be able to offset such added
costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. Any increase in these costs or any failure by Sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect the income we receive from these properties. In addition, any inability or
unwillingness on Sunrise’s part to satisfy its obligations under the management agreements it has with us could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

We are exposed to various operational risks, liabilities and claims with respect to our seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise that may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and/or increase our
costs and could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Historically, we have leased our healthcare properties, other than our MOBs, to
healthcare operating companies under triple-net leases, which require the tenants to pay all property-related expenses and to make rental payments to us. As a result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, however, we are now exposed to various operational
risks, liabilities and claims with respect to our Sunrise-managed properties that may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and/or increase our costs, thereby reducing our profitability. These risks include fluctuations in occupancy
levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), rent control regulations, increases in costs of materials, energy, labor and services, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition
of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, professional and general liability claims and the availability and costs of professional and general liability insurance. Any one or a combination of these factors could result in
operating deficiencies at our Sunrise-managed properties, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

We have only limited rights
to terminate our management agreements with Sunrise, and we may be unable to replace Sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed.

We and Sunrise are parties to long-term management agreements pursuant to which Sunrise currently provides comprehensive property management services with respect to 79 of our seniors housing communities. Each
management agreement has a term of 30 years and may only be terminated by us upon the occurrence of an event of default by Sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including the revocation of any licenses or certificates
necessary for operation), subject in each case to Sunrise’s rights to cure deficiencies, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to Sunrise. We can also terminate the management agreement if a pool of properties fails to
achieve a targeted net operating income level over a twelve-month period, other than as a result of a default by Sunrise. Consequently, in order to terminate Sunrise’s management agreement on a single underperforming property, we may be
obligated to sell the property. If we were to exercise this remedy with respect to a large number of our seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise, the dispositions could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.



In the event that our management agreements with Sunrise are terminated for any reason or are not renewed
upon expiration of their terms, we will have to find another manager for the properties covered by those agreements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to locate another suitable manager or, if we are successful in locating such a manager,
that such manager will manage the properties as effectively as Sunrise. Any such inability or lengthy delay in replacing Sunrise as manager following termination or non-renewal of our management agreements could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

We may not be able to realize the intended benefits of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, which could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations.

The Sunrise REIT acquisition poses a number of risks, including the risks that:

•

the acquired properties may not perform as well as we anticipated due to various factors, such as disruptions caused by the integration of operations with us and
changes in economic conditions;

•

because we do not manage the day-to-day operations of the acquired properties, we rely on Sunrise to provide accurate property-level financial results for our
properties in a timely manner; and

•

we may experience greater than expected costs and/or may not realize the expected revenues, cost savings or development opportunities from the transaction within
the expected timeframe, if at all.

If the liabilities we have assumed in the Sunrise REIT acquisition are greater
than expected, or if there are unknown liabilities relating to the Sunrise REIT properties, our business could be materially and adversely affected.

We acquired our ownership interests in many of the Sunrise REIT properties through the acquisition of the entities that own these properties. These entities may be subject to liabilities unknown to us that, if
asserted, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us, such as:

•

liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions;

•

unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with such entities;

•

liabilities, claims and litigation, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to the Sunrise REIT acquisition;

•

claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by such entities; and

•

liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to the Sunrise REIT acquisition.

As a result, we cannot assure you that the Sunrise REIT acquisition will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. Among other things, if
the liabilities we have assumed are greater than expected, or if there are obligations relating to the Sunrise REIT properties of which we were not aware at the time we completed the Sunrise REIT acquisition, our business could be materially and
adversely affected.

Our current and future investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole
decision-making authority, our reliance on our joint venture partners’ financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture
partners.

Through the Sunrise REIT acquisition and our resulting relationship with Sunrise pursuant to a strategic alliance agreement,
we have acquired a 75% to 85% ownership interest in 61 seniors housing communities, with the minority interests in those communities being owned by affiliates of Sunrise. In addition, as of December 31, 2007, we owned seven MOBs though joint
ventures with partners who typically provide management and leasing



services for the properties. These joint ventures involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following:

•

We may share decision-making authority with our joint venture partners regarding major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any
property held jointly thereby, such as the sale or financing of any such property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of any such property, which may prevent us from taking actions that are opposed by our joint venture
partners;

•

Prior consent of our joint venture partners may be required for a sale or transfer to a third party of our interests in the joint venture, which restricts our
ability to dispose of our interests in the joint venture;

•

Our joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which may delay construction or development of a
property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture;

•

Our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to the property that conflict with our business interests and goals, which could
increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property;

•

Disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture, which may result in litigation or arbitration that
would increase our expenses and distract our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and possibly disrupt the day-to-day operations of the property, such as delaying the implementation of important decisions
until the conflict or dispute is resolved; and

•

We may suffer losses as a result of the actions of our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments.

We may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

We currently own twelve seniors housing communities in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and British Columbia. As a result, we are subject to fluctuations
in U.S. and Canadian exchange rates which may, from time to time, have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations. As we increase our international presence through investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, seniors
housing and/or healthcare-related assets outside the United States, we may transact additional business in currencies other than U.S. or Canadian dollars. Although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives (including borrowing in local
currencies) to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Our revenues from the seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise are dependent on private pay sources; Events which adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford our daily resident fees could cause our
occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations to decline.

Assisted and independent living services currently are not
generally reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Accordingly, substantially all of the resident fee revenues generated by our Sunrise-managed properties are derived from private pay sources consisting of
income or assets of residents or their family members. In general, because of the expense associated with building new properties and the staffing and other costs of providing services at these properties, only seniors with income or assets meeting
or exceeding the comparable median in the regions where our properties are located typically can afford to pay the daily resident and care fees. Events such as economic downturns, changes in the housing market or changes in demographics could
adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford these fees. If Sunrise is unable to attract and retain seniors with sufficient income, assets or other resources required to pay the fees associated with assisted and independent living services, our
occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations could decline, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.



Overbuilding in markets in which our seniors housing communities are located could adversely affect
our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability.

Barriers to entry in the assisted living industry are not substantial.
Consequently, the development of new seniors housing communities could outpace demand. If the development of new seniors housing communities outpaces demand for those communities in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may
become saturated. Overbuilding in our markets, therefore, could cause us to experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability.

Termination of resident lease agreements could adversely affect our revenues and earnings.

Applicable regulations governing assisted living communities generally require written resident lease agreements with each resident. Most of these regulations also require that each resident have the right to terminate the resident lease
agreement for any reason on reasonable notice. Consistent with these regulations, the resident lease agreements signed by Sunrise with respect to our properties managed by it generally allow residents to terminate their lease agreements on 30
days’ notice. Thus, Sunrise cannot contract with residents to stay for longer periods of time, unlike typical apartment leasing arrangements with terms of up to one year or longer. In addition, the resident turnover rate in our seniors housing
communities may be difficult to predict. If a large number of resident lease agreements terminate at or around the same time, and if our units remained unoccupied, then our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could
have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Significant legal actions could subject our tenants, managers and operators to increased
operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operation.

Although claims and costs of professional liability insurance seem to be growing at a slower pace, our tenants, managers and operators have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of professional
liability claims in recent years. In addition to large compensatory claims, plaintiffs’ attorneys continue to seek significant punitive damages and attorneys’ fees.

Due to historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability
insurance has been restricted and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain very high. As a result, the insurance coverage of our tenants, managers and operators might not cover all claims against them or continue to be available to them at a
reasonable cost. If our tenants, managers and operators are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, they may be exposed to substantial liabilities.

Kindred insures its professional liability risks in part through a wholly owned, limited purpose insurance company. The limited purpose insurance company
insures initial losses up to specified coverage levels per occurrence with no aggregate coverage limit. Coverage for losses in excess of those per occurrence levels is maintained through unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers up to an aggregate
limit. The limited purpose insurance company then insures all claims in excess of the aggregate limit for the unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers. Kindred maintains general liability insurance and professional malpractice liability insurance
in amounts and with deductibles which Kindred management has indicated that it believes are sufficient for its operations.

Our tenants,
managers and operators, including without limitation, Kindred, that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional
liability through actuarial studies which rely primarily on historical data. However, due to the increase in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of
claims, and we cannot assure you that these tenants’, managers’ and operators’ reserves for future claims will be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. If



the actual cost of claims is significantly higher than the tenants’, managers and operators’ reserves, it could have a material adverse effect on
the results of operations at our properties operated by that tenant, manager or operator, the tenants’, managers’ and operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operation and on their ability to make payments to us or on
our behalf, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Our operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower
statute.

Our operators who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to
combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. See “Governmental Regulation—Healthcare Regulation” included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award
bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. If any of these lawsuits were to be brought against our operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material
adverse effect on the operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operation and on their ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

If any of our properties are found to be contaminated, or if we become involved in any environmental disputes, we could incur substantial liabilities
and costs.

Under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for
costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. Owners of real property may also
face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without
regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. In certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or
former operator of the property. Although we are generally indemnified by the current operators of our properties for contamination caused by them, these indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs. See “Governmental
Regulation—Environmental Regulation” included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We have assumed
substantially all of Provident’s liabilities, including contingent liabilities; If these liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are unknown Provident obligations, our business could be materially and adversely affected.

As a result of our acquisition of Provident in 2005, we have assumed substantially all of Provident’s liabilities, including
contingent liabilities to which Provident succeeded when it acquired the ownership interests in the properties that are currently leased to Brookdale and Alterra. We may learn additional information about Provident’s business and liabilities
that adversely affects us, such as:

•

liabilities for clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions;

•

unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with Provident or the former property owners;

•

liabilities, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to the Provident acquisition, including periods prior to
Provident’s acquisition of the Brookdale and Alterra properties;

•

claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by Provident or the former property owners; and

•

liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to the Provident acquisition, including taxes associated with the acquisition or prior ownership of the Brookdale
and Alterra properties.

As a result, we cannot assure you that the Provident acquisition will be successful or will not,
in fact, harm our business. Among other things, if Provident’s liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are obligations of



Provident of which we were not aware at the time we completed the acquisition, or if the Provident acquisition fails to qualify as a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, it could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Risks Arising from Our
Capital Structure

We may become more leveraged.

As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $3.4 billion of indebtedness. Our revolving credit facility, our Canadian credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes permit us to incur
substantial additional debt, and we may borrow additional funds, which may include secured borrowings. A high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service,
thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to stockholders. A high level of indebtedness could also have the following consequences:

•

potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in
the real estate and/or healthcare industries;

•

potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing for our business strategy; and

•

potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, increasing our cost of
borrowing.

We may be unable to raise additional capital necessary to continue to implement our business plan and to
meet our debt payments.

In order to continue to implement our business plan and to meet our debt payments, we may need to raise
additional capital. The amount of additional indebtedness we may incur is limited by the terms of our revolving credit facility, our Canadian credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes. In addition, adverse economic
conditions may impact the availability of additional funds or could cause the terms on which we are able to borrow additional funds to become unfavorable. In those circumstances, we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital markets
or liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to realize the maximum return on those investments, which could result in adverse tax consequences to us. Moreover, certain healthcare regulations may constrain our
ability to sell assets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the necessary capital to continue to implement our business plan or to meet our debt service obligations, and the failure to do so could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

We have now, and may have in the future, exposure to floating interest rates, which could have the effect of reducing our
profitability.

We receive a significant portion of our revenue by leasing our assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the
rental rate is generally fixed with annual rent escalations, subject to certain limitations. Certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest rate and related payments that vary with the movement of LIBOR, Bankers’
Acceptance or other indexes. The generally fixed rate nature of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our obligations create interest rate risk and can have the effect of reducing our profitability or making our lease and other
revenue insufficient to meet our obligations. The amount of floating rate debt versus fixed rate debt we may incur is not limited.



Risks Arising from Our Status as a REIT

Loss of our status as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our common stock.

If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations
and for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because:

•

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular
corporate rates;

•

we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and

•

unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during
which we were disqualified.

In addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain REIT status.

As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and
would adversely affect the value of our common stock.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex
Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. In
addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes. Although we believe that we qualify as a REIT, we cannot
assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes.

See “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations—Federal Income Taxation of Ventas” and “—Requirements for Qualification as a REIT” included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions.

To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our
stockholders. See “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Requirements for Qualification as a REIT—Annual Distribution Requirements” included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The indentures governing our
outstanding senior notes permit us to make annual distributions to our stockholders in an amount equal to the minimum amount necessary to maintain our REIT status so long as the ratio of our Debt to Adjusted Total Assets (as each term is defined in
the indentures) does not exceed 60% and to make additional distributions if we pass certain other financial tests. However, distributions may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our properties or subsequently acquired properties to
finance investments, acquisitions or new developments.

Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets
to enable us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement. This may be due to the timing differences between the
actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as
principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions also may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement.



In the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater
amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other
property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see “—Risks Arising from Our Capital
Structure—We may be unable to raise additional capital necessary to continue to implement our business plan and to meet our debt payments.” The terms of our revolving credit facility, our Canadian credit facility and the indentures
governing our outstanding senior notes restrict our ability to engage in some of these transactions.

The structure utilized to
implement the Sunrise REIT acquisition may jeopardize our REIT status.

As a REIT, we may not own and operate a healthcare facility
directly, and a taxable REIT subsidiary may not directly or indirectly manage or operate a healthcare facility. We believe (and have been advised by counsel) that a taxable REIT subsidiary may own a healthcare facility if such facility is managed by
an independent eligible contractor. In order to ensure that the Sunrise REIT acquisition does not jeopardize our REIT status, the Sunrise REIT properties were acquired through taxable REIT subsidiaries and are being managed by Sunrise pursuant to
long-term management agreements. We believe that the use of such a structure does not compromise our REIT status. However, if it is determined that this structure jeopardizes our REIT status, such determination could have a Material Adverse Effect
on us.

We may still be subject to corporate level taxes.

Following our REIT election and due to the acquisition of Provident, we are considered to be a former C corporation for income tax purposes. Therefore, we
remain potentially subject to corporate level taxes for any additional Kindred asset dispositions occurring before December 31, 2008. Also, as a consequence of the Provident acquisition, we remain potentially subject to corporate level taxes if
we dispose of any of the Brookdale properties before November 2014.

Properties

Seniors Housing and
Healthcare-Related Properties

As of December 31, 2007, we owned 519 assets: 253 seniors housing communities, 197 skilled nursing
facilities, 42 hospitals and 27 medical office and other properties in 43 states and two Canadian provinces. We believe that the asset type and geographic diversity of the properties makes our portfolio less susceptible to adverse changes in state
reimbursement and regulation and regional economic downturns.

At December 31, 2007, we had mortgage loan obligations outstanding in
the aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion, secured by certain of our properties.



The following table sets forth select information regarding the properties we owned as of
December 31, 2007 for each geographic location in which we own property:



Other Real Estate Investments

As of December 31, 2007, our other real estate investments consisted of three first mortgage loans, secured by four properties, in the outstanding aggregate principal amount of $20.1 million.

Each first mortgage loan accrues interest at a rate of 9% per annum and provides for monthly amortization of principal with a balloon payment
maturity date ranging between April and July 2010. One of these loans is guaranteed by a third party, unrelated to the borrower, and its two principals. The remaining two loans are guaranteed by an affiliate of the borrower and its two principals.

Market Information

Our common stock, par value $0.25
per share, is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “VTR.” The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported on the
NYSE and the dividends declared per share.



As of February 15, 2008, there were 138,311,810 shares of our common stock outstanding held by
approximately 2,979 stockholders of record.

Dividends and Distributions

We pay regular quarterly dividends to holders of our common stock. On February 13, 2008, our Board of Directors declared the first quarterly
installment of our 2008 dividend in the amount of $0.5125 per share, payable on March 28, 2008 to stockholders of record on March 6, 2008. We expect to distribute 100% or more of our taxable net income to our stockholders for 2008.

Our Board of Directors normally makes decisions regarding the frequency and amount of our dividends on a quarterly basis. Because the
Board considers a number of factors when making these decisions, we cannot assure you that we will maintain the policy stated above. Please see “Cautionary Statements” and the risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for a description of other factors that may affect our distribution policy.

Our stockholders may reinvest all or a
portion of any cash distribution on their shares of our common stock by participating in our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, subject to the terms of the plan. See “Note 16

Stock Performance Graph

The following performance graph compares the cumulative total return (including dividends) to the holders of our common stock from December 31, 2002 through December 31, 2007, with the cumulative total
returns of the NYSE Composite Index, the FTSE NAREIT Composite REIT Index (the “All REIT Index”), the FTSE NAREIT Healthcare Equity REIT Index (the “Healthcare REIT Index”) and the Russell 1000 Index over the same period. The
comparison assumes $100 was invested on December 31, 2002 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and assumes reinvestment of dividends, as applicable. We have included the NYSE Composite Index in the performance graph because
our common stock is listed on the NYSE. We have included the other indices because we believe that they are either most representative of the industry in which we compete, or otherwise provide a fair basis for comparison with Ventas, and are
therefore particularly relevant to an assessment of our performance. The figures in the table below are rounded to the nearest dollar.



ITEM 6.

Selected Financial Data

You
should read the following selected financial data in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our
Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as acquisitions, divestitures, changes in accounting policies and other items impact the comparability of the financial
data.

(1)

We consider funds from operations (“FFO”) an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT, and we use the National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO



should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance or as an
alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is FFO indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Funds from Operations” included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated
results of operations and financial condition of Ventas, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us” or “our”). You should read this
discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis will help you understand:

•

Key transactions that we completed in 2007;

•

Our critical accounting policies and estimates;

•

Our results of operations for the last three years;

•

Our liquidity and capital resources; and

•

Our funds from operations.

Key Transactions in

During 2007, we completed the following key transactions:

•

We completed the acquisition of all of the assets of Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust (“Sunrise REIT”) for aggregate consideration of
approximately $2.0 billion. As a result, we acquired a 100% interest in 18 seniors housing communities and a 75% to 85% interest in 59 additional seniors housing communities located in 19 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. In addition, we
assumed all rights and obligations of Sunrise REIT under two fixed price acquisition agreements with Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Sunrise”) and subsequently acquired an 80% interest in two additional
seniors housing communities located in Staten Island, New York and Vaughan, Ontario.

•

We issued and sold 26,910,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our shelf registration statement and received $1.05 billion
in net proceeds from the sale, which we used to redeem and repay the majority of our acquisition facility drawn to acquire the Sunrise REIT assets.

•

We purchased eight medical office buildings (“MOBs”) during 2007 for approximately $150.4 million, seven of which are owned through joint ventures with
three different partners that provide management and leasing services for the properties. We now have MOB investments totaling over one million square feet.

•

Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Kindred”) renewed, through April 30, 2013, its leases covering all 64 healthcare assets
owned by us whose base term would have expired on April 30, 2008.

•

We sold 21 skilled nursing facilities and one hospital to Kindred for $175.0 million in net cash proceeds.

•

We entered into a Cdn $90.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Canadian credit facility”) that bears interest at a fluctuating
“Bankers’ Acceptance” rate per annum plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage, which was 0.75% as of December 31, 2007. In January 2008, we increased the borrowing capacity under this facility to Cdn
$105.0 million.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”), which requires us to make estimates and judgments about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the related disclosures. We base estimates on our experience and on
various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting
would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments
are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant estimates and
judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. For more information regarding our critical accounting policies, please see “Note 2

—

Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include our accounts and the accounts of our
wholly owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities over which we exercise control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings applicable to minority
interests.

Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

Investments in real estate assets are recorded at cost. We account for acquisitions using the purchase method. The cost of the properties acquired is allocated among tangible and recognized intangible assets and
liabilities based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business Combinations.” We estimate fair values of the components of assets and
liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date. Recognized intangibles include the value of acquired lease contracts, management agreements and related customer relationships.

Our method for allocating the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate requires us to make subjective assessments for determining fair
value of the assets and liabilities acquired or assumed. This includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements, land and improvements, ground leases, tenant improvements, in-place tenant leases, above and/or below market leases,
other intangibles embedded in contracts and any debt assumed. Each of these estimates requires significant judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of
operations, as amounts allocated to some assets and liabilities have different depreciation or amortization lives. Additionally, the amortization of value assigned to above and/or below market leases is recorded as a component of revenue, as
compared to the amortization of in-place leases and other intangibles, which is included in depreciation and amortization in our Consolidated Statements of Income included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We estimate the fair value of buildings on an as-if-vacant basis, and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building. We
determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over their estimated remaining useful lives. We determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to
the total value of the asset, internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio. The fair value of in-place leases, if any, reflects (i) above and below market leases, if any, determined by
discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in-place rentals, the resulting intangible asset or liability of which is



amortized to revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods, if applicable, (ii) the estimated value of the
cost to obtain tenants, including tenant allowances, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease, and (iii) an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of
the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period, as if the acquired space was vacant, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease. We also estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships
acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant’s credit quality, expectations of lease renewals with the tenant, and the
potential for significant, additional future leasing arrangements with the tenant. We amortize such value over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases, which would include the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected
renewal periods. The fair value of long-term debt is calculated by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings. Discount rates are approximated based on the rate we estimate we
would incur to replace each instrument on the date of acquisition. Any fair value adjustments related to long-term debt are recognized as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We
periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily consisting of our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” If
indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations and adjust the net book value of leased properties and other
long-lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future cash flows and sales proceeds is less than book value. An impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such determination. Future events could occur which would cause us to
conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. We did not record any impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Loans and Other Amounts Receivable from Third Parties

We evaluate the collectibility of loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on a number of factors, including (i) corporate and facility-level financial and operations reports,
(ii) compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the borrowing or lease agreement, (iii) the financial stability of the applicable borrower or tenant and any guarantor and (iv) the payment history of the borrower or tenant.
Our level of reserves, if any, for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties fluctuates depending upon all of these factors.

Revenue Recognition

Certain of our leases, excluding our master lease agreements with Kindred (the “Kindred Master
Leases”), but including the majority of our leases with Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, which include Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. and Alterra Healthcare Corporation, “Brookdale Senior Living”),
provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. Base rental revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable lease. Income on our straight-line revenue is recognized when
collectibility is reasonably assured. In the event we determine that collectibility of straight-line revenue is not reasonably assured, we establish an allowance for estimated losses. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis results in
recognized revenue exceeding cash amounts contractually due from our tenants during the first half of the term for leases that have straight-line treatment.

Certain of our other leases, including the Kindred Master Leases, provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other contingencies are met. We recognize the increased rental
revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other contingencies are met rather than on a straight-



line basis over the term of the applicable lease. We recognize income from rent, lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria
are met in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) Staff Accounting Bulletin 104: (i) the agreement has been fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have been rendered; (iii) the amount is
fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured.

Resident fees and services are recognized monthly as services
are provided. Move in fees, which are included in resident fees and services, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable lease agreement. Lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are
cancelable by the resident with 30 days’ notice.

Gain on Sale of Assets

We recognize sales of assets only upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser. Payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded
as deposits and classified as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Gains on assets sold are recognized using the full accrual method upon closing when the collectibility of the sales
price is reasonably assured, we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the profit, we have received adequate initial investment from the buyer, and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gains may
be deferred in whole or in part until the sales satisfy the requirements of gain recognition on sales of real estate under SFAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.”

Federal Income Tax

Since we have
elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), prior to the second quarter of 2007 we made no provision for federal
income tax purposes and we will continue to make no provision for REIT income and expense. As a result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, income tax expense or benefit is now being recorded with respect to certain entities which are taxed as
“taxable REIT subsidiaries” under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not under the REIT provisions.

Deferred income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax
returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences
are expected to reverse. An increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and which causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, would be included in the tax
provision when the changes in circumstances and our judgment occurs. Deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or
some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. An increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and which causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred
tax asset, would be included in the tax provision when the changes in circumstances and our judgment occurs.

Recently Issued Accounting
Standards

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes when it is uncertain how an income or expense item should be treated on an income tax return. FIN 48 describes when and in what amount an
uncertain tax item should be recorded in the financial statements and provides



guidance on recording interest and penalties and accounting and reporting for income taxes in interim periods. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The
adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” This statement defines fair value and provides guidance for measuring fair value and the necessary disclosures. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair
value measurements, but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. We adopted SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141(R)
requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to measure the assets acquired, liabilities assumed (including contingencies) and any noncontrolling interests at their fair values on the acquisition date. The statement also requires that
acquisition-related transaction costs be expensed as incurred and acquired research and development value be capitalized. In addition, acquisition-related restructuring costs are to be capitalized only if they meet certain criteria. SFAS
No. 141(R) will be effective for us beginning on January 1, 2009. Early adoption is prohibited. We have not yet determined the impact, if any, the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement is expected to have on our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51.” SFAS No. 160 requires the classification of noncontrolling interests (formerly, minority interests) as a component of consolidated equity. In addition, net income will
include the total income of all consolidated subsidiaries with the attribution of earnings and other comprehensive income between controlling and noncontrolling interests reported as a separate disclosure on the face of the consolidated income
statement. The calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. SFAS No. 160 also addresses accounting and reporting for a change in control of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 will be
effective for us beginning on January 1, 2009. Early adoption is prohibited. This statement is required to be adopted prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which are required to be adopted retrospectively. We
have not yet determined the impact, if any, the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement is expected to have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.



Results of Operations

The tables below show our results of operations for each year and the absolute dollar and percentage changes in those results from year to year (dollars in thousands).

Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006

nm—not meaningful

Revenues

The increase in our 2007 rental income, excluding rental income allocated to discontinued operations, primarily reflects (i) $26.4 million of
additional rent resulting from the annual escalator in the rent paid under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2007 and the Kindred rent reset that was effective July 19, 2006, (ii) $7.6 million in additional rent relating to
the properties acquired during 2007 (excluding the Sunrise REIT properties), (iii) $41.1 million in additional rent relating to the full year effect in 2007 of properties acquired during 2006, and various other escalations in the rent paid on
our existing properties. See “Note 5

—

Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Resident fees and services are a direct result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition and are attributed to the
period from April 26, 2007 through December 31, 2007. See “Note 5

—

Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These amounts consist of all
amounts earned from residents at our seniors housing communities that are managed by Sunrise, including rental fees related to resident leases, extended health care fees and other ancillary service income.

Interest income from loans receivable, which includes amortization of deferred fees, decreased $4.4 million in 2007 primarily due to the repayment
of a bridge loan made in 2006 to affiliates of the seller of the Senior Care properties. The bridge loan bore interest at a rate of approximately 10.4% and was repaid upon consummation of the Senior Care acquisition in November 2006. See
“Note 5—Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We recognized approximately $3.4 million of interest income from this loan during 2006. Additionally,
three of the six first mortgage loans we issued during 2005 were repaid in May 2007, representing a decrease in interest income from loans receivable of approximately $0.8 million.

Expenses

Interest expense included
in discontinued operations was $2.1 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations, increased $65.2 million in 2007 over
2006, primarily due to $71.8 million of additional interest from higher loan balances as a result of our 2007 acquisition and loan activity, partially offset by a $9.2 million reduction in interest from lower effective interest rates. In 2007, we
also recognized a $2.6 million expense for upfront fees on bridge financing related to the Sunrise REIT acquisition. Interest expense includes $5.5 million and $3.3 million of amortized deferred financing costs for the years ended December 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively. Our effective interest rate decreased to 7.0% for the year ended December 31, 2007, from 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to depreciation relating to the properties acquired during 2007 and 2006. Additionally, we incurred amortization expense of approximately $56.1 million
related to in-place lease intangibles from the Sunrise REIT acquisition. See “Note 5

—

Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Property-level operating expenses increased primarily due to the Sunrise REIT acquisition. Property-level operating expenses include all expenses related
to our medical office building operations and all amounts incurred for the operations of our seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise for the period from April 26, 2007 through December 31, 2007, such as labor, food, utilities,
marketing, management and other property operating costs.

The increase in general, administrative and professional fees is due primarily
to increased stock-based compensation and increases in other general and administrative items resulting from our enterprise growth.

In
connection with the rent reset process under the Kindred Master Leases, we incurred approximately $7.4 million of one-time costs which we expensed during 2006. These costs included fees of the final appraisers and third party experts, consulting
fees and legal fees and expenses. No similar costs were incurred during 2007.

During 2006, we were notified by the Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) that it had completed its audit of our 2001 federal tax return with no additional tax being due. Accordingly, we reversed into income a previously recorded $1.8 million tax liability related to uncertainties surrounding the
outcome of this audit. No similar activity occurred during 2007.

The gain on
extinguishment of debt in 2007 represents the purchase of $5.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 7


/


% senior notes
due 2015 in an open market transaction for a discount. The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2006 represents the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the refinancing of our previous secured revolving credit facility during
the second quarter of 2006.



The foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily relates to the Canadian
call option contracts that we entered into in conjunction with the Sunrise REIT acquisition. See “Note 2

—

Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K. No similar contracts were in place for the comparable 2006 period.

Merger-related expenses were incurred in connection with the
Sunrise REIT acquisition and include incremental costs directly related to the acquisition and expenses relating to our lawsuit against HCP, Inc.

Income tax benefit represents a deferred benefit which is due solely to our taxable REIT subsidiaries as a direct result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition. See “Note 12

—

Income Taxes” of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Minority interest, net of tax primarily represents
Sunrise’s share of net income from the Sunrise REIT properties based on its ownership percentage in 61 of our seniors housing communities.

Preferred stock dividends and issuance costs relate to the issuance of 700,000 shares of our Series A Senior Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, all of which were redeemed in May 2007 using the proceeds from
the sale of our common stock. See “Note 5

—

Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Discontinued Operations

The increase in discontinued operations is due to the $3.5 million lease termination fee and the $129.5 million gain on sale of real estate assets
recognized in the second quarter of 2007 resulting primarily from the sale of 22 properties to Kindred. See “Note 6

—

Dispositions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005

nm—not meaningful

Revenues

Rental income included in discontinued operations was $12.5 million and $14.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The increase in our 2006 rental income, including rental income allocated to discontinued operations, reflects the recognition of (i) $11.3 million in additional rent relating to the properties acquired during 2006 ($7.0 million relates to the
Senior Care acquisition), (ii) $58.9 million in additional rent relating to the full year effect in 2006 of properties acquired during 2005 ($46.4 million relates to the Provident Senior Living Trust acquisition), (see “Note

—

Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), (iii) $15 million of rental income resulting from the rent reset under the Kindred Master Leases,
(iv) a $6.8 million increase in rent from Kindred resulting from the 3.5% annual escalator under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2006 (prior to the rent reset) and (v) $1.7 million of additional rental income resulting from
rent escalations on various other properties.



Interest income from loans receivable, which includes amortization of deferred fees, increased $2.0
million in 2006 primarily as a result of a bridge loan issued to affiliates of the seller of the Senior Care properties, which bore interest at a rate of approximately 10.4% during the time the loan remained outstanding. We recognized approximately
$3.4 million of interest income from this loan, which was repaid upon consummation of the Senior Care transaction in November 2006. This was partially offset by a net decrease of $1.7 million from interest income in connection with a $17.0 million
mezzanine loan made to Trans Healthcare, Inc. in 2002, as this loan was repaid in full in March 2006. See “Note 8

—

Loans Receivable” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Expenses

Interest expense includes $3.3 million and $3.9 million of amortized deferred financing costs for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $4.5 million and $5.8
million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations, increased $34.9 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily due to $40.7 million of additional
interest expense due to increased debt to fund acquisitions made during 2006, partially offset by a $5.8 million decrease from lower effective interest rates. Our effective interest rate decreased to 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2006,
from 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the properties
acquired during 2006 and 2005. See “Note 5

—

Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The increase in general, administrative and professional fees is attributable primarily to the expensing of stock options as a result of our adoption of
SFAS No. 123(R), “Share Based Payment,” at the beginning of 2006.

In April 2006, we refinanced our previous $300.0 million
secured revolving credit facility and entered into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, resulting in a loss from extinguishment of debt of $1.3 million primarily related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In
December 2005, we paid off our commercial mortgage backed securities (“CMBS”) loan and incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million primarily related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

In connection with the Kindred rent reset process, we incurred approximately $7.4 million of one-time costs which we expensed during 2006. These costs
included fees of the final appraisers and third-party experts, consulting fees and legal fees and expenses.

During 2006, we were notified
by the IRS that it had completed its audit of our 2001 federal tax return with no additional tax being due. Accordingly, we reversed into income a previously recorded $1.8 million tax liability related to uncertainties surrounding the outcome of
this audit. See “Note 13

—

Commitments and Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As a result of anticipated lower variable rate debt balances due to the payoff of our CMBS loan in December 2005, we entered into an agreement with the
counterparty to our interest rate swap to reduce the notional amount of the swap to $100.0 million, from $330.0 million, for its remaining term in exchange for a payment to the counterparty of approximately $2.3 million. In addition, we
recognized $3.3 million of a previously deferred gain recorded in connection with our 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of a separate interest rate swap.

During 2005, we settled our previously disclosed litigation against Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and received net proceeds of $15.9 million, after payment of expenses in connection with the settlement. See
“Note 15

—

Litigation” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

With $2.0 million of the net proceeds received from the litigation settlement, we established and funded the Ventas Charitable Foundation, Inc. (the “Foundation”) in 2005. The Foundation is used to support charitable and
philanthropic causes important to our employees and to the communities in which we operate.



Discontinued Operations

The decrease in discontinued operations is a result of the sale of one property in 2005 for $9.9 million in net cash proceeds and a recognized net gain on
the sale of $5.1 million. In addition, the tenant paid us lease termination fees of approximately $0.2 million. Discontinued operations in 2005 includes the net income of 23 properties sold, whereas discontinued operations in 2006 includes the net
income from 22 properties sold. See “Note 6

—

Dispositions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Funds from Operations

Our funds from
operations (“FFO”) for the five years ended December 31, 2007 are summarized in the following table:

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate
assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values, instead, have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use
historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, we consider FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT and we use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”)
definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated
partnerships and joint ventures.

FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to
the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow
from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our
consolidated historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Asset/Liability Management

Asset/liability
management is a key element of our overall risk management program. The objective of asset/liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels. The asset/liability management process
focuses on a variety of risks, including market risk (primarily



interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk) and credit risk. Effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute
levels and variability of FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes.

Market Risk

We receive a significant portion of our revenue by leasing our assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. We also earn
revenue from our senior living operations and our real estate loan investments. Our obligations under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our Canadian credit facility are floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly
interest payments vary with the movement in LIBOR and Bankers’ Acceptance, respectively.

The general fixed nature of our assets
subject to long-term triple-net leases and the variable nature of our obligations create interest rate risk. If interest rates were to rise significantly, our lease and other revenue might not be sufficient to meet our debt obligations. In order to
mitigate this risk, in September 2001, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the original notional amount of $450.0 million to hedge floating rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008 (the
“Swap”). The Swap is treated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes and is with a highly rated counterparty on which we pay a fixed rate of 5.385% and receive LIBOR from the counterparty. In December 2003, due to our lower expected
future variable rate debt balances as a result of the sale of ten properties, we reduced the notional amount of the Swap for the period from December 11, 2003 through June 29, 2006 from $450.0 million to $330.0 million. In December 2005,
due to our lower expected future variable rate debt balances as a result of the payoff of our CMBS loan, we further reduced the notional amount of the Swap to $100.0 million for the remaining term of the Swap. See “Note 9

—

Borrowing
Arrangements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There are no collateral requirements under the Swap. As of December 31, 2007, the notional amount of the Swap was $100.0
million, which is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2008.

To highlight the sensitivity of the Swap and our fixed rate debt to changes
in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points (BPS) in interest rates as of December 31, 2007 and 2006:

(1)

The change in fair value of fixed rate debt was due to the assumption of approximately $831.9 million of fixed rate debt as a result of our acquisitions during the year ended
December 31, 2007 and overall changes in interest rates.

N/A—Not applicable.

We paid $0.2 million under the Swap during the year ended December 31, 2007. Assuming that interest rates do not change, we estimate that we will
pay $0.9 million on the Swap during the year ending December 31, 2008.



We had approximately $467.8 million and $284.7 million of variable rate debt outstanding as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in our outstanding variable rate debt from December 31, 2006 is primarily attributable to additional net borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our Canadian
credit facility of $92.3 million and $89.7 million, respectively, and the assumption of additional variable debt from the properties managed by Sunrise totaling $121.4 million as of December 31, 2007, offset by the repayment of $114.8 million
in variable mortgage debt in January 2007 assumed as part of the Senior Care acquisition. The Swap currently effectively hedges $100.0 million of our outstanding variable rate debt. Any amounts of variable rate debt in excess of $100.0 million are
subject to interest rate changes. However, pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants, if interest rates increase on certain debt that we have totaling $98.1 million as of December 31, 2007, our tenant is required to pay us
additional rent (on a dollar-for-dollar basis) in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from the increased interest rates. Therefore, the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in
additional rent due to us from the tenant. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable-rate debt, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2007, interest expense for 2008
would increase by approximately $2.7 million, or $0.02 per common share on a diluted basis. The fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which similar borrowings could be made by us.

We initially acquired eleven seniors housing communities in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and British Columbia as part of the Sunrise REIT
acquisition. In addition, we acquired for a fixed price another newly developed community in Canada in December 2007. As a result, we are subject to fluctuations in U.S. and Canadian exchange rates which may, from time to time, have an impact on our
financial position and results of operations. As we increase our international presence through investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing and/or healthcare-related assets outside the United States, we may also decide to
transact additional business in currencies other than U.S. or Canadian dollars. Although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives (including additional borrowings in local currencies) to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot
assure you that any such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity, on our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and on our ability to make
distributions to our stockholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT.

We may engage in additional hedging strategies in
the future, depending on management’s analysis of the interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate environments and the costs and risks of such strategies. Our market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes.

Credit Risk

As a
result of our spin off of Kindred in May 1998 and the Provident acquisition in June 2005, we have a significant concentration of credit risk with Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, Kindred
accounted for $240.6 million, or 30.8% of our total revenues, and $220.9 million, or 51.6% of our total revenues, respectively, and Brookdale Senior Living accounted for $122.8 million, or 15.7% of our total revenues, and $122.7 million, or 28.6% of
our total revenues, respectively. Accordingly, the financial condition of Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living and their ability to meet our rent obligations will largely determine our rental revenues and our ability to make distributions to our
stockholders. In addition, any failure by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Arising from Our Business—We are dependent on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living; either of Kindred’s or Brookdale Senior Living’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its
agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT” included in Part I, Item 1A
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “Note 4

—

Concentration of Credit Risk” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We monitor our credit risk under our
lease agreements with our tenants by, among other things, (i) reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally, publicly available information regarding tenants, and



information provided by the tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements, and (ii) having periodic discussions with tenants, borrowers and
their representatives.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During 2007, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from a bridge loan, preferred equity issuance, dispositions, common stock offering, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our unsecured revolving
credit facility and our Canadian credit facility. We anticipate that cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, dividends to stockholders and debt amortization. Capital requirements for
acquisitions, however, may require funding from borrowings, assumption of debt from the seller, and issuance of secured or unsecured long-term debt or other securities.

The $28.3 million of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2007 consists primarily of cash related to our seniors housing communities that is deposited and held in property-level accounts. Funds
maintained in the property-level accounts are used primarily for the payment of property-level expenses and certain capital expenditures. Our ownership share of property-level cash in excess of stipulated amounts set forth in the Sunrise management
agreements is currently being distributed to us monthly.

We intend to continue to fund future investments through cash flows from
operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, assumption of indebtedness, disposition of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and issuance of secured or unsecured long-term debt or other
securities. As of December 31, 2007, we had escrow deposits and restricted cash of $54.1 million and unused credit availability of $446.0 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility and Cdn $0.9 million under the Canadian credit
facility.

Revolving Credit Facilities

Our unsecured revolving credit facility borrowing capacity is $600.0 million. Generally, borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating LIBOR-based rate per annum
plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage. The applicable percentage was 0.75% at December 31, 2007.

On
July 27, 2007, we amended our unsecured revolving credit facility to include a $150.0 million “accordion” feature that permits us to expand our borrowing capacity to a total of $750.0 million upon satisfaction of certain conditions.
Pricing under the unsecured revolving credit facility did not change and we did not record any material expenses or charges in connection with the amendment.

On August 24, 2007, we entered into the Canadian credit facility. Generally, borrowings outstanding under the Canadian credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating “Bankers’ Acceptance” rate per
annum plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage. As of December 31, 2007, the applicable percentage was 0.75%.

On January 24, 2008, we amended the Canadian credit facility to expand our borrowing capacity to a total of Cdn $105.0 million. We also extended the original maturity date from February 24, 2008 to May 24, 2008. We may
further extend the maturity date for an additional three months subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.

Convertible Senior
Notes

In December 2006, we completed the offering of $230.0 million aggregate
principal amount of our 3


/


% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 (the “Convertible Notes”). The Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holder (i) prior to September 15, 2011, upon the occurrence of specified events and (ii) on
or after September 15, 2011, at any time prior to the close of business on the second business day prior to the stated



maturity, in each case into cash up to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes and cash or shares of our common stock, at our election, in respect of
any conversion value in excess of the principal amount at an initial conversion rate of 22.1867 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which equates to an initial conversion price of approximately $45.07 per share). The conversion rate is
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including the payment of a quarterly dividend in excess of $0.395 per share. As of December 31, 2007, the adjusted conversion rate was 22.3615 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which
equates to a conversion price of approximately $44.72 per share). To the extent the market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price, our earnings per share will be diluted.

Pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the Convertible Notes offering, we filed a registration statement covering
resales by the holders of shares of our common stock, if any, issued upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. We will not receive any proceeds in connection with any such resales.

As of December 31, 2007, $230.0 million principal amount of Convertible Notes were outstanding. Certain of our subsidiaries have fully and
unconditionally guaranteed the Convertible Notes.

Senior Notes Offerings

In September 2006, we completed the offering of $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of


/


% Senior Notes due 2017
(the “2017 Senior Notes”) of Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership and Ventas Capital Corporation (collectively, the “Issuers”) at a 5/8% discount to par value.

In December 2005, we completed the offering of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of


/


% Senior Notes due 2016
(the “2016 Senior Notes”) of the Issuers at a 1/2% discount to par value.

In June 2005, we completed the offering of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6


/


% Senior Notes due 2010 (the “2010 Senior Notes”) of the Issuers, and $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7


/


% Senior Notes due 2015 (the “2015 Senior Notes”)
of the Issuers. In June 2005, we also completed the offering of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6


/


% Senior Notes due 2014 (the “2014 Senior Notes”) of the Issuers, which was in addition to the $125.0 million aggregate
principal amount of 2014 Senior Notes originally issued in October 2004. The additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Senior Notes was issued at a 1% discount to par value. The additional $50.0 million aggregate principal
amount and the original $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Senior Notes are governed by the same indenture. On August 3, 2007, we purchased $5.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 2015 Senior Notes in an open market
transaction.

Pursuant to registration rights agreements entered into in connection with the 2010 Senior Notes, 2015
Senior Notes and additional 2014 Senior Notes offerings, on October 28, 2005, we completed offers to exchange the 2010 Senior Notes, 2015 Senior Notes and additional 2014 Senior Notes with new series of notes that are registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and are otherwise substantially identical to the original 2010 Senior Notes, 2015 Senior Notes and 2014 Senior Notes, except that certain transfer restrictions, registration rights
and liquidated damages do not apply to the new notes. We did not receive any additional proceeds in connection with the exchange offers.

Pursuant to the registration rights agreements entered into in connection with the 2016 Senior Notes offerings, on April 7, 2006, we completed an offer to exchange the 2016 Senior Notes with a new series of notes that are registered
under the Securities Act and are otherwise substantially identical to the original 2016 Senior Notes, except that certain transfer restrictions, registration rights and liquidated damages do not apply to the new notes. We did not receive any
additional proceeds in connection with the exchange offer.

As of December 31,
2007, $174.2 million principal amount of 8


/


% Senior Notes due 2009 (the “2009 Senior Notes”) of the Issuers, $175.0
million principal amount of 2010 Senior Notes, $191.8 million principal amount of 9% Senior Notes due 2012 (the “2012 Senior Notes”) of the Issuers, $175.0 million principal amount



of 2014 Senior Notes, $170.0 million principal amount of 2015 Senior Notes, $200.0 million principal amount of 2016 Senior Notes and $225.0 million principal
amount of the 2017 Senior Notes (collectively, the “Senior Notes”) were outstanding. We and certain of our subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Senior Notes.

The agreements governing our revolving credit facilities, the Senior Notes and the Convertible Notes subject us to a number of restrictive covenants. See
“Note 9—Borrowing Arrangements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Dividends

In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our
stockholders of at least 90% of REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain). We declared dividends greater than 100% of estimated taxable income for 2007 and intend to pay a dividend greater than 100% of taxable income for 2008.

We expect that REIT taxable income will be less than cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non-cash deductions in computing REIT
taxable income. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid
assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. If we do not have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the
90% distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us
to meet the REIT distribution requirements.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures to maintain and improve our triple-net leased properties generally will be incurred by our tenants. Accordingly, we do not believe
that we will incur any major expenditures in connection with these triple-net leased properties. After the terms of the triple-net leases expire, or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under the triple-net
leases, we anticipate that any expenditures relating to the maintenance of these triple-net leased properties for which we may become responsible will be funded by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings. With respect to our
senior living communities managed by Sunrise and our MOBs, we believe that capital expenditures will be funded by the cash flows from the properties or through additional borrowings. To the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant
borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. Our ability to borrow funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of our revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes.

Equity Offerings

In
May 2007, we completed the sale of 26,910,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our current shelf registration statement. We received $1.05 billion in net proceeds from the sale, which we used along with the
proceeds of the disposition of the Kindred assets (see “Note 6

—

Dispositions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and borrowings under our unsecured revolving
credit facility to redeem all of our outstanding Series A Senior Preferred Stock and to repay our indebtedness under the senior interim loan used to fund a portion of the Sunrise REIT acquisition.

Our automatic universal shelf registration statement, filed with the Commission in April 2006, relates to the sale, from time to time, of an
indeterminate amount of debt securities and related guarantees, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. The registration statement replaced our previous universal shelf registration statement, under which approximately $500.0
million of securities remained available for offering.



In July 2005, we completed the sale of 3,247,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public
offering pursuant to our previous shelf registration statement. We received $97.0 million in net proceeds from the sale, which we used to repay indebtedness under our previous secured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes,
including the funding of acquisitions.

In February 2008, we completed the sale of 4,485,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten
public offering pursuant to our current shelf registration statement. We received $191.9 million in net proceeds, before expenses but after the underwriting discount, from the sale, which we used in part to repay indebtedness and will use for
working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to fund future acquisitions, if any.

Other

During 2007 and 2006, we assumed facility-level mortgage debt in connection with certain property acquisitions, including the Sunrise REIT and Senior Care
acquisitions. See “Note 5

—

Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Outstanding facility-level mortgage debt was approximately $1.6 billion and $734.0
million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

We received proceeds on the exercises of stock options in the amounts of
$9.8 million and $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Future proceeds on the exercises of stock options will be primarily affected by the future performance of our stock price and the number of
options outstanding. Options outstanding have decreased to 950,395 as of December 31, 2007, from 1,156,051 as of December 31, 2006.

We generated net proceeds from our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan of $1.1 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In March 2005, we began offering a 1% discount on the
purchase price of our stock to shareholders who reinvest their dividends and/or make optional cash purchases of common stock through the plan. Each month or quarter, as applicable, we may lower or eliminate the discount without prior notice, thereby
affecting the future proceeds that we receive from this plan.

We have outstanding loans made at various times from 1998 through 2002 to
certain current and former executive officers in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.1 million as of December 31, 2007, down from $2.5 million at December 31, 2006. The loans are payable over ten years beginning, in each
case, on the date such loan was made. See “Note 17

Related Party Transactions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Cash Flows

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $399.8 million and $238.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The increase is due to FFO that was higher for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of our real estate acquisitions (primarily the Sunrise REIT acquisition), rent escalations in our leases with tenants and additional
rent resulting from the rent reset under the Kindred Master Leases, and changes in operating assets and liabilities at December 31, 2007.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion and $482.0 million for the
years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These activities consisted primarily of our investments in real estate, offset by proceeds from our mortgage loans, the sale of securities and the sale of assets during the applicable
periods. The increase from 2006 is due primarily to the Sunrise REIT acquisition.



Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $805.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Proceeds primarily consisted of
$1.2 billion in bridge financing, $1.05 billion from the issuance of common stock, $176.6 million of net borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility and our Canadian credit facility and $53.8 million from the issuance of other debt. The
uses primarily included (i) $1.2 billion for repayment of the bridge financing, (ii) $286.2 million of cash dividend payments to common and preferred stockholders and (iii) $184.6 million of aggregate principal payments on
mortgage obligations.

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $242.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, down
from $389.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The proceeds included $449.0 million from the issuance of Senior Notes, Convertible Notes and other debt and $7.5 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock
options and from our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. The uses primarily included (i) aggregate principal payments on mortgage obligations of $16.1 million, (ii) $160.6 million of cash dividend payments,
(iii) payments of deferred financing costs of $4.9 million associated with the issuance of Senior Notes and (iv) net change in borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility and our previous secured revolving credit facility of
$32.2 million.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes the effect that minimum debt (which includes principal and interest payments) and other material noncancelable commitments are expected to have on our cash flow in future periods as of December 31, 2007.

(1)

Amounts represent contractual amounts due, including interest.

(2)

Interest on variable rate debt and obligations under our interest rate swap were based on forward rates obtained as of December 31, 2007.

(3)

Includes commitments for the purchase of one seniors housing community that closed in January 2008 and one surgery center/MOB that is currently expected to close in the second
quarter of 2008.

(4)

Includes outstanding principal amounts of $174.2 million of the 2009 Senior Notes and $149.3 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in 2009 (with an
option to extend for one year subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions).

(5)

Includes outstanding principal amounts of $175.0 million of the 2010 Senior Notes and $230.0 million of the Convertible Notes.

(6)

Includes outstanding principal amounts of $191.8 million of the 2012 Senior Notes, $175.0 million of the 2014 Senior Notes, $170.0 million of the 2015 Senior Notes, $200.0 million
of the 2016 Senior Notes and $225.0 million of the 2017 Senior Notes.

As of December 31, 2007, we had $9.4 million of
unrecognized tax benefits under the provisions of FIN 48 that have been excluded from the table above, as we are unable to make a reasonable reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authority.

In connection with the Kindred spin off, we assigned our former third-party lease obligations and third-party guarantee agreements to Kindred. As of
December 31, 2007, we believe that the aggregate exposure under our



third-party lease obligations was approximately $16.0 million and that we have no material exposure under the third-party guarantee agreements. Kindred has
agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against all claims against us arising out of the third-party leases, and we do not expect to incur any liability under those leases. However, we cannot assure you that Kindred will have sufficient
assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy, or that it will continue to honor its obligations under the indemnity agreement relating to the third-party leases. See “Note 13

MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Ventas, Inc. (the
“Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Management, with the participation of the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management has determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 was effective.

On April 26, 2007, the Company acquired Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust (“Sunrise REIT”). As a result of
the Sunrise REIT acquisition, the Company is party to management agreements with Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (“Sunrise”) pursuant to which Sunrise provides comprehensive accounting and property management services for each of the Sunrise
REIT properties, as well as two additional properties the Company acquired subsequent to the Sunrise REIT acquisition (collectively, the “Sunrise Properties”). As permitted under Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines, the Company
excluded from the assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, internal control over financial reporting of the Sunrise Properties’ assets and operations. Net assets and total
revenues related to the Sunrise Properties represented 38.1% and 36.6%, respectively, of the Company’s related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by Ernst & Young
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Stockholders and Board of Directors

Ventas, Inc.

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ventas, Inc. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2007. Our audits also include the financial statement schedule listed in the index. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of Ventas, Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Ventas, Inc. at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006 Ventas, Inc. changed its method of accounting for
stock-based compensation.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Ventas,
Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February 27, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Stockholders and Board of Directors

Ventas, Inc.

We have audited Ventas,
Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). Ventas, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and
conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include internal control over financial reporting of the Sunrise Properties’ assets and operations, which is included in the 2007 consolidated financial
statements of Ventas, Inc. and constituted 38.1% and 36.6%, of net assets and total revenues, respectively, of the Company’s related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting of Ventas, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Sunrise Properties’ assets and operations.

In our opinion, Ventas, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO
criteria.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
balance sheets of Ventas, Inc. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the



related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. Our
audits also include the financial statement schedule listed in the index. Our report dated February 27, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1—Description of Business

Ventas, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us” or
“our”) is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) with a geographically diverse portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare-related properties in the United States and Canada. As of December 31, 2007, this portfolio
consisted of 519 assets: 253 seniors housing communities, 197 skilled nursing facilities, 42 hospitals and 27 medical office and other properties in 43 states and two Canadian provinces, including 77 seniors housing communities we acquired from
Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust (“Sunrise REIT”) on April 26, 2007. See “Note 5

—

Acquisitions.” With the exception of our medical office buildings (“MOBs”) and 79 of our seniors
housing communities that are managed by Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Sunrise”) pursuant to long-term management agreements, we lease these properties to healthcare operating companies under
“triple-net” or “absolute net” leases, which require the tenants to pay all property-related expenses. Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Kindred”) leased 203 of our properties and Brookdale
Senior Living Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, which include Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. (“Brookdale”) and Alterra Healthcare Corporation (“Alterra”), “Brookdale Senior Living”) leased 83 of our properties
as of December 31, 2007. We also had real estate loan investments relating to seniors housing and healthcare-related third parties as of December 31, 2007.

We conduct substantially all of our business through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership (“Ventas Realty”), PSLT OP, L.P. and Ventas SSL, Inc., and ElderTrust Operating Limited
Partnership (“ETOP”), in which we own substantially all of the partnership units. Our primary business consists of financing, owning and leasing seniors housing and healthcare-related properties and leasing or subleasing those properties
to third parties or operating those properties through independent third party managers.

Note 2—Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities over which we exercise control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation, and net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings applicable to minority interests.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of rental revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

Investments in real estate assets are recorded at cost. We account for acquisitions using the purchase method. The cost of the properties acquired is
allocated among tangible and recognized intangible assets and liabilities based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business
Combinations.” We estimate fair values of the components of assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date. Recognized intangibles include the value of acquired lease contracts, management agreements and related customer
relationships.

Our method for determining fair value varies with the categorization of the asset or liability acquired. We estimate the
fair value of buildings on an as-if-vacant basis, and depreciate the building value over the



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

estimated remaining life of the building. We determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value
over their estimated remaining useful lives. We determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset, internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within
our portfolio. The fair value of in-place leases, if any, reflects (i) above and below market leases, if any, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in-place rentals, the resulting intangible
asset or liability of which is amortized to revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods, if applicable, (ii) the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants, including tenant allowances, tenant
improvements and leasing commissions, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease, and (iii) an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable
lease-up period, as if the acquired space was vacant, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease. We also estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing
business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant’s credit quality, expectations of lease renewals with the tenant, and the potential for significant, additional future leasing
arrangements with the tenant. We amortize such value over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases, which would include the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected renewal periods. The fair value of long-term debt is
calculated by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings. Discount rates are approximated based on the rate we estimate we would incur to replace each instrument on the date of
acquisition. Any fair value adjustments related to long-term debt are recognized as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument.

Fixtures and equipment, with a net book value of $113.6 million and $108.8 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, is included in net real estate property on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Depreciation is recorded on the straight-line basis, using estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and three to ten years for fixtures and equipment. Depreciation is discontinued when a property is
identified as held for sale.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily consisting of our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators in accordance with SFAS
No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash
flows of the underlying operations. We adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long-lived assets to fair value, if the sum of the expected future cash flows and sales proceeds is less than book value. An impairment loss is
recognized at the time we make any such determination. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. We did not record any impairment charges for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Loans and Other Amounts Receivable from Third Parties

Loans receivable are stated at the unpaid principal balance net of any deferred origination fees. Net deferred origination fees are comprised of loan fees
collected from the borrower net of certain direct costs. Net deferred origination fees are amortized over the contractual life of the loan using the level yield method. Interest income on the loans receivable is recorded as earned. We evaluate the
collectibility of loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on, a number of factors, including (i) corporate and facility-level financial and operational reports, (ii) compliance with the financial covenants set forth in
the borrowing or lease agreement, (iii) the financial stability of the applicable borrower or tenant and any guarantor and (iv) the payment history of



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

the borrower or tenant. Our level of reserves, if any, for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties fluctuates depending upon all of these
factors. No reserves were recorded against our loans receivable balance at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity date of three months or less when purchased. These investments
are stated at cost which approximates fair value.

Escrow Deposits and Restricted Cash

Escrow deposits consist of amounts held by us or lenders to provide for future real estate tax and insurance expenditures and tenant improvements related
to our operations and properties. Restricted cash represents amounts paid to us for security deposits and other purposes.

Deferred
Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs are amortized as a component of interest expense over the terms of the related borrowings
using a method that approximates a level yield, and are net of accumulated amortization of approximately $13.5 million and $7.5 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Amortized costs of approximately $5.5 million, $3.3 million and
$3.9 million were included in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Marketable
Equity Securities

We record marketable equity securities as available-for-sale in accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” These securities are recorded at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in stockholder’s equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method and reported in interest and other income on our Consolidated Statements of Income. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and
2006, we realized gains related to the sale of various equity securities of $0.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively. There were no gains or losses realized for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Derivative Instruments

We use
derivative instruments to protect against the risk of interest rate movements on future cash flows under our variable rate debt agreements and the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements. In accordance with SFAS No. 133
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, derivative instruments are reported at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized as adjustments to net
income if the derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting. If the derivative is deemed to be eligible for hedge accounting, such changes are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, exclusive of ineffectiveness amounts, which are
recognized as adjustments to net income. As of December 31, 2007, a $0.5 million net unrealized loss on our interest rate swap is included in accumulated other comprehensive income.

In January 2007, we entered into two Canadian call options in conjunction with our agreement to acquire the assets of Sunrise REIT. See “Note

—

Acquisitions.” We paid an aggregate purchase price of $8.5 million for these contracts, which had an aggregate notional call amount of Cdn $750.0 million at a Cdn $1.18 strike price.



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

These contracts were settled on April 26, 2007, the acquisition date, and we received cash of $33.2 million upon settlement. For the year ended
December 31, 2007, we recognized gains related to these call option contracts of $24.7 million, which is included in our Consolidated Statements of Income as a foreign currency gain.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating fair value disclosures for financial instruments.

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates fair value because of the short
maturity of these instruments.

•

Loans receivable: The fair value of loans receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current interest rates at which similar loans would
be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.

•

Notes receivable-related parties: The fair value of the notes receivable-related parties is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates
being offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings.

•

Interest rate swap agreement: The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is based on rates being offered for similar arrangements which consider forward
yield curves and discount rates.

•

Senior notes payable and other debt: The fair values of borrowings under fixed rate agreements are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current
interest rates at which similar borrowings could be made by us.

Revenue Recognition

Certain of our leases, excluding our master lease agreements with Kindred (the “Kindred Master Leases”) but including the majority of our leases
with Brookdale Senior Living, provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. Base rental revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the applicable lease. Income on our straight-line revenue
is recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured. In the event we determine that collectibility of straight-line revenue is not reasonably assured, we establish an allowance for estimated losses. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line
basis results in recognized revenue exceeding cash amounts contractually due from our tenants during the first half of the term for leases that have straight-line treatment. The cumulative excess is included in other assets, net of allowances, on
our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $54.5 million and $37.1 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Certain of
our other leases, including the Kindred Master Leases, provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other contingencies are met. We recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the
revenue parameters or other contingencies are met rather than on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable lease. We recognize income from rent, lease termination fees and other income when all of the following criteria are met in
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) Staff Accounting Bulletin 104: (i) the agreement has been fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have been rendered; (iii) the amount is fixed or
determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured.

Resident fees and services are recognized monthly as services are
provided. Move-in fees, which are included in resident fees and services, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable lease agreement. Lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are cancelable
by the resident with 30 days’ notice.

Stock-Based Compensation

In December
2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), which is a revision to SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (“SFAS No. 123”). SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB Opinion No. 25”). Generally, the approach
in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123, except that SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement
based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under SFAS No. 123(R). We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. See “Note 11

—

Stock-Based Compensation.”

Gain on Sale of Assets

We recognize
sales of assets only upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser. Payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits and classified as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains on assets sold are
recognized using the full accrual method upon closing when the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured, we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the profit, we have received adequate initial
investment from the buyer, and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gains may be deferred in whole or in part until the sales satisfy the requirements of gain recognition on sales of real estate under SFAS No. 66,
“Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.”

Federal Income Tax

Since we have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), prior to the second quarter of 2007 we made no provision for federal income tax purposes and we will continue to make no provision for REIT income and expense. As a result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition,
income tax expense or benefit is now being recorded with respect to certain entities which are taxed as “taxable REIT subsidiaries” under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not under the REIT provisions.

Deferred income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. An increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and which causes a
change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, would be included in the tax provision when the changes in circumstances and our judgment occurs. Deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. An increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in
circumstances, and which causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset, would be included in the tax provision when the changes in circumstances and our judgment occurs.

Discontinued Operations

The results
of operations and gain or loss on assets sold or held for sale are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Interest expense allocated to discontinued operations has been estimated
based on a proportional allocation of rental income among all of our properties.



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Foreign Currency

Certain of our
subsidiaries’ functional currencies are the local currencies of their respective countries. We translate the results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using average rates of exchange in effect during the period,
whereas balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Resulting currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders’ equity, in
our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Transaction gains and losses are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Segment Reporting

As of December 31, 2007, we operated through two reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties and senior living
operations. Our triple-net leased properties segment consists of financing, owning and leasing seniors housing and healthcare-related properties in the United States and leasing or subleasing those properties to healthcare operating companies under
“triple-net” or “absolute-net” leases, which require the tenants to pay all property-related expenses. Our senior living operations segment consists of investments in seniors housing communities located in the United States and
Canada for which we engage Sunrise to manage the operations.

We acquired the senior living operations segment on April 26, 2007,
pursuant to the purchase of the Sunrise REIT properties. With the addition of these properties, we believed segment differentiation would be appropriate based on the different economic and legal structures used to acquire and own those assets. Prior
to the acquisition, we operated through one reportable segment—investment in real estate—which included the triple-net leased properties and our MOBs. Our MOB segment consists of leasing space primarily to physicians and other
healthcare-related businesses and engaging third parties to manage those operations. Due to our limited operation of and allocation of capital to the MOBs, we separated them from the triple-net leased properties segment. However, the MOB segment is
not individually reported and is included in “All Other” because it does not meet the quantitative thresholds of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information” at the current time. See
“Note 19—Segment Information.”

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies
the accounting for income taxes when it is uncertain how an income or expense item should be treated on an income tax return. FIN 48 describes when and in what amount an uncertain tax item should be recorded in the financial statements and provides
guidance on recording interest and penalties and accounting and reporting for income taxes in interim periods. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. See “Note 12—Income Taxes.”

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” This statement defines fair value and provides guidance for
measuring fair value and the necessary disclosures. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. We adopted SFAS
No. 157 on January 1, 2008. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December
2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to measure the assets acquired, liabilities assumed (including contingencies) and any
noncontrolling interests at their fair values on the acquisition date. The statement also requires that acquisition-related transaction costs be expensed as incurred and acquired research and development value be capitalized. In addition,
acquisition-related restructuring costs are to be capitalized

only if they meet certain criteria. SFAS No. 141(R) will be effective for us beginning on January 1, 2009. Early adoption is prohibited.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51.” SFAS No. 160 requires the classification of noncontrolling interests (formerly, minority interests) as a component of consolidated equity. In addition, net income will include the total income of
all consolidated subsidiaries with the attribution of earnings and other comprehensive income between controlling and noncontrolling interests reported as a separate disclosure on the face of the consolidated income statement. The calculation of
earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. SFAS No. 160 also addresses accounting and reporting for a change in control of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 will be effective for us beginning on
January 1, 2009. Early adoption is prohibited. This statement is required to be adopted prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which are required to be adopted retrospectively.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Note 3—Revenues from Properties

Triple-Net Leased Properties

Approximately 30.8%, 51.6% and 59.8% of our total revenues (including amounts in discontinued operations) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were derived from the four Kindred Master Leases.

On June 7, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Provident Senior Living Trust (“Provident”) (see
“Note 5

—

Acquisitions”), which leased all of its properties to affiliates of Brookdale and Alterra. In September 2005, Brookdale was combined, through a series of mergers, with Alterra under a new holding company, Brookdale
Senior Living. Approximately 15.7%, 28.6% and 22.9% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were derived from our lease agreements with Brookdale Senior Living.

Each of our leases with Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living is a triple-net lease pursuant to which the tenant is required to pay all insurance, taxes,
utilities and maintenance and repairs related to the properties. In addition, the tenants are required to comply with the terms of the mortgage financing documents, if any, affecting the properties.

Each of Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living is subject to the reporting requirements of the Commission and is required to file with the Commission annual
reports containing audited financial information and quarterly reports containing unaudited financial information. The information related to Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living contained or referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is derived
from filings made by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living, as the case may be, with the Commission or other publicly available information, or has been provided to us by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living. We have not verified this information either
through an independent investigation or by reviewing Kindred’s or Brookdale Senior Living’s public filings. We have no reason to believe that this information is inaccurate in any material respect, but we cannot assure you that all of this
information is accurate. Kindred’s and Brookdale Senior Living’s filings with the Commission can be found at the Commission’s website at www.sec.gov. We are providing this data for informational purposes only, and you are encouraged
to obtain Kindred’s and Brookdale Senior Living’s publicly available filings from the Commission.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Kindred Master Leases

.    The properties leased to Kindred pursuant to the Kindred Master Leases are grouped into renewal
bundles, with each bundle containing a varying number of diversified properties. All properties within a bundle have primary terms ranging from ten to 15 years, commencing May 1, 1998, and, provided certain conditions are satisfied, are subject
to three five-year renewal terms.

Under each Kindred Master Lease, the aggregate annual rent is referred to as Base Rent (as defined in
the applicable Kindred Master Lease). Base Rent escalates on May 1 of each year at a specified rate over the Prior Period Base Rent (as defined in the applicable Kindred Master Lease) contingent upon the satisfaction of the specified facility
revenue parameters. On October 6, 2006, final appraisers designated by us and Kindred specified that the market annual rent escalator is 2.7% under Kindred Master Leases 1, 3 and 4, and is based on year-over-year changes in the Consumer Price
Index, with a floor of 2.25% and a ceiling of 4%, under Kindred Master Lease 2, in all cases contingent upon satisfaction of the aforementioned revenue parameters.

On April 27, 2007, Kindred renewed, through April 30, 2013, its leases covering all 64 healthcare assets owned by us (seven of which we subsequently sold on June 30, 2007 (see “Note

—

Dispositions”)) whose base term would have expired on April 30, 2008. Kindred retains two additional sequential five-year renewal options for these assets.

Brookdale Senior Living Leases

.    Our leases with Brookdale have primary terms of 15 years, commencing either
January 28, 2004 (in the case of 15 “Grand Court” properties we acquired in early 2004) or October 19, 2004 (in the case of the properties we acquired in connection with the Provident acquisition), and, provided certain
conditions are satisfied, are subject to two ten-year renewal terms. Our leases with Alterra also have primary terms of 15 years, commencing either October 20, 2004 or December 16, 2004 (both in the case of properties we acquired in
connection with the Provident acquisition), and, provided certain conditions are satisfied, are subject to two five-year renewal terms.

Under the terms of the Brookdale leases assumed in connection with the Provident acquisition, Brookdale is obligated to pay base rent, which escalates on January 1 of each year, by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) four times
the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index during the immediately preceding year or (ii) 3%. Under the terms of the Brookdale leases with respect to the “Grand Court” properties, Brookdale is obligated to pay base rent, which
escalates on February 1 of each year, by an amount equal to the greater of (i) 2% or (ii) 75% of the increase in the Consumer Price Index during the immediately preceding year. Under the terms of the Alterra leases, Alterra is
obligated to pay base rent, which escalates either on January 1 or November 1 of each year by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) four times the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index during the immediately preceding year or
(ii) 2.5%. We recognize rent revenue under the Brookdale and Alterra leases on a straight-line basis. See “Note 13

—

Commitments and Contingencies.”

The future contracted minimum rentals, excluding contingent rent escalations, but with straight-line rents where applicable, for all of our triple-net
leases are as follows:

Senior Living Operations

As a result of the acquisition of the Sunrise REIT properties, we are party to management agreements with Sunrise pursuant to which Sunrise currently
provides comprehensive accounting and property management services with respect to 79 of our seniors housing communities. Each management agreement has a term of 30 years from its effective date, the earliest of which began in 2004. Total revenues
attributable to senior living operations managed by Sunrise were $283.1 million for the period from April 26, 2007 through December 31, 2007, representing 36.2% of our total revenues (including amounts in discontinued operations) for the
year ended December 31, 2007.

Sunrise is subject to the reporting requirements of the Commission and is required to file with the
Commission annual reports containing audited financial information and quarterly reports containing unaudited financial information. According to public disclosures, Sunrise has not been timely filing such required reports and is currently
experiencing certain legal, accounting and regulatory difficulties. On July 25, 2007, Sunrise announced that its board of directors had decided to explore strategic alternatives intended to enhance shareholder value, including a possible sale
of Sunrise. We cannot predict what impact, if any, the outcomes of these uncertainties will have on Sunrise’s financial condition or ability to manage our senior living operations. You are encouraged to obtain additional information related to
Sunrise at the Commission’s website at www.sec.gov.

Note 4—Concentration of Credit Risk

As of December 31, 2007, approximately 39.7%, 22.0% and 14.9% of our properties, based on their original cost, were operated by Sunrise, Brookdale
Senior Living and Kindred, respectively, and approximately 76.9% and 13.9% of our properties, based on their original cost, were seniors housing communities and skilled nursing facilities, respectively. Our remaining properties consist of hospitals,
MOBs and other healthcare-related assets. These properties were located in 43 states, with properties in two states accounting for more than 10% of total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2007, and two Canadian provinces. Properties
in two states and one state accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Because we lease a substantial portion of our triple-net leased properties to Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living and they are each a significant source of our total revenues, their financial condition and ability and willingness to satisfy
their obligations under their respective leases and certain other agreements with us and their



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

willingness to renew those leases upon expiration of the initial base terms thereof will significantly impact our revenues and our ability to service our
indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. We cannot assure you that Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under its respective leases
and other agreements with us, and any inability or unwillingness on its part to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity, on our ability to service our indebtedness and on
our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT (a “Material Adverse Effect”). We also cannot assure you that Kindred and/or Brookdale Senior Living will elect to renew their
respective leases with us upon expiration of the initial base terms or any renewal terms thereof.

Although we have various rights as owner
under the Sunrise management agreements, we are relying on Sunrise’s personnel, good faith, expertise, historical performance, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information and judgment to manage our seniors housing
communities efficiently and effectively. We are also relying on Sunrise to set resident fees and otherwise operate those properties pursuant to our management agreements. A change in the senior management of Sunrise or any adverse developments in
Sunrise’s business and affairs or financial strength could also have a Material Adverse Effect on us. In addition, any inability or unwillingness on the part of Sunrise to satisfy its obligations under the management agreements it has with us
could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Note 5—Acquisitions

The following is a summary of our more significant acquisitions in 2007, 2006 and 2005. The primary reason for these acquisitions was to invest in seniors housing and healthcare-related properties with an expected
yield on investment, as well as to diversify our portfolio and revenue base and limit our dependence on any single operator, geography or asset type for our revenue.

Sunrise REIT Acquisition

On April 26, 2007, we completed the acquisition of all of the assets
of Sunrise REIT pursuant to the terms of a purchase agreement dated as of January 14, 2007, as amended, among us, our wholly owned subsidiaries, Ventas SSL Ontario I, Inc. (formerly 2124678 Ontario Inc., the “Securities Purchaser”)
and Ventas SSL Ontario II, Inc. (formerly 2124680 Ontario Inc., the “Asset Purchaser” and, together with the Securities Purchaser, the “Purchasers”), Sunrise REIT, Sunrise REIT Trust (“Sub Trust”) and Sunrise REIT GP
Inc. (“Sunrise GP”), in its capacity as general partner of Sunrise Canadian UPREIT, LP (“UPREIT”). The aggregate consideration for the Sunrise REIT acquisition, including the assumption of debt, was approximately $2.0 billion.

At the effective time of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, the Securities Purchaser purchased all of the interests and assumed all of the
liabilities of Sunrise REIT Canadian Holdings Inc. (“Canco”) and certain of Sunrise REIT’s intercompany notes held by Sub Trust, and the Asset Purchaser acquired all of Sunrise REIT’s remaining assets and liabilities from Sunrise
REIT, Sub Trust and UPREIT. Immediately following the Sunrise REIT acquisition, each unit of beneficial interest of Sunrise REIT outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (except for a small number of non-tendered units) was redeemed for
Cdn $16.50 in cash.

Through the Sunrise REIT acquisition, we acquired a 100% interest in 18 seniors housing communities and a 75% to 85%
interest in 59 additional seniors housing communities, with the minority interest in those 59 communities being owned by affiliates of Sunrise. Of the 77 communities, 66 are located in metropolitan areas of 19 U.S. states and eleven are located in
the Canadian provinces of Ontario and British Columbia.

As a result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, we are party to management agreements
with Sunrise pursuant to which Sunrise provides comprehensive accounting and property management services with respect to each of



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

the Sunrise REIT properties. Each management agreement has a term of 30 years from its effective date, the earliest of which began in 2004. Pursuant to the
management agreements, we pay Sunrise a base management fee of 6% of resident fees and similar revenues, subject to reduction based on below target performance for a pool of properties. The minimum management fee assessable under these agreements is
5% of resident fees and similar revenues of the properties. We also pay incentive fees if a pool of properties exceeds aggregate performance targets; provided, however, that total management fees, including incentive fees, shall not exceed 8% of
resident fees and similar revenues. The management agreements also specify that we (or the joint venture to which we are party, as applicable) will reimburse Sunrise for direct or indirect costs necessary to manage our seniors housing communities.

Under the terms of the letter agreement dated January 14, 2007 (the “ Letter Agreement”) between us and Sunrise, we
modified various management and other agreements and contractual relationships that existed between Sunrise, on the one hand, and Sunrise REIT, on the other hand (the “Existing Agreements”). Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Strategic
Alliance Agreement dated as of December 23, 2004 between Sunrise and Sunrise REIT was terminated effective upon the closing of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, except with respect to certain limited provisions. Under the terms of the Letter
Agreement, we have, among other things, a right of first offer to acquire seniors housing communities developed by Sunrise in Canada. In addition, we have a right of first offer to acquire seniors housing communities developed by Sunrise in the
United States within a demographically defined radius of any of the properties acquired by us in the Sunrise REIT acquisition. The terms of the rights of first offer for properties in both the United States and Canada are governed generally by the
terms set forth in the Strategic Alliance Agreement and the fixed price acquisition agreement referred to in the Strategic Alliance Agreement, but subject to modification of those terms to address changes in circumstances and other matters.

The Letter Agreement also (1) provides us assurances that Sunrise will cooperate with us in connection with our compliance with the
REIT rules under the Code, and in connection with our financial reporting obligations, (2) contains restrictions on our rights to transfer our interest in the acquired properties to transferees who compete with Sunrise or who do not meet
certain requirements, and (3) provides that Sunrise consents to the Sunrise REIT acquisition and waives certain rights under the Existing Agreements. Although not required, we and Sunrise may enter into various amendments to the Existing
Agreements to further address the matters set out in the Letter Agreement.

As a result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, we assumed all
rights and obligations of Sunrise REIT under two fixed price acquisition agreements with Sunrise. Under the terms of these fixed price acquisition agreements, funds were advanced prior to the Sunrise REIT acquisition to Sunrise in connection with
the development by Sunrise of seniors housing communities in Staten Island, New York and Vaughan, Ontario. The fixed price acquisition agreements granted to us an option to purchase a majority interest in each of these properties, independently, for
a fixed price and on fixed terms, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The funds advanced for a property under the fixed price acquisition agreements are advances on the fixed purchase price for the property and are applied to our
purchase price for our interest at the closing of the acquisition.

We funded the Sunrise REIT acquisition through $530.0 million of
borrowings under a senior interim loan, an equity-backed facility providing for the issuance of 700,000 shares of our Series A Senior Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, and the assumption of $861.1 million of
existing mortgage debt. In May 2007, we completed the sale of 26,910,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our shelf registration statement. We received $1.05 billion in net proceeds from the sale, which we
used along with the proceeds of the disposition of certain of our Kindred assets (see “Note 6

—

Dispositions”) and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility to redeem all of our Series A Senior Preferred Stock and
to repay our indebtedness under the senior interim loan.



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

For the year ended December 31, 2007, we expensed $5.2 million of preferred stock dividends and issuance costs related to the Series A Senior
Preferred Stock and $5.0 million of fees and interest associated with the senior interim loan (the latter of which is included in interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2007).

On June 19, 2007, we acquired an 80% interest in the seniors housing community located in Staten Island, New York in accordance with the terms of
the applicable fixed price acquisition agreement for approximately $25.5 million, inclusive of our share of assumed debt of $15.3 million.

On December 11, 2007, we acquired an 80% interest in the seniors housing community located in Vaughan, Ontario in accordance with the terms of the applicable fixed price acquisition agreement for approximately Cdn $43.6 million,
inclusive of our share of assumed construction debt of Cdn $23.3 million. The joint venture has the ability to borrow an additional Cdn $11.7 million under the existing construction loan for capital improvements.

We incurred $3.0 million of merger-related expenses (that were not capitalized) in connection with the Sunrise REIT acquisition during the year ended
December 31, 2007. Merger-related expenses include incremental costs directly related to the acquisition and expenses relating to our lawsuit against HCP, Inc (“HCP”).

Other 2007 Acquisitions

During 2007,
we acquired two seniors housing communities for an aggregate purchase price of $18.5 million, inclusive of assumed debt of $9.0 million at the time of the acquisition. The purchase price was allocated between land and buildings and improvements
of $0.7 million and $17.8 million, respectively, based upon their estimated fair values. These properties are being leased to affiliates of Senior Care, Inc. (“Senior Care”).

Also throughout 2007, we acquired eight MOBs, in seven separate transactions, for an aggregate purchase price of $150.5 million, inclusive of assumed
debt of $21.5 million at the time of the acquisitions. The purchase price was allocated between land and buildings and improvements of $7.6 million and $142.9 million, respectively, based upon their estimated fair values. Seven of these MOBs
are owned through joint ventures with three different partners that provide management and leasing services for the properties. The joint venture partners have a minority interest ranging from less than 1% to less than 9%.

Senior Care

In November 2006, we
completed the acquisition of 64 seniors housing and healthcare-related properties for an aggregate consideration of $602.4 million, consisting of approximately $422.6 million in cash, the assumption of $114.8 million of mortgage debt that was repaid
in January 2007 and 1,708,279 shares of our common stock. The portfolio consists of 40 assisted living communities, four multi-level retirement communities, 18 skilled nursing facilities and two rehabilitation hospitals in 15 states.

The properties are being leased to affiliates of Senior Care, pursuant to the terms of a triple-net master lease having an initial term of 15 years and
two five-year extensions. Approximately 6.1% and 1.6% of our total revenues (including amounts in discontinued operations) for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were derived from our lease agreements with Senior Care.



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Other 2006 Acquisitions

Also during
2006, we acquired eight seniors housing communities, in five separate transactions, for an aggregate purchase price of $74.3 million, including assumed debt of $10.8 million at the time of the acquisitions. The seniors housing communities are leased
to various operators under triple-net leases, each having initial terms ranging from ten to 15 years and initially providing aggregate, annual cash base rent of approximately $6.2 million, subject to escalation as provided in the leases.

Provident

On June 7, 2005,
we completed the acquisition of Provident in a transaction valued at approximately $1.2 billion. Provident was formed as a Maryland real estate investment trust in March 2004 and owned seniors housing properties located in the United States.
Pursuant to the Provident acquisition, we acquired 68 independent and assisted living communities in 19 states comprised of approximately 6,819 residential living units, all of which are leased to affiliates of Brookdale and Alterra pursuant to
triple-net leases with renewal options. Approximately 13.6%, 24.7% and 17.8% of our total revenues (including amounts in discontinued operations) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were derived from our lease
agreements related to the Provident properties.

We funded the cash portion of the purchase price for the Provident acquisition, which was
approximately $231.0 million, and repaid all outstanding borrowings under Provident’s credit facility at closing from a combination of net proceeds from the sale of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by Ventas
Realty and a wholly owned subsidiary, Ventas Capital Corporation (collectively, the “Issuers”), and borrowings under our previous secured revolving credit facility. Additionally, we issued approximately 15.0 million shares of our
common stock and share equivalents to Provident equity holders as part of the purchase price for the Provident acquisition. We also assumed approximately $459.4 million of property-level mortgage debt.

Other 2005 Acquisitions

Also during
2005, we acquired 23 seniors housing communities, an adjacent parcel of land and one hospital for an aggregate purchase price of $278.2 million, including assumed debt of $74.4 million at the time of the acquisitions. The seniors housing communities
and the hospital are leased to various operators under triple-net leases, each having initial terms ranging from ten to 15 years and initially providing aggregate, annual cash base rent of approximately $23.9 million, subject to escalation as
provided in the leases.

In addition, we acquired three MOBs in 2005 for an aggregate purchase price of $13.0 million, including assumed
debt of $7.3 million at the time of the acquisitions. These buildings are leased to various tenants under leases having various remaining terms and initially providing aggregate, annual cash base rent of approximately $1.7 million, subject to
escalation as provided in the leases. We have engaged third parties to manage the operations of the MOBs.

Note 6—Dispositions

On June 30, 2007, we completed the sale of 22 properties to Kindred for $171.5 million in net cash proceeds. Of these net proceeds, $14.1 million was held in escrow for use in a Code Section 1031 exchange,
of which all was utilized during the year ended December 31, 2007 for other acquisitions. See “Note 5—Acquisitions.” In addition, Kindred paid us a lease termination fee of $3.5 million. We recognized a net gain on the sale of
assets of $129.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. We did not make any dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2006. In 2005, we completed the sale of one seniors housing community for approximately $9.9 million in
net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of assets of approximately $5.1 million. In addition, the tenant paid us a lease termination fee of approximately $0.2 million. These net proceeds were held in escrow for use in a Code
Section 1031 exchange at December 31, 2005 and released back to us during 2006, as no like-kind exchange was consummated.

Note 7—Intangibles

At December 31, 2007, intangible lease assets, comprised of above market resident leases, in-place resident leases and other intangibles, were $7.3 million, $81.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2007, the accumulated amortization of the intangible assets was $58.4 million. The weighted average amortization period of intangible assets is approximately one year.

At December 31, 2007, intangible lease liabilities, comprised of below market resident leases, were $9.8 million. At December 31, 2007, the
accumulated amortization of the intangible liabilities was $6.6 million. The weighted average amortization period of intangible liabilities is approximately one year.

Note 8—Loans Receivable

As of December 31, 2007, we held three first mortgage loans in an
aggregate amount of $20.1 million. Our first mortgage loans have a 1% exit fee that was received at the date of issuance and is being deferred and amortized over the term of the loan. The aggregate unamortized balance of these deferred fees as of
December 31, 2007 was $0.1 million.

During 2005, we extended three first mortgage loans in the aggregate principal amount of $25.9
million. The loans accrue interest at a rate of 9% per annum and provide for monthly amortization of principal with balloon payment maturity dates in 2010. Each loan is guaranteed by an affiliate of the borrower and its two principals. Only two
of these loans were outstanding as of December 31, 2007.

Also during 2005, we invested in a portfolio of eight distressed mortgage
loans with eight separate borrowers for an aggregate purchase price of $21.4 million. As of December 31, 2005, our investment in the portfolio was satisfied by the buy-out of the applicable distressed mortgage loans in an amount equal to our
investment in these loans. In conjunction with these buy-outs, we extended three first mortgage loans in an aggregate principal amount of $10.5 million. These first mortgage loans also accrue interest at a rate of 9% per annum and provide for
monthly amortization of principal with balloon payment maturity dates in 2010. These three first mortgage loans are also guaranteed by a third party and its two principals. Only one of these loans was outstanding as of December 31, 2007.

Note 9—Borrowing Arrangements

The following is a summary of our long-term debt and certain
interest rate and maturity information as of December 31, 2007 and 2006:

Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility

In April 2006, we entered into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility which replaced our previous $300.0 million secured revolving credit
facility. Our unsecured revolving credit facility matures in 2009, with an option to extend for one year subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, and originally contained a $100.0 million “accordion feature” that permitted us to
increase our total borrowing capacity to $600.0 million. On March 30, 2007, we accessed the accordion feature and increased the borrowing capacity from $500.0 million to $600.0 million. On July 27, 2007, we amended our unsecured revolving
credit facility to include a $150.0 million accordion feature that permits us to expand our borrowing capacity to a total of $750.0 million upon satisfaction of certain conditions. Pricing under the unsecured revolving credit facility remained the
same and we did not record any material expenses or charges in connection with the amendment.

Generally, borrowings outstanding under the
unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating LIBOR-based rate per annum plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage. As of December 31, 2007, the applicable percentage was 0.75%. Our previous secured
revolving credit facility also bore interest at a fluctuating LIBOR-based rate per annum plus an applicable percentage. The applicable percentage for the previous secured revolving credit facility was 1.45% from January 1, 2006 until its
replacement in April 2006.

We incurred losses on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2006 and $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, representing the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the previous secured revolving credit facility and our commercial mortgage backed securities
(“CMBS”) loan, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Canadian Credit Facility

On
August 24, 2007, we entered into a Cdn $90.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Canadian credit facility”). Generally, borrowings outstanding under the Canadian credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating
“Bankers’ Acceptance” rate per annum plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage. As of December 31, 2007, the applicable percentage was 0.75%.

On January 24, 2008, we amended the Canadian credit facility to expand our borrowing capacity to a total of Cdn $105.0 million. We also extended the
original maturity date from February 24, 2008 to May 24, 2008. We may further extend the maturity date for an additional three months subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.

Convertible Senior Notes

In December 2006, we completed the offering of $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of our


/


% Convertible
Senior Notes due 2011 (the “Convertible Notes”). The Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holder (i) prior to September 15, 2011, upon the occurrence of specified events and (ii) on or after
September 11, 2011, at any time prior to the close of business on the second business day prior to the stated maturity, in each case into cash up to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes and cash or shares of our common stock, at our
election, in respect of any conversion value in excess of the principal amount at an initial conversion rate of 22.1867 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which equates to an initial conversion price of approximately $45.07 per share). The
conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including the payment of a quarterly dividend in excess of $0.395 per share. As of December 31, 2007, the adjusted conversion rate was 22.3615 shares per $1,000 principal amount
of notes (which equates to a conversion price of approximately $44.72 per share). To the extent the market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price, our earnings per share will be diluted. There was no dilutive impact per share for the
year ended December 31, 2007.

The Convertible Notes are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior
unsecured basis by Ventas Realty and by certain of our other direct and indirect subsidiaries as described in the indenture. The Convertible Notes are part of our and the guarantors’ general unsecured obligations, ranking equal in right of
payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior obligations and ranking senior to all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future subordinated indebtedness. However, the Convertible Notes are effectively
subordinated to our and the guarantors’ secured indebtedness, if any, to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness. The Convertible Notes are also structurally subordinated to preferred equity and indebtedness, whether
secured or unsecured, of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Convertible Notes.

We may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to
maturity except to the extent necessary to preserve our status as a REIT.

If we experience certain kinds of changes of control, holders
may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes for cash at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.

principal amount of 2014 Senior Notes originally issued in October 2004. The additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Senior Notes was issued at a 1% discount to par value. The additional $50.0 million aggregate principal
amount and the original $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Senior Notes are governed by the same indenture.

In April 2002, we completed the offering of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8

The 2017 Senior Notes, 2016 Senior Notes, 2010 Senior Notes, 2015 Senior Notes, 2014 Senior Notes, 2009 Senior Notes, and 2012
Senior Notes (collectively, the “Senior Notes”) are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by us and by certain of our current and future subsidiaries as described in their respective indentures

If we experience certain kinds of changes of control,
the Issuers must make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase; provided,
however, that in the event Moody’s and S&P have confirmed their ratings at Ba3 or higher and BB- or higher on the Senior Notes and certain other conditions are met, this repurchase obligation will not apply.

Mortgages

At December 31, 2007,
we had outstanding 121 mortgage loans totaling $1.57 billion that are collateralized by the underlying assets of the properties. Outstanding principal balances on these loans ranged from $0.4 million to $59.4 million as of December 31, 2007.
The loans generally bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 5.4% to 8.5% per annum, except for 15 loans with outstanding principal balances ranging from $0.4 million to $32.0 million, which bear interest at the lender’s variable rates
ranging from 3.4% to 7.3% per annum as of December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, the weighted average annual rate on fixed rate debt was 6.5% and the weighted average annual rate on the variable rate debt was 6.1%. The loans had a
weighted average maturity of 7.0 years as of December 31, 2007. Sunrise’s portion of total debt was $157.1 million as of December 31, 2007.

Scheduled Maturities of Borrowing Arrangements and Other Provisions

As of December 31, 2007,
our indebtedness had the following maturities (in thousands):



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Certain provisions of our long-term debt contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:
(i) incur debt; (ii) make certain dividends, distributions and investments; (iii) enter into certain transactions; (iv) merge, consolidate or transfer certain assets; and (v) sell assets. We and certain of our subsidiaries
are also required to maintain total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of this group’s unsecured debt.

Derivatives and Hedging

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to the effect of interest rate movements on future cash flows under our variable rate
debt agreements and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative instruments.

For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used primarily to fix the rate on debt based on floating-rate indices and to manage the cost of borrowing
obligations. We currently have an interest rate swap to manage interest rate risk (the “Swap”). We prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, we have a policy of only entering into contracts
with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivative is designed to hedge, we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on
our net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.

In 2001, we entered into the Swap in the original notional
amount of $450.0 million to hedge floating-rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008, under which we pay a fixed rate of 5.385% and receive LIBOR from the counterparty to the agreement. The Swap is treated as a cash
flow hedge. In 2003 and 2005, due to our lower expected future variable rate debt balances, we reduced the notional amount of the Swap to $330.0 million and then to $100.0 million for its remaining term in exchange for payments from us of
approximately $8.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The $2.3 million partial swap breakage cost and $3.3 million of the deferred gain were recognized as a net gain of $1.0 million in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended
December 31, 2005.

Amortization of the deferred gain from the termination of a swap arrangement was included in accumulated other
comprehensive income in the amount of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2007, this amount was fully amortized.

Unrealized gains and losses on the Swap are recorded as other comprehensive income. The amounts reclassified into interest expense due to the Swap for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $0.5
million, $0.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively. No amount was reflected as interest expense due to ineffectiveness of the Swap for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, as our variable rate debt balances approximated the
$100.0 million notional amount of the Swap.

There are no collateral requirements under the Swap. Although we are exposed to credit loss in
the event of the non-performance by the counterparty to the Swap, we do not anticipate any such non-performance. The notional amount of the Swap at December 31, 2007 was $100.0 million, which is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2008.

At December 31, 2007, the Swap was reported at its fair value of $0.5 million and is included in other accrued liabilities in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The offsetting entry is reported as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss.

In January 2007, we entered into two Canadian call options in conjunction with our agreement to acquire the assets of Sunrise REIT. See “Note

Acquisitions.” We paid an aggregate purchase price of $8.5 million for these contracts, which had an aggregate notional call amount of Cdn $750.0 million at a Cdn $1.18 strike price. These contracts were settled on April 26,
2007, the acquisition date, and we received cash of $33.2 million upon settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized gains related to call option contracts of $24.3 million, which is included as a foreign currency gain on our
Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Unamortized Fair Value Adjustment

The fair value adjustment related to the long-term debt we assumed in connection with the Sunrise REIT acquisition was $22.2 million and is recognized as
effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instruments. The estimated aggregate amortization of the fair value adjustment related to long-term debt for each of the five succeeding years follows: 2008—$4.3 million; 2009—$3.3
million; 2010—$2.9 million; 2011—$2.9 million; and 2012—$2.4 million.

Note 10—Fair Values of Financial Instruments

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying amounts and fair values of our financial instruments were as follows:

Fair value estimates are subjective in nature and depend on a number of important assumptions,
including estimates of future cash flows, risks, discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument. The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on
the reported estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market exchange.

Note 11—Stock-Based Compensation

Compensation Plans

We have six plans under which options to purchase common stock and/or shares or units of restricted stock have been, or may be, granted to officers,
employees and non-employee directors, one plan under which executive officers may receive common stock in lieu of compensation and two plans under which certain directors have received or may receive common stock in lieu of director fees (the
following are collectively referred to as the “Plans”): (1) the 1987 Incentive Compensation Program (Employee Plan); (2) the 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan); (3) the 2004 Stock Plan for Directors;
(4) the TheraTx, Incorporated 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan; (5) the Common Stock Purchase Plan for Directors (the “Directors Stock Purchase Plan”); (6) the Executive Deferred Stock Compensation Plan; (7) the
Nonemployee Director Deferred Stock Compensation Plan; (8) the 2006 Incentive Plan; and (9) the 2006 Stock Plan for Directors.



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

During the year ended December 31, 2007, option and restricted stock grants and stock issuances could only be made under the Executive Deferred Stock
Compensation Plan, the Directors Stock Purchase Plan, the Nonemployee Director Deferred Stock Compensation Plan, the 2006 Incentive Plan and the 2006 Stock Plan for Directors. The 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan) and the 2004 Stock
Plan for Directors expired on December 31, 2006, and no additional grants were permitted under those plans after that date. Additional grants are also not permitted under the 1987 Incentive Compensation Program (Employee Plan) or the TheraTx,
Incorporated 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan. In addition, the Directors Stock Purchase Plan terminated in accordance with its terms during 2007.

The number of shares reserved and the number of shares available for future grants or issuance under these plans as of December 31, 2007 are as follows:

•

Executive Deferred Stock Compensation Plan—500,000 shares are reserved for issuance to our executive officers in lieu of the payment of all or a portion of
their salary, at their option, and, as of December 31, 2007, 500,000 shares were available for future issuance.

•

Nonemployee Director Deferred Stock Compensation Plan—500,000 shares are reserved for issuance to nonemployee directors in lieu of the payment of all or a
portion of their retainer and meeting fees, at their option, and, as of December 31, 2007, 473,730 shares were available for future issuance.

•

2006 Incentive Plan—5,000,000 shares are reserved for grants or issuance to employees and 4,663,364 were available for future grants or issuance as of
December 31, 2007. This plan replaced the 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan).

•

2006 Stock Plan for Directors—400,000 shares are reserved for grants or issuance to non-employee directors and 364,370 were available for future grants or
issuance as of December 31, 2007. This plan replaced the 2004 Stock Plan for Directors.

Under the Plans (other than
the Executive Deferred Stock Compensation Plan, the Directors Stock Purchase Plan and the Nonemployee Director Deferred Stock Compensation Plan), options are exercisable at the market price on the date of grant, expire ten years from the date of
grant, and vest over varying periods ranging from one to four years. Vesting of certain options may accelerate upon a change of control of Ventas, as defined in the applicable Plan, and other events.

We have also granted options and restricted stock to certain officers, employees and non-employee directors outside of the Plans. These options and
shares of restricted stock vest over varying periods, and the options are exercisable at the market price on the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2007, options for 38,000 shares had been granted
outside of the Plans to certain employees and non-employee directors and remained outstanding.

Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted
for the Plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, as permitted by SFAS No. 123. Consequently, no stock-based compensation cost relating to stock options was recognized in our Consolidated Statement of
Income for any period prior to 2006, as all options granted under the Plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value provisions for
share-based awards pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R), using the modified-prospective transition method. Under that transition method, compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes: (i) compensation cost for all share-based awards granted prior
to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the attribution method and grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (ii) compensation cost for all share-based awards
granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value as estimated in accordance with the



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), all recognized on a straight-line basis as the requisite service periods are rendered. Results for prior periods have not
been restated. Compensation costs related to stock options for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $1.9 million and $0.9 million, respectively.

The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 caused our net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 to be approximately $931,000 lower than if we had continued to account for stock-based
compensation under APB Opinion No. 25. The adoption caused basic and diluted earnings per share to be $0.01 lower for the year ended December 31, 2006.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2005, as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) to all
stock-based compensation granted under equity award plans for awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Stock Options

In determining the estimated fair value of our stock options as of the date of grant, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

2005 were $9.8 million, $6.6 million and $6.8 million, respectively.

administrative expenses of approximately $5.6 million in 2007, $2.1 million in 2006 and $2.0 million in 2005. Restricted stock generally vests over three- to
five-year periods. The vesting of certain restricted shares may accelerate upon a change of control of Ventas, as defined in the applicable Plan, and other events. As required upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the contra equity balance in
unearned compensation on restricted stock of approximately $713,000 as of January 1, 2006 was reclassified (i.e. netted against capital in excess of par value) in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006.

A summary of the status of our nonvested restricted stock units and restricted stock as of December 31, 2007, and changes during the year ended
December 31, 2007 follows:

As of December 31, 2007, there was $11,453,000 unrecognized compensation cost related to
nonvested restricted stock under the Plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average of 2.0 years.

Employee and
Director Stock Purchase Plan

During 2005, we implemented the Ventas Employee and Director Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) under
which our employees and directors may purchase shares of our common stock at a discount. Pursuant to the terms of the ESPP, on each purchase date, participants may purchase shares of common stock at a price not less than 90% of the market price on
that date, with respect to the employee tax-favored portion of the plan, and not less than 95% of the market price on that date, with respect to the additional employee and director portion of the plan. We have reserved 2,500,000 shares for issuance
under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2007, 18,762 shares had been purchased under the ESPP and 2,481,238 shares were available for future issuance.

Employee Benefit Plan

We maintain a 401(K) plan that allows for eligible employees to defer
compensation subject to certain limitations imposed by the Code. We make a contribution for each qualifying employee of up to 3% of his or her salary, subject to limitations, regardless of the employee’s individual contribution. During 2007,
2006 and 2005, our contributions were approximately $106,000, $85,600 and $78,000, respectively.

Note 12—Income Taxes

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing with the year ended December 31, 1999. We also have subsidiaries which we have
elected to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS” or “TRS entities”), which are subject to federal and state income taxes. The TRS entities were created or acquired in connection with the Sunrise REIT acquisition. All
other entities are collectively referred to as “the REIT” within this Note 12.



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

We intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to enable us to qualify as a REIT. Our actual qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our
ability to meet, on a continuing basis, distribution levels, stock ownership, and the various qualification tests. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, our tax treatment of distributions per common share was as follows:

No net provision for income taxes was recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the
years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 due to our belief that we qualified as a REIT and the distribution of more than 100% of our 2006 and 2005 taxable income as a dividend. We believe we have met the annual distribution requirement by payment
of at least 90% of our estimated taxable income for 2007, 2006 and 2005. As a result of the TRS entities created and acquired in 2007, the consolidated provision (benefit) for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007 is as follows (in
thousands):


Current

Deferred

(28,950

)

Total

(28,042

)

The deferred benefit for the year ended December 31, 2007 is reduced by income tax expense of
$1.1 million related to the minority interest share of net income. Although a substantial portion of the deferred tax benefit is due to the reversal of the deferred tax liability established as a result of the step-up in basis pursuant to purchase
accounting, the deferred tax benefit is dependent in part upon generating sufficient taxable income in future periods.

Although the TRS
entities did not pay any federal income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007, federal income tax payments for these TRS entities may increase in future years as we exhaust net operating loss carryforwards and as additional seniors housing
communities are developed and occupied. Such increases could be significant.

Income tax expense computed by applying the federal corporate
tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 is reconciled to the income tax benefit as follows (in thousands):

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The REIT made no income tax payments for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Tax payments of $2.1 million related to built-in gains income
tax were made for the year ended December 31, 2007.

As part of the acquisition of Sunrise REIT, we established a beginning net
deferred tax liability of $306.3 million related to temporary differences (primarily property and related assets net of net operating loss carryforwards).

Each TRS is a tax paying component for purposes of classifying deferred tax assets and liabilities. The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards included in the net deferred tax liabilities at
December 31, 2007 and 2006 are summarized as follows (in thousands):

Due to the uncertainty of the realization of certain tax assets, we established valuation
allowances. The majority of the valuation allowances related to the outside tax basis of partnership interests where there was uncertainty regarding their realization.

The net difference between tax bases and the reported amount of REIT assets and liabilities for federal income tax purposes was approximately $485.1 million and $446.4 million less than the book bases of those assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

We potentially remain
subject to corporate level taxes for any asset dispositions during the ten-year period immediately after the assets were owned by a C corporation (either prior to our REIT election, through stock acquisition or merger) (“built-in gains
tax”). The amount of income potentially subject to this special corporate level tax is generally equal to the lesser of (i) the excess of the fair value of the asset over its adjusted tax basis as of the date it became a REIT asset or
(ii) the actual amount of gain. Some but not all future gains could be offset by available net operating losses (“NOLs”). We had a $23.3 million and a $30.4 million deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, to be utilized for any built-in gain tax related to the disposition of assets owned prior to our REIT election in 1999. The ten-year period in which these assets are subject to built-in gains tax will end on December 31, 2008.
Accordingly, any remaining deferred tax liability related to the built-in gains tax will be reversed at December 31, 2008.

Generally,
we are subject to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the year ended December 31, 2004 and subsequent years and are subject to audit by state taxing authorities for the year ended
December 31, 2003 and subsequent years. In Canada, the 2004 through 2007 tax years generally remain subject to examination for certain entities we acquired as part of the Sunrise REIT acquisition.

During 2006, we were notified by the IRS that it had completed its audit of our 2001 federal tax return with no additional tax being due. Accordingly, we
reversed into income a previously recorded $1.8 million tax liability related to uncertainties surrounding the outcome of this audit.



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

We have a combined NOL carryforward of $66.5 million at December 31, 2007 related to the TRS entities and an NOL carryforward reported by the REIT of
$88.6 million. These amounts can be used to offset future taxable income (and/or taxable income for prior years if audits of any prior year’s return determine that amounts are owed), if any. The REIT will be entitled to utilize NOLs and tax
credit carryforwards only to the extent that REIT taxable income exceeds our deduction for dividends paid. The NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2024 with respect to the TRS entities and in 2018 for the REIT.

As a result of the uncertainties relating to the ultimate utilization of existing REIT NOLs, no net deferred tax benefit has been ascribed to REIT NOL
carryforwards as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. The IRS may challenge our entitlement to these tax attributes during its review of the tax returns for the previous tax years. We believe we are entitled to these tax attributes, but we cannot
assure you as to the outcome of these matters.

On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48. As a result of applying the provisions of FIN
48, we recognized no change in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and no adjustment in accumulated earnings as of January 1, 2007. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax
expense.

The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):

Included in the unrecognized tax benefits of $9.4 million at December 31, 2007 was $9.4
million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce our annual effective tax rate. We accrued no potential penalties and interest related to the unrecognized tax benefits during 2007, and in total, as of December 31, 2007, we have
recorded no liability for potential penalties and interest. We expect our unrecognized tax benefits to increase by $2.7 million during 2008.

Note
13—Commitments and Contingencies

Assumption of Certain Operating Liabilities and Litigation

As a result of the structure of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, we may be subject to various liabilities of Sunrise REIT arising out of the ownership or
operation of the Sunrise REIT properties prior to the acquisition. If the liabilities we have assumed are greater than expected, or if there are obligations relating to the Sunrise REIT properties of which we were not aware at the time of completion
of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, such liabilities and/or obligations could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

In connection with our
spin off of Kindred in 1998, Kindred agreed, among other things, to assume all liabilities and to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against certain losses, claims and litigation arising out of the ownership or operation of the
healthcare operations or any of the assets transferred to Kindred in the spin off, including without limitation all claims arising out of the third-party leases and third-party guarantees assigned to and assumed by Kindred at the time of the spin
off. Under Kindred’s plan of reorganization, Kindred assumed and agreed to fulfill these obligations. The total aggregate remaining minimum rental payments under the third-party leases was approximately $16.0 million as of December 31,
2007, and we believe that we had no material exposure under the third-party guarantees.

Similarly, in connection with Provident’s
acquisition of certain Brookdale-related and Alterra-related entities in 2005 and our subsequent acquisition of Provident, Brookdale and Alterra agreed, among other things,



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

to indemnify and hold Provident (and, as a result of the Provident acquisition, us) harmless from and against certain liabilities arising out of the
ownership or operation of such entities prior to their acquisition by Provident.

We cannot give any assurances that Kindred or such
Brookdale Senior Living subsidiaries will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy, or that they will be willing to satisfy, their respective obligations under these arrangements. If Kindred or such Brookdale
Senior Living subsidiaries do not satisfy or otherwise honor their respective obligations to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless under their respective contractual arrangements with us, then we may be liable for the payment and performance of
such obligations and may have to assume the defense of such claims or litigation, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Brookdale Leases

Subject to certain limitations and restrictions, if during the first six years of the initial term of our
Brookdale leases assumed in connection with the Provident acquisition we, either voluntarily or at Brookdale’s request, obtain new mortgage debt or refinance existing mortgage debt on property covered by a Brookdale lease, then we may be
required to pay Brookdale the net proceeds from any such mortgage debt financing or refinancing. Also, subject to certain limitations and conditions, Brookdale may request that we obtain new mortgage debt or refinance existing mortgage debt on the
property covered by the Brookdale leases, and we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any such financing or refinancing from the holder of the then existing mortgage debt on the applicable Brookdale property. In connection
with any such financing or refinancing, the rent for the applicable Brookdale property will be increased using a recomputed lease basis increased by an amount equal to the net financed proceeds paid to Brookdale plus (with limited exceptions) any
fees, penalties, premiums or other costs related to such financing or refinancing. If the monthly debt service on any financed or refinanced proceeds paid to Brookdale exceeds the rent increase attributable to those financed or refinanced proceeds,
then Brookdale is required to pay the excess. In addition, under certain circumstances, Brookdale will also be required to pay additional amounts relating to increases in debt service and other costs relating to any such financing or refinancing.

Brookdale’s, Alterra’s, Sunrise’s or such other tenants’, operators’ and managers’ liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, which in turn could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Litigation Related to the Sunrise REIT Acquisition

On February 14, 2007, HCP submitted the first of a series of conditional proposals to acquire the assets of Sunrise REIT at a price per unit of Cdn $18.00 in cash, conditioned upon HCP entering into an agreement
with Sunrise to modify certain of the contracts between Sunrise and Sunrise REIT. In connection with those proposals from HCP, we, as well as Sunrise REIT, Sunrise and HCP, sought legal interpretations in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice
concerning various agreements pertaining to the acquisition of Sunrise REIT.

On February 21, 2007, we filed an application in the
Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List), Court File No. 07-CL-6893, seeking, among other things, a declaration from the Court that Sunrise REIT was obligated, pursuant to its purchase agreement dated as of January 14, 2007 (the
“Purchase Agreement”) with us, to enforce the standstill terms of the agreement dated November 8, 2006 between Sunrise REIT and HCP (the “Standstill Agreement”). On March 6, 2007, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice
released a ruling, declaring that Sunrise REIT was obligated to comply with its covenants in the Purchase Agreement to enforce the Standstill Agreement with HCP. The Court also declared that the Standstill Agreement was still in effect, confirming
HCP’s several conditional proposals to purchase Sunrise REIT were not bona fide and were made in breach of its Standstill Agreement. The Court dismissed the applications filed by Sunrise REIT and Sunrise, which sought clarification regarding
their rights to negotiate with HCP regarding its proposals. On March 23, 2007, the Court of Appeal for Ontario upheld the decision of the Superior Court.

On April 5, 2007, we commenced an action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Court File No. 07-CV-330703PD1, to recover from Sunrise REIT damages resulting from, among other things, Sunrise REIT’s
breaches of its standstill enforcement obligations in the Purchase Agreement. On April 26, 2007, upon closing of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, we and Sunrise REIT entered into an agreement to, among other things, settle this outstanding
litigation against Sunrise REIT.

On May 3, 2007, we filed a lawsuit against HCP in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Kentucky, entitled

Ventas, Inc. v. HCP, Inc.

, Case No. 07-cv-238-JGH. We assert claims of tortious interference with contract and tortious interference with prospective business advantage. The complaint alleges that HCP
interfered with our Purchase Agreement to acquire the assets and liabilities of Sunrise REIT and with the process for unitholder consideration of the Purchase Agreement. The complaint alleges, among other things, that HCP made certain improper and
misleading offers to acquire Sunrise REIT and that HCP’s actions caused us to suffer substantial damages, including, among other things, the payment of materially greater consideration to acquire Sunrise REIT resulting from the substantial
increase in the purchase price that was agreed to in the original Purchase Agreement and the delay in closing the acquisition, as well as the negative movements in the foreign currency exchange rates and the per share price of our common equity
during such delay. We are seeking monetary relief and punitive damages against HCP. On July 2, 2007, HCP filed its response to our complaint, along with a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. On August 6, 2007, we filed our response to
HCP’s motion to dismiss. On December 19, 2007, the District Court denied HCP’s motion to dismiss. Although we intend to pursue the claims in the action vigorously, we cannot assure you that we will prevail on any of the claims in the
action, or, if we do prevail on one or more of the claims, of the amount of recovery that may be awarded to us for such claims.

Other
Litigation

We are a plaintiff in an action seeking a declaratory judgment and damages entitled

Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership et
al. v. Black Diamond CLO 1998-1 Ltd., et al.

, Case No. 99 C107076, filed November 22, 1999 in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Kentucky. Two of the three defendants in that action, Black Diamond International Funding, Ltd.
and BDC Finance, LLC (collectively “Black Diamond”), have asserted counterclaims



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

against us under theories of breach of contract, tortious interference with contract and abuse of process. We dispute the material allegations contained in
Black Diamond’s counterclaims and we intend to continue to pursue our claims and defend the counterclaims vigorously. We are unable at this time to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for the counterclaims in this action, and therefore,
no provision for liability, if any, resulting from this litigation has been made in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2007.

We are party to various other lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which may not be insured) arising in the normal course of our business, including, without limitation, in connection with the operations of
our seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise. It is the opinion of management that, except as set forth in this Note 15, the disposition of these actions, investigations and claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on us. However, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, investigations and claims, and if management’s assessment of our liability with respect to these actions, investigations and claims is
incorrect, such actions, investigations and claims could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Note 16—Capital Stock

At December 31, 2007, our authorized capital stock consisted of 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.25 per share, and 10,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share. Our authorized capital stock at December 31, 2006 and 2005 consisted of 180,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock.

In May 2007, we completed the sale of 26,910,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our current shelf registration
statement. We received $1.05 billion in net proceeds from the sale, which we used along with the proceeds of the disposition of the Kindred assets (see “Note 6

—

Dispositions”) and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit
facility to redeem all of our outstanding Series A Senior Preferred Stock and to repay our indebtedness under the senior interim loan used to fund a portion of the Sunrise REIT acquisition.

Our automatic universal shelf registration statement, filed with the Commission in April 2006, relates to the sale, from time to time, of an
indeterminate amount of debt securities and related guarantees, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. The registration statement replaced our previous universal shelf registration statement, under which approximately $500.0
million of securities remained available for offering.

In July 2005, we completed the sale of 3,247,000 shares of our common stock in an
underwritten public offering pursuant to our previous shelf registration statement. We received $97.0 million in net proceeds from the sale, which we used to repay indebtedness under our previous secured revolving credit facility and for general
corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions.

In February 2008, we completed the sale of 4,485,000 shares of our common stock
in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our current shelf registration statement. We received $191.9 million in net proceeds, before expenses but after the underwriting discount, from the sale, which we used in part to repay indebtedness
and will use for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to fund future acquisitions, if any.

Excess Share
Provision

In order to preserve our ability to maintain REIT status, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that if a person acquires
beneficial ownership of greater than 9% of our outstanding common stock or 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of such limit are deemed to be



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

excess shares. These shares are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization
selected by our Board of Directors. The trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the shares.

We have the right to buy the excess shares for a purchase price equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares, or (ii) the market price on the date we buy
the shares, and we may defer payment of the purchase price for the excess shares for up to five years. If we do not purchase the excess shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the excess shares at the direction of the Board of
Directors. The owner of the excess shares is entitled to receive the lesser of the proceeds from the sale of the excess shares or the original purchase price for such excess shares; any additional amounts are payable to the beneficiary of the trust.

The Board of Directors is empowered to grant waivers from the excess share provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation.

Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

We have a Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. Under the plan’s terms, existing stockholders may purchase shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of the cash distribution on their
shares of our common stock. In addition, existing stockholders, as well as new investors, may purchase shares of common stock by making optional cash payments. In March 2005, we began offering a 1% discount on the purchase price of our stock to
shareholders who reinvest their dividends and/or make optional cash purchases of common stock through the plan. The availability of a market discount is at our discretion. The granting of a discount for one month or quarter, as applicable, will not
insure the availability of a discount or the same discount in future months or quarters, respectively. Each month or quarter, as applicable, we may lower or eliminate the discount without prior notice. We may also, without prior notice, change our
determination as to whether common shares will be purchased by the plan administrator directly from us or in the open market.

Note 17—Related
Party Transactions

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had loan receivables of approximately $2.1 million and $2.5 million,
respectively, due from certain current and former executive officers. The loans include interest provisions (with a 4.9% average annual interest rate) and were made in 1998 and at various times from 1999 through 2002 to finance the income taxes
payable by the executive officers resulting from: (i) our 1998 spin off of Kindred and (ii) vesting of restricted shares. The loans are payable over a period of ten years. Interest on a note relating to the spin off in the principal amount
of $0.4 million at December 31, 2007 (the “Spin Off Note”) is paid on a quarterly basis and principal on this note is paid annually. The payee of the Spin Off Note resigned as an employee and director of Ventas in January 2003.
In the event of a change in control, as defined in our previous 1997 Incentive Compensation Plan, accrued interest on and the principal balance of the Spin Off Note is forgiven. Interest on the note relating to taxes paid for the vested portion of
restricted shares (the “Restricted Share Note”) is payable annually out of and only to the extent of dividends from the vested restricted shares. In the event of a change in control or upon termination of the officer without cause, as such
terms are defined in the relevant employment agreement, the principal balance of the Restricted Share Note is forgiven. The Restricted Share Note is secured by a pledge of all of the restricted shares to which the Restricted Share Note relates and
the Restricted Share Note is otherwise non-recourse. The Spin Off Note is not secured.

During 1998, we acquired eight personal care
facilities and related facilities for approximately $7.1 million from Tangram Rehabilitation Network, Inc. (“Tangram”). Tangram is a wholly owned subsidiary of Res-Care,



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Inc. (“Res-Care”) of which a member of our Board of Directors is the Chairman of the Board. We lease the Tangram facilities to Tangram pursuant to
a master lease agreement which is guaranteed by Res-Care. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, Tangram has paid us approximately $917,000, $897,000 and $863,000, respectively, in base rent payments.

Note 19—Segment Information

As of December 31, 2007, we operated through two reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties and senior living
operations. Our triple-net leased properties segment consists of financing, owning and leasing seniors housing and healthcare-related properties in the United States and leasing or subleasing those properties to healthcare operating companies under
“triple-net” or “absolute-net” leases, which require the tenants to pay all property-related expenses. Our senior living operations segment consists of investments in seniors housing communities located in the United States and
Canada for which we engage Sunrise to manage the operations.

We acquired the senior living operations segment on April 26, 2007,
pursuant to the purchase of the Sunrise REIT properties. With the addition of these properties, we believed segment differentiation would be appropriate based on the different economic and legal structures used to acquire and own those assets. Prior
to the acquisition, we operated through one reportable segment – investment in real estate – which included the triple-net leased properties and our MOBs. Our MOB segment consists of leasing space primarily to physicians and other
healthcare-related businesses and engaging third parties to manage those operations. Due to our limited operation of and allocation of capital to the MOBs, we separated them from the triple-net leased properties segment. However, the MOB segment is
not individually reported and is included in “All Other” because it does not meet the quantitative thresholds of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information” at the current time.

We evaluate performance of the combined properties in each segment based on net operating income before interest (excluding interest
income from loans receivable), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, rent reset costs, reversal of contingent liability, foreign currency gains/losses, general, administrative and professional fees, merger-related expenses and minority
interest. There are no intersegment sales or transfers.



VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

All other revenues consist primarily of rental income related to the MOBs, interest income from loans receivable and other miscellaneous income. All other
assets consist primarily of MOB assets and corporate assets including cash, restricted cash, deferred financing costs, notes receivable, and miscellaneous accounts receivable.

Note 21—ETOP Condensed Consolidating Information

ETOP, of which we own substantially all of the
partnership interests, and the ETOP Subsidiary Guarantors have provided full and unconditional guarantees, on a joint and several basis with us and certain of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, of the obligation to pay principal and
interest with respect to the Senior Notes and the Convertible Notes. See “Note 19—Condensed Consolidating Information.” Certain of ETOP’s other direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (the “ETOP Non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries”) have not provided a guarantee of the Senior Notes or the Convertible Notes and, therefore, are not directly obligated with respect to the Senior Notes or the Convertible Notes.

Contractual and legal restrictions, including those contained in the instruments governing certain of the ETOP Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries’
outstanding indebtedness, may under certain circumstances restrict ETOP’s (and therefore our) ability to obtain cash from the ETOP Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries for the purpose of satisfying ETOP’s and our debt service obligations, including
ETOP’s and our guarantee of payment of principal and interest on the Senior Notes and our primary obligation to pay principal and interest on the Convertible Notes. See “Note 9—Borrowing Arrangements.” Certain of the ETOP
Subsidiary Guarantors’ properties are subject to mortgages.
