resulting from increased operating costs and uninsured liabilities for professional liability claims, particularly in the state of Florida, and the ability of Kindred and the Company’s other operators to accurately estimate the magnitude of
such liabilities and (s) the value of the Company’s common stock in Kindred and the limitations on the ability of



the Company to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of its common stock in Kindred arising out of the securities laws and the registration
rights agreement the Company entered into with Kindred and certain of the holders of common stock in Kindred. Many of such factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.

PART I

ITEM 1.     BUSINESS

BUSINESS

Overview

Ventas, Inc. (“Ventas” or the
“Company”) is a healthcare real estate investment trust (“REIT”) with a geographically diverse portfolio of healthcare-related facilities. As of December 31, 2002, this portfolio consisted of 44 hospitals, 220 nursing facilities
and nine other healthcare and senior housing facilities in 37 states. The Company leases these facilities to healthcare operating companies under “triple-net” or “absolute-net” leases. As of December 31, 2002, Kindred Healthcare,
Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Kindred”) lease 210 of the Company’s nursing facilities and all but one of the Company’s hospitals. The Company also has investments relating to 25 healthcare and senior housing
facilities located in Ohio and Maryland. The Company operates in one segment which consists of financing, owning and leasing healthcare-related and senior housing facilities. See the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, including
“Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Company’s business strategy is comprised of two primary objectives: diversifying its portfolio of properties and increasing its
earnings. The Company intends to diversify its portfolio by operator, facility type and reimbursement source. The Company intends to invest in or acquire additional healthcare-related and/or senior housing properties, which could include hospitals,
nursing centers, assisted or independent living facilities and ancillary healthcare facilities, that are operated by qualified providers in their industries.

Portfolio of Properties

The Company conducts substantially all of its business through a wholly owned operating partnership, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership
(“Ventas Realty”) and an indirect, wholly owned limited liability company, Ventas Finance I, LLC (“Ventas Finance”). As of December 31, 2002, Ventas Finance owned 40 of the Company’s skilled nursing facilities, the Company
owned two hospitals and Ventas Realty owned all of the Company’s other properties and investments.

The following information provides an overview of the Company’s portfolio of healthcare properties and investments as of December 31,
2002:

(a)

Includes (i) revenue of $2.5 million related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of Ventas Realty’s receipt of Kindred Common Stock (as
defined below) and the amortization of the deferred revenue recorded from the receipt of $4.5 million of additional future rents under the leases with Kindred and (ii) $0.2 million from subleases under the Kindred Master Leases (as defined below).



(b)

Includes interest income from the THI Senior Loan (as defined below) and THI Mezzanine Loan (as defined below) entered into on November 4, 2002. The THI Senior Loan
was sold on December 27, 2002. Annualized interest on the THI Mezzanine Loan is approximately $3.0 million. The THI Mezzanine Loan is secured by a pledge of ownership interests in the entities that own the 17 skilled nursing facilities and one
assisted living facility that also collateralize the THI Senior Loan, plus liens on four additional healthcare/senior housing properties, and interests in three additional assets. On December 27, 2002, the Company sold the THI Senior Loan to GE
Capital Credit Corporation. See “—Recent Developments—THI Transaction” and “ —Sale of THI Senior Loan” below.

(c)

The Company has properties located in 37 states operated by five different operators.

Hospital Facilities

The Company’s hospitals generally are long-term acute care hospitals that serve medically complex,
chronically ill patients. The operator of these hospitals has the capability to treat patients who suffer from multiple systemic failures or conditions such as neurological disorders, head injuries, brain stem and spinal cord trauma, cerebral
vascular accidents, chemical brain injuries, central nervous system disorders, developmental anomalies and cardiopulmonary disorders. Chronic patients are often dependent on technology for continued life support, such as mechanical ventilators,
total parenteral nutrition, respiration or cardiac monitors and dialysis machines. While these patients suffer from conditions which require a high level of monitoring and specialized care, they may not necessitate the continued services of an
intensive care unit. Due to their severe medical conditions, these patients generally are not clinically appropriate for admission to a nursing facility or rehabilitation hospital.

The Company’s one 29 bed rehabilitation hospital provides high intensity physical, respiratory,
neurological, orthopedic and other treatment protocols for patients during recovery.

Nursing Facilities

The Company’s nursing facilities generally are skilled nursing facilities. In addition to the customary services provided by skilled nursing facilities, the operators of the Company’s nursing
facilities typically provide rehabilitation services, including physical, occupational and speech therapies.

Other Facilities

The Company’s eight personal care facilities serve persons with acquired or traumatic brain injury. The operator of the personal care
facilities provides services including supported living services, neurorehabilitation, neurobehavioral management and vocational programs. The Company owns one assisted living facility which provides residential care for the elderly, including
assistance with the daily activities of living.

Other Real Estate Investments

The Company has an investment in a mezzanine loan that is secured by (1) equity pledges in entities that own and operate 17 skilled nursing facilities and one related assisted living facility located in Ohio and Maryland, (2) liens
on four additional healthcare/senior living housing properties and (3) interests in three additional properties operated by the borrower. See “—Recent Developments—THI Transaction” below.



Geographic
Diversification

The Company’s
portfolio is broadly diversified by geographic location with rental and investment revenues from facilities with only one state comprising more than ten percent of the Company’s rental and investment revenues.

(a)

Includes (i) revenue of $2.5 million related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of Ventas Realty’s receipt of Kindred common stock and
the amortization of the deferred revenue recorded from the receipt of $4.5 million of additional future rents under the Kindred Master Leases (as defined below) and (ii) $0.2 million from subleases under the Kindred Master Leases.

Certificates of Need

In addition to the diversification of lease
rental revenues from the geographic diversification of the portfolio, the majority of the Company’s facilities are located in states that have certificate of need (“CON”) requirements. Some states require state approval for
development and expansion of healthcare facilities and services, including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. A CON, which is issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities,
is at times required for expansion of existing facilities, construction of new facilities, addition of beds, acquisition of major items of equipment or introduction of new services. The CON rules and regulations may restrict an operator’s
ability to expand the Company’s properties in certain circumstances.

Dependence on Kindred

For the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001, Kindred accounted for approximately 98.4% and 98.7% of the Company’s rental revenues, respectively. The Company’s reliance on Kindred is a result of a transaction in 1998 in which the Company was separated into two publicly held
corporations (the “1998 Spin Off”). A new corporation, subsequently named Vencor, Inc. (which has since been renamed Kindred Healthcare, Inc.), was formed to operate the hospital, nursing facility and ancillary services businesses, and the
Company retained substantially all of the real property which it leased to Kindred.



In addition,
as of December 31, 2002, the Company owned 920,814 shares of the outstanding common stock of Kindred (the “Kindred Common Stock”). The Company received shares of common stock in Kindred pursuant to the terms of Kindred’s plan of
reorganization (the “Kindred Reorganization Plan”) under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, as additional rent from Kindred.

Kindred Master Leases

The Company leases 43 of its hospitals and 210 of its nursing facilities to Kindred under five master lease agreements (the “Kindred
Master Leases”). Four of the Kindred Master Leases are with Ventas Realty, and the fifth (the “Kindred CMBS Master Lease”), which relates to 40 skilled nursing facilities, is with Ventas Finance.

Each Kindred Master Lease is a “triple-net lease” or
an “absolute-net lease” pursuant to which Kindred is required to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance and repairs related to the properties.

Under each Kindred Master Lease, the aggregate annual rent is referred to as Base Rent (as defined in each
Kindred Master Lease). The initial annual aggregate Base Rent was $180.7 million from May 1, 2001 to April 30, 2002. For the period from May 1, 2002 through April 30, 2004, Base Rent, payable all in cash, escalates on May 1 of each year at an
annual rate of 3.5% over the Prior Period Base Rent (as defined in the Kindred Master Leases) if certain Kindred revenue parameters are met. Assuming such Kindred revenue parameters are met, Base Rent under the Kindred Master Leases will be $192.4
million from May 1, 2003 to April 30, 2004. See “Note 3—Revenues from Properties” and “Note 11—Transactions with Kindred” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Each Kindred Master Lease provides that beginning May 1, 2004,
if Kindred refinances its senior secured indebtedness entered into in connection with the Kindred Reorganization Plan or takes other similar action (a “Kindred Refinancing”), the 3.5% annual escalator will be paid in cash. If a Kindred
Refinancing has not occurred, then beginning on May 1, 2004 and continuing until the occurrence of a Kindred Refinancing, the Base Rent will be comprised of (a) Current Rent (as defined in the Kindred Master Leases) payable in cash which will
escalate annually by an amount equal to 2% of Prior Period Base Rent, and (b) an additional annual non-cash accrued escalator amount of 1.5% of the Prior Period Base Rent.

There are several renewal bundles of properties under each Kindred Master Lease, with each bundle containing
a varying number of properties. Properties are renewable only in bundles. All properties within a bundle have primary terms ranging from 10 to 15 years commencing May 1, 1998, plus renewal options totaling fifteen years.

The Company has a one time right to reset the rents under the
Kindred Master Leases (the “Reset Right”), exercisable during a one-year period commencing July 19, 2006 by notice given on or after January 20, 2006 on a Kindred Master Lease by Kindred Master Lease basis, to a then fair market rental
rate, for a total fee of $5.0 million payable on a pro-rata basis at the time of exercise under the applicable Kindred Master Lease. The Reset Right under the Kindred CMBS Master Lease can only be exercised in conjunction with the exercise of
the Reset Right under Master Lease No. 1. The Company cannot exercise the Reset Right under the Kindred CMBS Master Lease without the prior written consent of the CMBS Lender if, as a result of such reset, the aggregate rent payable for the CMBS
Properties would decrease. See “Risk Factors—Risks Arising from the Company’s Business—The Company is dependent on Kindred; Kindred’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with the
Company could significantly harm the Company and its ability to service its indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to its stockholders as required to continue to quality as a REIT.”

Recent Developments

Kindred’s Increased Professional Liability Expense in
Florida

On October 10, 2002, Kindred
announced that it will record a substantial increase in costs related to professional liability claims, primarily claims related to skilled nursing facility operations conducted in Florida.



The annual cash rent from the 15 Florida skilled nursing facilities the Company leases to Kindred in Florida is approximately $8.5 million,
which constitutes approximately 4.6% of the total $186.0 million in annualized rent payable to the Company by Kindred. The Company believes that under the terms of its leases with Kindred, Kindred is not entitled to abandon the leased properties,
reduce the rent, or receive other concessions based on the increases in professional liability costs.

On December 11, 2002, Kindred publicly announced that it had entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Senior Health Management,
LLC (“Senior Health Management”) to transfer the operations of Kindred’s 18 skilled nursing facilities in Florida, including the 15 skilled nursing facilities in Florida that Kindred leases from the Company, and to sublease the
Company’s 15 facilities to Senior Health Management or its designee. The announcement indicated that consummation of the proposed transaction is subject to a number of material closing conditions, including approval from Kindred’s lenders
and regulatory and governmental approvals. Kindred stated that the lease payments under the proposed subleases would be equal to the lease payments under the primary leases and that Kindred will remain a primary obligor under the applicable lease
with the Company.

Based on the information
available to the Company, the Company believes its consent is required for the proposed sublease of the 15 skilled nursing facilities by Kindred. However, in its December 11, 2002 announcement, Kindred stated, among other things, that it has the
ability to sublease 12 of the skilled nursing facilities in Florida without the Company’s consent and that the Company’s consent cannot be unreasonably withheld on the remaining 3 skilled nursing facilities in Florida. Kindred further
stated that if the Company improperly interferes with the completion of the proposed transaction, it will seek appropriate legal remedies against the Company as well as damages for the continuing losses it is sustaining with respect to these
facilities. The Company believes that it has the right to consent to the proposed sublease of the 15 skilled nursing facilities in Florida held by Kindred, and intends to defend vigorously any legal actions arising out of its withholding of such
consent. However, there can be no assurance as to what the outcome of any such action on the part of Kindred might be or the ultimate effects it might have on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or the share price of the
Company’s common stock.

The Company has
been discussing strategic alternatives regarding the skilled nursing facilities in Florida with Kindred. The Company currently intends to work with Kindred to permit it to exit the Florida skilled nursing facility market on terms acceptable to the
Company. The Company is evaluating its alternatives in the event no agreement is reached with Kindred, including the initiation of legal proceedings. However, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of the Company’s discussions with Kindred
or when or if any exit by Kindred from the Florida skilled nursing facility market will occur.

As a result of Kindred’s October 10, 2002 announcement of its increased costs in Florida and other events, the market value of the Kindred Common Stock has declined substantially from $34.1
million as of September 30, 2002 to approximately $16.7 million as of December 31, 2002. The Company’s investment in Kindred Common Stock is classified as available for sale in accordance with SFAS No. 115 “Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” Accordingly, the Kindred Common Stock is measured and reported on the Company’s balance sheet at fair value. The Company’s unrealized gains and losses on the Kindred Common Stock are
reported as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the Company’s balance sheet.

THI Transaction

On November 4, 2002, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Ventas Realty, completed a $120.0 million transaction (the “THI
Transaction”) with Trans Healthcare, Inc., a privately owned long-term care and hospital company (“THI”). The THI Transaction was structured as a $53.0 million sale leaseback transaction (the “THI Sale Leaseback”) and a
$67.0 million loan (the “THI Loan”), comprised of a first mortgage loan (the “THI Senior Loan”) and a mezzanine loan (the “THI Mezzanine Loan”). Following a sale of the THI Senior Loan in December 2002 (see below) the
Company’s investment in THI was $70.0 million.



As part of the
THI Sale Leaseback, Ventas Realty purchased 5 properties and is leasing them back to THI under a “triple-net” master lease (the “THI Master Lease”). The properties subject to the THI Sale Leaseback are four skilled nursing
facilities and one Care Campus that is comprised of one skilled nursing facility, one rehabilitation hospital, and one assisted living facility. Three of the properties are located in Maryland and two are located in Ohio. These properties contain a
total of 770 beds. The THI Master Lease, which has an initial term of ten years, provides for annual base rent of $5.9 million. The THI Master Lease provides that if THI meets specified revenue parameters, annual base rent will escalate each year by
the greater of (i) three percent or (ii) 50% of the consumer price index.

The THI Senior Loan, with an outstanding balance of approximately $50.0 million on December 27, 2002, is secured by 17 skilled nursing facilities and one related assisted living facility. Fourteen of
these properties are located in Ohio and four are located in Maryland. These properties contain a total of 1,402 beds. The THI Senior Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 367 basis points, inclusive of upfront fees (with a LIBOR floor of three
percent). The THI Senior Loan matures in three years, and THI holds options to exercise two one-year extensions upon satisfaction of certain conditions.

The THI Mezzanine Loan, with a current principal balance of approximately $17.0 million, bears interest, inclusive of upfront fees, of 18%
per annum and is secured by equity pledges in THI and certain of its subsidiaries that own and operate the 18 facilities that also collateralize the THI Senior Loan, liens on four additional healthcare/senior housing properties, and interests in
three additional properties operated by THI. The THI Transaction collectively covers a total of 32 facilities: 18 skilled nursing facilities, four assisted living facilities, and one rehabilitation hospital containing 1,546 beds in Ohio; and nine
skilled nursing facilities containing 1,206 beds in Maryland. Annualized interest on the THI Mezzanine Loan is expected to be approximately $3.0 million. The Company funded the transaction by drawing on its revolving credit facility under its Second
Amended and Restated Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2002 (the “2002 Credit Agreement”).

Sale of THI Senior Loan

On December 27, 2002, the Company sold the THI Senior Loan to GE Capital Credit Corporation (“GECC”), generating net proceeds of
$49.0 million, recognizing a small gain as a result of the sale.

Liquidity

See the
section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments Regarding Liquidity” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company’s 2002
Credit Agreement, Senior Notes Offering and Equity Offering.

Competition

The Company
competes for real property investments with healthcare providers, other healthcare-related REITs, healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance companies and other investors. Many of the Company’s competitors are significantly
larger and have greater financial resources and lower cost of capital than the Company. The Company’s ability to compete successfully for real property investments will be determined by numerous factors, including the ability of the Company to
identify suitable acquisition or investment targets, the ability of the Company to negotiate acceptable terms for any such acquisition, the availability and cost of capital to the Company. See “Risk Factors—Risks Arising From the
Company’s Business—The Company may encounter certain risks and financing constraints when implementing its business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, healthcare-related and/or senior housing
properties” and “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The operators of the Company’s properties compete on a local and regional basis with other healthcare operators. The ability of the
Company’s operators to compete successfully for patients at the Company’s



facilities depends upon several factors, including the quality of care at the facility, the operational reputation of the operator, physician
referral patterns, physical appearance of the facilities, other competitive systems of healthcare delivery within the community, population and demographics, and the financial condition of the operator. Private, federal and state reimbursement
programs and the effect of other laws and regulations also may have a significant effect on the Company’s operators to compete successfully for patients for the properties. See “Risk Factors—Changes in the reimbursement rates or
methods of payment from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s tenants.”

Employees

As of December 31, 2002, the Company had 20 full-time employees and three part-time employees. The Company considers its relationship with
its employees to be good.

Insurance

The Company maintains and/or requires in its leases that its
tenants maintain liability and casualty insurance on its assets and operations. Under the Kindred Master Leases, Kindred is required to maintain, at its expense, certain insurance coverage related to the properties under the Kindred Master Leases
and Kindred’s operations at the related facilities. See “—Dependence on Kindred—Kindred Master Leases” and “—Recent Developments—Kindred’s Increased Professional Liability Expense in Florida.” There
can be no assurance that Kindred and the Company’s other tenants will maintain such insurance and any failure by Kindred or the Company’s other tenants to do so could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition,
results of operation and liquidity of the Company and on the Company’s ability to service its indebtedness and its obligations under the United States Settlement (as defined in “Note 11—Transactions with Kindred—Settlement of
United States Claims” to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and on the Company’s ability to make distributions to its stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT (a “Material Adverse Effect”). The Company
believes that Kindred and its other tenants are in substantial compliance with the insurance requirements contained in their respective leases with the Company.

The Company believes that the amount and coverage of its insurance protection is customary for similarly
situated companies in its industry. There can be no assurance that in the future such insurance will be available at a reasonable price or that the Company will be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance coverage.

Due to the increase in the number and severity of professional
liability claims against healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has been severely restricted and the premiums for such insurance coverage has increased dramatically. As a result, many healthcare operators may
incur large funded and unfunded professional liability expense, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of the healthcare providers. In addition, many healthcare providers are
pursuing different organizational and corporate structures coupled with insurance programs that provide less insurance coverage. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company’s tenants will continue to carry the insurance coverage
required under the terms of the Company’s leases, or that the Company will continue to require the same levels of insurance under its leases.

Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the Commission.



GOVERNMENTAL
REGULATION

Healthcare Regulation

General

The operators of the Company’s properties derive a
substantial portion of their revenues from third party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, certain disabled
persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a medical assistance program jointly funded by federal and state governments and administered by each state pursuant to which benefits are available to certain indigent patients. The
Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework is subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion that affect the amount and timing of reimbursement made under Medicare and Medicaid. The amounts of program payments received by the
Company’s operators and tenants can be changed by legislative or regulatory actions and by determinations by agents for the programs. See “—Healthcare Reform.” In addition, private payors, including managed care payors,
increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk. Efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon operators by private payors are
expected to continue. There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be available for services to be provided by the operators of the Company’s properties which currently are being reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid
and private payors. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on these operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could affect
adversely their ability to make rental payments to the Company.

The operators of the Company’s properties are subject to other extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to licensure, conduct of operations, ownership
of facilities, addition of facilities, services, prices for services and billing for services. These laws authorize periodic inspections and investigations, and identification of deficiencies that, if not corrected, can result in sanctions that
include loss of licensure to operate and loss of rights to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Regulatory agencies have substantial powers to affect the actions of operators of the Company’s properties if the agencies believe
that there is an imminent threat to patient welfare, and in some states these powers can include assumption of interim control over facilities through receiverships.

Certificates of Need

Some states require state approval for development and expansion of healthcare facilities and services,
including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. A CON is issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities and is at times required for expansion of existing facilities,
construction of new facilities, addition of beds, acquisition of major items of equipment or introduction of new services. The CON rules and regulations may restrict an operator’s ability to expand the Company’s properties in certain
circumstances.

In the event that any operator of
the Company’s properties fails to make rental payments to the Company or to comply with the applicable healthcare regulations, and, in either case, such operators or their lenders fail to cure the default prior to the expiration of the
applicable cure period, the ability of the Company to evict that operator and substitute another operator or operators may be materially delayed or limited by various state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by Medicare and
Medicaid change-of-ownership rules. Such delays and limitations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to collect rent, to obtain possession of leased properties, or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant default. In
addition, the Company may also incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any such licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings.



Fraud and
Abuse

Federal anti-kickback laws codified
under Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the “Anti-kickback Laws”) prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid and
other federal healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by Medicare or other governmental programs. Sanctions for violating the Anti-kickback Laws include criminal
penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and possible exclusion from government programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In the ordinary course of its business, the operators of the Company’s properties have been and are
subject regularly to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. Pursuant to the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987, the United States Department of Health
and Human Services (“HHS”) periodically has issued regulations that describe some of the conduct and business relationships permissible under the Anti-kickback Laws (“Safe Harbors”). The fact that a given business arrangement
does not fall within a Safe Harbor does not render the arrangement per se illegal. Business arrangements of healthcare service providers that fail to satisfy the applicable Safe Harbor’s criteria, however, risk increased scrutiny and possible
sanctions by enforcement authorities.

The
Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (“Budget Act”) also provides a number of additional anti-fraud and abuse provisions. The Budget Act contains new civil monetary penalties for an operator’s violation of the Anti-kickback Laws and imposes an
affirmative duty on operators to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the Medicare and other government programs. The Budget Act also provides a minimum ten-year period for exclusion from participation in federal
healthcare programs for operators convicted of a prior healthcare offense.

The operators of the Company’s properties also are subject to the Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the Stark Law. In the absence of an applicable exception, the
Stark Law prohibits referrals by physicians of Medicare and other government-program patients to providers of a broad range of designated healthcare services with which the physicians (or their immediate family members) have ownership interests or
certain other financial arrangements. The Stark Law’s self-referral prohibition includes inpatient and outpatient hospital services. Many states have adopted or are considering legislative proposals similar to the federal referral prohibition,
some of which extend beyond the Medicare and Medicaid programs to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self-referrals regardless of whether the service was reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid. A
violation of such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on these operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments to the Company.

Government investigations and enforcement of
healthcare laws has increased dramatically over the past several years and is expected to continue. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which became effective January 1, 1997, greatly expanded the
definition of healthcare fraud and related offenses and broadened the scope to include private healthcare plans in addition to government payors. HIPAA also greatly increased funding for the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
and the Office of the Inspector General to audit, investigate and prosecute suspected healthcare fraud. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud also has increased due in large part to amendments to the civil False Claims Act in 1986 that were
designed to encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits by private individuals, known as qui tam relators, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former patients and nurses and other
employees.

Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals

Substantially all of the Company’s
hospitals are operated as long-term acute care hospitals (“LTACs”), which are hospitals that have an average length of stay greater than 25 days. In order to receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, each hospital must meet the
applicable conditions of participation set forth by the



United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) relating to the type of hospital, its equipment, personnel and
standard of medical care, as well as comply with state and local laws and regulations. Hospitals undergo periodic on-site certification surveys, which generally are limited if the hospital is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations (“JCAHO”) or other recognized accreditation organizations. A loss of certification could adversely affect a hospital’s ability to receive payments from Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could in turn
adversely impact the operator’s ability to make rental payments under its leases with the Company. See “—Healthcare Reform.”

Skilled Nursing Facilities

The operators of the Company’s nursing facilities generally are licensed on an annual or bi-annual basis and certified annually for
participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs through various regulatory agencies which determine compliance with federal, state and local laws. These legal requirements relate to the quality of the nursing care provided, qualifications of the
administrative personnel and nursing staff, the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment and continuing compliance with the laws and regulations governing the operation of nursing facilities. See “—Healthcare Reform.”

Healthcare Reform

Healthcare is one of the largest industries in the United
States and continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention. In an effort to reduce federal spending on healthcare, in 1997 the federal government enacted the Budget Act, which contained extensive changes to the Medicare and
Medicaid programs, including substantial reimbursement reductions for healthcare operations. For certain healthcare providers, including hospitals and skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”), implementation of the Budget Act resulted in more
drastic reimbursement reductions than had been anticipated. In addition to its impact on Medicare, the Budget Act also afforded states more flexibility in administering their Medicaid plans, including the ability to shift most Medicaid enrollees
into managed care plans without first obtaining a federal waiver. Accordingly, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including payment levels and methods, are in a state of change and are less predictable than before enactment of the Budget Act.

Medicare Reimbursement; Skilled Nursing
Facilities

The Budget Act established a
prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities (“SNF PPS”). Under the SNF PPS, payment amounts are based upon classifications determined through assessments of individual Medicare patients in the skilled nursing facility, rather
than on the facility’s reasonable costs. The payments received under the SNF PPS are intended generally to cover all inpatient services for Medicare patients, including routine nursing care, most capital-related costs associated with the
inpatient stay, and ancillary services, such as respiratory therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and certain covered drugs.

Under the SNF PPS, per diem payments are made to nursing home facilities for each resident. Upon the expiration of the three-year
transition period, these per diem payments were fully transitioned into the federal SNF PPS rates. During the transition period, payments were based on a blended rate that uses both a facility-specific rate and the federal rate. As a result of SNF
PPS, Medicare payments to SNFs dropped by 12.5% in 1999. Although there has been some payment relief (as described below), certain of the payment relief provisions have expired and there can be no assurance that the current reimbursement levels
under the SNF PPS will continue or be sufficient to permit the Company’s operators to satisfy their obligations, including payment of rent under their leases with the Company.

In response to widespread healthcare industry concern about the effects of the Budget Act, the federal
government enacted the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (“Refinement Act”) on November 29, 1999. The Refinement Act did not enact any fundamental changes in the Medicare system, but rather reversed or delayed some of the reductions
in Medicare payment increases mandated by the Budget Act. It was estimated



that in the four to five fiscal years after its enactment, the Refinement Act would return to healthcare providers approximately $16 billion
of the $115 billion the Budget Act was expected to cut from increases to the Medicare program. Specific providers who received relief under the Refinement Act included SNFs, which received temporary (effective April 1, 2000 to October 1, 2000) per
diem payment increases for certain high cost patients, and outpatient rehabilitation therapy providers, which received a 2-year moratorium on the annual cap on the amount of physical, occupational and speech therapy provided to a patient.

Passed in December 2000, the Benefits
Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (“BIPA”) provided a certain degree of relief from the projected impact of the Budget Act. Specifically, BIPA modified the impact of the Refinement Act on SNF PPS payment rates, as implemented by the
Final Refinement Act Rule, in several important ways. First, BIPA revised the annual market basket update factor upward from “market basket—1%” to (a) “market basket” in federal fiscal year 2001, and (b) “market
basket— 0.5%” in federal fiscal years 2002 and 2003. Second, BIPA temporarily increased the nursing component of the federal SNF PPS rate by 16.66%, from April 1, 2001 through September 30, 2002. Third, BIPA increased the per diem
reimbursement rates for fourteen rehabilitation-related patient categories groups by 6.7%, from April 1, 2001 until such time as case-mix refinements are implemented pursuant to the Refinement Act. Finally, BIPA and the Refinement Act extended the
moratorium on the annual therapy cap to December 31, 2002, although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) subsequently delayed implementation of the annual therapy cap until July 1, 2003.

Under the Medicare provisions of the Refinement Act and BIPA,
SNFs received a 20% increase in the per diem reimbursement rates for certain medically complex patient categories and a 6.7% increase to the per diem reimbursement rates for 14 rehabilitation-related patient categories. Under applicable law,
however, the 6.7% add-on for rehabilitation patients and the 20% add-on for medically complex patients is to expire when CMS implements certain refinements to the SNF PPS. On April 23, 2002, HHS indicated that CMS will not implement these
refinements for federal fiscal year 2003. As a result, at this time the 6.7% increase and the 20% add-on will be retained. In addition, the President’s proposed 2003 budget acknowledges that the funding for the 6.7% increase and the 20% add-on
will continue until at least the end of fiscal year 2004. However, there can be no assurance that the funding for the 6.7% increase or the 20% add-on will continue through at least the end of fiscal year 2004. The 16.66% temporary increase in the
nursing component of the federal SNF PPS rate and the 4% temporary add-on for all patient categories provided under the Refinement Act and BIPA expired on September 30, 2002.

On July 31, 2002, CMS published the SNF payment rates for the 2003 federal fiscal year. Under the update,
SNFs receive a 2.6% increase in Medicare payments for the 2003 federal fiscal year. According to CMS, this increase will result in nearly $400 million more in annual payments to nursing facilities. The update also incorporates HHS’s April 23,
2002 decision to leave in place for the present time the current case-mix classification. This decision will, according to CMS, result in nursing homes continuing to receive an estimated $1 billion in temporary add-on payments in the 2003
federal fiscal year.

The 2.6% increase is
offset, however, by the expiration of the 16.66% temporary increase in the nursing component of the federal SNF PPS rate and the 4% temporary add-on for all patient categories discussed above. CMS states that the expiration of these two temporary
add-ons will result in a decrease in SNF payments of about $1.4 billion for the 2003 federal fiscal year. According to CMS, the combined effect of the 2.6% increase under the 2003 Payment Update and the expiration of the two temporary add-ons
is an estimated net decrease of $1 billion in nursing facility payments for the 2003 federal fiscal year.

Medicaid Reimbursement; Skilled Nursing Facilities

Approximately two-thirds of all nursing home residents are dependent on Medicaid. Medicaid reimbursement
rates, however, typically are less than the amounts charged by the operators of the Company’s properties. Moreover, rising Medicaid costs and decreasing state revenues caused by current economic conditions have prompted an increasing number of
states to consider reductions in Medicaid funding as a means of



balancing their respective state budgets. Existing and future initiatives affecting Medicaid reimbursement may reduce utilization of (and
reimbursement for) services offered by the operators of the Company’s properties.

On March 25, 1999, legislation was passed that prevents nursing facility operators that decide to withdraw from the Medicaid program from evicting or transferring patients who are residents as of the
effective date of withdrawal, and who rely on Medicaid to cover their long-term care expenses. In addition, the Budget Act repealed the “Boren Amendment” federal payment standard for Medicaid payments to hospitals and nursing facilities
effective October 1, 1997, giving states greater latitude in setting payment rates for these providers.

CMS also has promulgated a final regulation (“Final Regulation”) to restrict the “upper-payment limit loophole” in
Medicaid. The Final Regulation revises a provision of a prior regulation published on January 12, 2001 that allowed states to make overall payments to public non-state government owned or operated hospitals of up to 150% of the estimated amount
that would be paid under Medicare for the same services. Under the Final Regulation, these payments are limited to 100% of estimated Medicare payments, which is the limit for all other hospitals. The resulting effect of the Final Regulation is that
states may implement rate or service cuts to providers (including SNFs) to compensate for reduced federal funding. According to CMS, the Final Regulation became effective on May 15, 2002. The Company cannot predict the impact of the Final Regulation
on the Company’s tenants and operators.

In
early 2003, many states announced actual or potential budget shortfalls. As a result of these budget shortfalls, many states have announced that they are implementing or considering implementing “freezes” or cuts in Medicaid rates paid to
SNF providers. It is premature to assess whether significant Medicaid rate freezes or cuts will be adopted, and if so, by how many states or the impact of such action on the Company’s operators. However, severe and widespread Medicaid rate cuts
or freezes could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments to the Company.

Medicare Reimbursement; Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals

The Budget Act also affected the payments
made to LTACs by reducing the amount of reimbursement for incentive payments established pursuant to the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, for capital expenditures and bad debts, and for services to certain patients transferred from
an acute care hospital. In addition, the Budget Act for the first time imposed a national ceiling limitation or “national cap” on payments that may be made in each category of hospitals exempt from a prospective payment system. LTACs
previously constituted one such category. The Budget Act, however, mandated the creation of a prospective payment system for LTACs (“LTAC PPS”), which became effective on October 1, 2002 for LTAC cost report periods commencing on or after
October 1, 2002.

Pursuant to the Budget Act and
the Medicare provisions of the Refinement Act and BIPA, LTACs are transitioning to LTAC PPS, which classifies patients into distinct diagnostic groups based on clinical characteristics and expected resource needs.

Once fully transitioned to LTAC PPS, LTACs will no longer be
reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis that reflects costs incurred, but rather on a predetermined rate. Under LTAC PPS, payment for a Medicare beneficiary is made at a predetermined, per discharge amount for each of 510 patient categories, adjusted
for differences in area wage levels. LTAC PPS includes payment for all inpatient operating and capital costs of furnishing covered services (including routine and ancillary services), but not certain pass through costs, which include bad debts,
direct medical education, and blood clotting factors. Unlike the prospective payment system for inpatient acute care hospitals, LTAC PPS makes no adjustments for geographic reclassification, disproportionate share of low-income patients, rural
location, or indirect medical education.

Updates
to the prospective payment rates for each federal fiscal year will be published annually. For LTACs that have filed cost reports before October 1, 2002, a 5-year phase-in period has been implemented to gradually



transition such LTACs from cost-based reimbursement to 100 percent federal prospective payment under LTAC PPS. At the beginning of any cost
reporting period during the phase-in, such LTACs may exercise a one-time, non-revocable election to transition fully to LTAC PPS rate.

According to CMS, LTAC PPS is required by law to be “budget neutral,” which means that total payments under LTAC PPS must equal
the amount that would have been paid if the system had not been implemented. The Company is currently analyzing the effects of the final LTAC PPS rule and cannot predict the impact of LTAC PPS on the Company’s tenants and operators. The Company
believes that LTAC PPS will impact Kindred no sooner than September 1, 2003.

Nursing Home Quality Initiative

In 2002 HHS launched the Nursing Home Quality Initiative program. This program, which is designed to provide consumers with comparative information about nursing home quality measures, rates nursing
homes on various quality of care indicators. If the operators of the Company’s properties are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or superior to those of their competitors, patients may choose alternate facilities,
which could cause operating revenues to decline. In the event the financial condition or operating revenues of these operators adversely affected, the operators’ ability to make rental payments to the Company could be adversely affected, which,
in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

There can be no assurance that future healthcare legislation or changes in the administration or implementation of governmental healthcare reimbursement programs will not have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company’s operators and tenants which could have a material adverse effect on their ability to make rental payments to the Company which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Environmental Regulation

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws,
ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property from which there is a release or threatened release of hazardous or toxic substances or an entity that arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic
substances at a disposal site may be held jointly and severally liable for the cost of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances that could be located on, in or under such property or other affected property. Such laws and
regulations often impose liability whether or not the owner, operator or otherwise responsible party knew of, or caused the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of any required remediation or removal of these substances could be
substantial, and the liability of a responsible party as to any property is generally not limited under such laws and regulations and could exceed the property’s value and the aggregate assets of the liable party. The presence of these
substances or failure to remediate such substances properly also may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent the property, or to borrow using the property as collateral. In connection with the ownership and leasing of the
Company’s properties, the Company could be liable for these costs as well as certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to person or properties or natural resources. In addition, owners and operators of real property are
liable for the costs of complying with environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances and regulations and can be subjected to penalties for failure to comply. Such ongoing compliance costs and penalties for non-compliance can be substantial.
Changes to existing or the adoption of new environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances, and regulations could substantially increase an owner’s or operator’s environmental, health, and safety compliance costs and/or associated
liabilities. Environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances, and regulations potentially affecting the Company address a wide variety of topics, including, but not limited to, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (“PCBs”), fuel oil
management, wastewater discharges, air emissions, radioactive materials, medical wastes, and hazardous wastes. The Company is generally indemnified by the current operators of its properties for contamination caused by such operators. Under the
Kindred Master Leases, Kindred has agreed to indemnify the Company against any environmental claims (including penalties and clean-up costs) resulting from any condition arising in, on or



under, or relating to, the leased properties at any time on or after the commencement date of the lease term for the applicable leased
property. Kindred also has agreed to indemnify the Company against any environmental claim (including penalties and clean up costs) resulting from any condition permitted to deteriorate, on or after the commencement date of the lease term for the
applicable leased property (including as a result of migration from adjacent properties not owned or operated by the Company or any of its affiliates other than Kindred and its direct affiliates). There can be no assurance that Kindred or another
operator will have the financial capability or the willingness to satisfy any such environmental claims. See “Risk Factors—Risks Arising from the Company’s Business—The Company is dependent on Kindred; Kindred’s inability or
unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with the Company could significantly harm the Company and its ability to service its indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to its stockholders as required to
continue to qualify as a REIT.” If Kindred or another operator is unable or unwilling to satisfy such claims, the Company may be required to satisfy the claims. The Company has agreed to indemnify Kindred against any environmental claims
(including penalties and clean-up costs) resulting from any condition arising on or under, or relating to, the leased properties at any time before the commencement date of the lease term for the applicable leased property.

See “Risk Factors—If any of the Company’s
properties are found to be contaminated, or if the Company becomes involved in any environmental disputes, the Company could incur substantial liabilities and costs.”

The Company did not make any material capital expenditures in connection with such environmental, health, and
safety laws, ordinances, and regulations in 2002 and does not expect that it will have to make any such material capital expenditures during 2003.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

The discussion of “Federal Income Tax Considerations” set forth herein is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations and
is not tax advice. Moreover, this summary does not deal with all tax aspects that might be relevant to a particular stockholder in light of such stockholder’s circumstances, nor does it deal with particular types of stockholders that are
subject to special treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), such as insurance companies, financial institutions and broker-dealers. The Code provisions governing the federal income tax treatment of REITs
are highly technical and complex, and this summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable Code provisions, rules and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof. The following
discussion is based on current law, which could be changed at any time, possibly retroactively.

Federal Income Taxation of the Company

The Company elected REIT status beginning with the year ended December 31, 1999. Beginning with the 1999 tax year, the Company believes that it has satisfied the requirements to qualify as a REIT. The
Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2003 and subsequent years. If the Company continues to qualify for taxation as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to federal
corporate income tax on net income that it currently distributes to stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” (i.e., taxation at both the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results from
investment in a corporation.

Notwithstanding its
qualification as a REIT, the Company will be subject to federal income tax on any undistributed taxable income, including undistributed net capital gains at regular corporate rates. In addition, the Company will be subject to a 4% excise tax if it
does not satisfy specific REIT distribution requirements. See “—Requirements for Qualification—Annual Distribution Requirements.” The Company may be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on its undistributed items of
tax preference. If the Company has (i) net income from the sale or other disposition of “foreclosure property” (see below) that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or (ii) other non-qualifying income
from foreclosure property, it will be subject to



tax at the highest corporate rate on such income. See “—Requirements for Qualification—Asset Tests.” In addition, if the
Company has net income from “prohibited transactions” (which are, in general, certain sales or other dispositions of property (other than foreclosure property) held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business), such
income will be subject to a 100% tax.

The
Company may also be subject to “Built-in Gains Tax” on any appreciated asset that it owns or acquires that was previously owned by a C corporation (i.e., a corporation generally subject to full corporate level tax). The Company owns
appreciated assets that it held on January 1, 1999, the effective date of its REIT election. These assets are subject to the Built-in Gain Tax rules because the Company was a taxable C corporation prior to January 1, 1999. If the Company disposes of
any of these assets and the Company recognizes gain on the disposition of such asset during the 10-year period (the “Recognition Period”), then, the Company generally will be subject to regular corporate income tax on the gain equal to the
lower of (a) the recognized gain at the time of the disposition or (b) the Built-in Gain in that asset as of January 1, 1999. The total amount of gain on which the Company can be taxed under the Built-in Gain Rules is limited to its net built-in
gain at the time it became a REIT, i.e., the excess of the aggregate fair market value of its assets at the time it became a REIT over the adjusted tax bases of those assets at that time. Some but not all of such capital gains realized would be
offset by the amount of any available capital loss carryforwards (which expire December 31, 2003). In connection with the sale of any assets, all or a portion of such gain could be treated as ordinary income instead of capital gain and be subject to
taxation and/or the minimum REIT distribution requirements.

See “—Requirements for Qualification” below for other circumstances in which the Company may be required to pay federal taxes.

Requirements for Qualification

To continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company must continue to meet the requirements discussed below, relating to the Company’s
organization, sources of income, nature of assets and distributions of income to stockholders.

Organizational Requirements

The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association (i) that is managed by one or more directors or trustees; (ii) the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by
transferable certificates of beneficial interest; (iii) that would be taxable as a domestic corporation, but for Sections 856 through 859 of the Code; (iv) that is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain
provisions of the Code; (v) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year (the “100 Shareholder
Rule”); (vi) not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) during the last half of each taxable year (the
“5/50 Rule”); (vii) that makes an election to be a REIT (or has made such election for a previous taxable year) and satisfies all relevant filing and other administrative requirements established by the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) that must be met in order to elect and to maintain REIT status; (viii) that uses a calendar year for federal income tax purposes; and (ix) that meets certain other tests, described below, regarding the nature of its income and
assets.

The Company believes that it has
satisfied the organizational requirements and believes it will continue to do so in the future. In order to prevent a concentration of ownership of the Company’s stock that would cause the Company to fail the 5/50 Rule or the 100 Shareholder
Rule, the Company has placed certain restrictions on the transfer of its shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership. However, such restrictions may not prevent the Company from failing to meet these requirements,
and thereby failing to qualify as a REIT.



In addition,
to qualify as a REIT, a corporation may not have (as of the end of the taxable year) any earnings and profits that were accumulated in periods before it elected REIT status. The Company believes that at December 31, 1999 it did not have any
accumulated earnings and profits that are attributable to periods during which the Company was not a REIT, although the IRS would be entitled to challenge that determination.

Gross Income Tests

To continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company must satisfy two annual gross income requirements. First, at
least 75% of the Company’s gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must consist of defined types of income derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages
on real property (including pledges of equity interest in certain entities holding real property and also including “rents from real property” (defined below)) and, in certain circumstances, interest on certain types of temporary
investment income. Second, at least 95% of the Company’s gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must be derived from such real property or temporary investments, dividends, interest and gain
from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, or from any combination of the foregoing. To qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests, rental payments must generally be received from unrelated
persons and not be based on the net income of the tenant. Also, the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15% of the total rent. Further, the Company generally must not operate or manage the property or furnish or render services to
the tenants of such property, other than through an “independent contractor” who is adequately compensated and from whom the Company derives no income (a demimimis exception is allowed for noncustomary services provided by the Company if
the annual value of does not exceed 1% of the gross income derived from the property).

Amounts received from a tenant will not qualify as “rents from real property” if the Company, or an owner of 10% or more of the Company, directly or constructively is deemed to own 10% or
more of the ownership interests in the tenant (a “Related Party Tenant”).

The Company does not believe that it has, and does not anticipate that it will in the future, (i) charged/charge rent that is based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person (except by
reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales consistent with the rule described above), (ii) derived/derive rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with real property that exceeds 15% of
the total rents, (iii) derived/derive rent attributable to a Related Party Tenant, or (iv) provided/provide any noncustomary services to tenants other than through qualifying independent contractors, except as permitted by the 1% de minimis
exception or to the extent that the amount of resulting nonqualifying income would not cause the Company to fail to satisfy the 95% and 75% gross income tests. The Company believes it has been and will continue to be in compliance with the gross
income tests. However, there can be no assurance that the Company is or will continue to be in compliance with the gross income tests.

If the Company fails to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, it may nevertheless continue to
qualify as a REIT for such year if it is entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. These relief provisions generally will be available if the Company’s failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful
neglect, the Company attaches a schedule of the sources of its income to its return and any incorrect information on the schedules was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax. It is not possible, however, to state whether in all circumstances the
Company would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. Even if these relief provisions were to apply, a 100% tax would be imposed with respect to the excess net income.

Asset Tests

At the close of each quarter of its taxable year, the Company must satisfy two tests relating to the nature of its assets. First, at least
75% of the value of the Company’s total assets must be represented by cash or cash



items (including certain receivables), government securities, “real estate assets” or, in cases where the Company raises new
capital through stock or long-term (maturity of at least five years) debt offerings, temporary investments in stock or debt instruments during the one-year period following the Company’s receipt of such capital (the “75% asset test”).
The term “real estate asset” includes interests in real property, interests in mortgages on real property to the extent the mortgage balance does not exceed the value of the associated real property, and shares of other REITs. For purposes
of the 75% asset test, the term “interest in real property” includes an interest in land and improvements thereon, such as buildings or other inherently permanent structures (including items that are structural components of such buildings
or structures), a leasehold in real property and an option to acquire real property (or a leasehold in real property). Second, of the investments not included in the 75% asset class, the value of any one issuer’s debt and equity securities
owned by the Company (other than the Company’s interest in any entity classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, the stock of a Taxable REIT Subsidiary (as defined below) or the stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary) may not
exceed 5% of the value of the Company’s total assets (the “5% asset test”), and the Company may not own more than 10% of any one issuer’s outstanding voting securities or 10% of the value of any one issuer’s outstanding
securities, subject to limited “safe harbor” exceptions for certain straight debt obligations (except for the Company’s ownership interest in an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes, that is classified as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes or that is the stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary) (the “10% securities test”). In addition, no more than 20% of the value of the Company’s assets can be represented by securities of
Taxable REIT Subsidiaries.

If the Company should
fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter except for its first calendar quarter, such a failure would not cause it to fail to qualify as a REIT or to lose its REIT status if (i) it satisfied all of the asset tests at the close
of the preceding calendar quarter and (ii) the discrepancy between the value of the Company’s assets and the asset test requirements arose from changes in the market values of its assets and was not wholly or partly caused by an acquisition of
nonqualifying assets. If the condition described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence were not satisfied, the Company still could avoid disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy within 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter in
which it arose. The Company intends to maintain adequate records of the value of its assets to ensure compliance with the asset tests and to take such other actions as may be required to comply with those tests.

The Company believes it has been and will continue to be in
compliance with the 10% securities test and the 5% asset test. There can be no assurance the Company is or will continue to be in compliance with either of these tests. If the Company failed to satisfy either of these tests, the Company would lose
its REIT status. If the Company lost its status as a REIT, it would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Related Party Tenant

The Company leases substantially all of its properties to Kindred and Kindred is the primary source of the Company’s rental revenues.
Under the Kindred Reorganization Plan, Ventas Realty received 1,498,500 shares of Kindred Common Stock on the Kindred Effective Date. Under the Code, if the Company owns 10% or more of any class of Kindred’s issued and outstanding voting
securities or 10% or more of the value of any class of Kindred’s issued and outstanding securities (previously defined as the “10% securities test”), Kindred would be a Related Party Tenant. As a Related Party Tenant, the
Company’s rental revenue from Kindred would not qualify as “rents from real property” and the Company would lose its REIT status because it likely would not be able to satisfy either the 75% or the 95% gross income test. The
Company’s loss of REIT status would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Since the Kindred Effective Date, Ventas Realty has disposed of 577,686 shares of its Kindred Common Stock. As of December 31, 2002, the Company owned 920,814 shares of Kindred Common Stock or not more
than 5.2% of the 17,648,857 issued and outstanding shares of Kindred. Based upon applicable tax authorities and decisions and advice from the IRS, the Company believes that for purposes of the 10% securities test, its ownership percentage in Kindred
has been and will continue to be less than 9.99%.



A number of
safeguards are in place to reduce the risk of the Company’s violation of the 10% securities test as a result of its ownership of Kindred common stock. While the Company believes that these safeguards are adequate, there can be no assurances
that such safeguards will be adequate to prevent the Company from violating the 10% securities test. If the Company should ever violate the 10% securities test, the Company would lose its status as a REIT which would have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

Foreclosure Property

The foreclosure property rules permit the
Company (by the Company’s election) to foreclose or repossess properties without being disqualified as a result of receiving income that does not qualify under the gross income tests; however, a corporate tax is imposed upon net income from
“foreclosure property” that is not otherwise “good REIT” income. Detailed rules specify the calculation of the tax. The after tax amount increases the amount the REIT must distribute each year.

“Foreclosure property” includes any real property
and any personal property incident to such real property acquired by bid at foreclosure or by agreement or process of law after there was a default or a default was imminent on the leased property. However, for qualified healthcare properties, the
Company is permitted to terminate leases other than by reason of default or imminent default. During a 90-day grace period, the Company may operate the foreclosed property without an “independent contractor” or qualifying lessee. The
90-day grace period will begin on the date the Company acquires possession of the property.

To maintain foreclosure property treatment after the 90 day grace period, the Company must cause the property to be managed by an “independent contractor” (from whom the Company derives or
receives no income) or lease the property pursuant to a lease qualifying as a true lease for income tax purposes to an unrelated third party. Ownership of the tenant must not be attributed to the Company in violation of the related tenant rule of
Section 856(d)(2)(B) (relating to 10% or more owned tenants). If the property is leased to a third party under a true lease, the foreclosure property rules are not then relevant.

Foreclosure property treatment will end on the first day on which the REIT enters into a lease of the
property that will give rise to income that is not good rental income under Section 856(c)(3). In addition, foreclosure property treatment will end if any construction takes place on the property (other than completion of a building, or other
improvement more than 10 percent complete before default became imminent). Foreclosure property treatment is available for an initial period of three years and may be extended up to six years. Foreclosure property treatment for qualified healthcare
property is available for an initial period of two years and may be extended up to six years.

Taxable REIT Subsidiaries

The Company is permitted to own up to 100% of a “taxable REIT subsidiary” or a “TRS”. Tax legislation implemented TRS Rules to allow REITs to have greater flexibility in engaging in
activities, which previously had been prohibited by REIT rules. TRSs are corporations subject to tax as a regular “C” corporation. Generally, a taxable REIT subsidiary can own assets that cannot be owned by a REIT and can perform otherwise
impermissible tenant services (excluding the direct or indirect operation or management of a lodging or healthcare facility) which would otherwise disqualify the REIT’s rental income under the REIT income tests. In enacting the taxable REIT
subsidiary rules, Congress intended that the arrangements between a REIT and its taxable REIT subsidiaries be structured to ensure that a taxable REIT subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation. As a result, there
are certain limits on the ability of a taxable REIT subsidiary to deduct interest payments made to the Company. In addition, the Company will be obligated to pay a 100% penalty tax on some payments that it receives or on certain expenses deducted by
the taxable REIT subsidiary if the economic arrangements between the REIT, the REIT’s tenants and the taxable REIT subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties.



On March 26,
2002, the Company formed a taxable REIT subsidiary, Ventas Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation. On November 8, 2002, the Company formed another taxable REIT subsidiary, Ventas TRS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Both companies
are owned 100% by Ventas Realty Limited Partnership. As of December 31, 2002, neither Ventas Capital Corporation nor Ventas TRS, LLC owns any assets of the Company.

Annual Distribution Requirements

In order to be taxed as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute dividends (other than capital gain
dividends) to its stockholders in an amount at least equal to (i) the sum of (A) 90% of the Company’s “REIT taxable income” (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and its net capital gain) and (B) 90% of the net
income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (ii) the sum of certain items of noncash income. Such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before the Company
timely files its tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. To the extent that the Company does not distribute all of its net capital gain or distributes at least 90%, but less than
100%, of its “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, it will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular capital gains and ordinary corporate tax rates except to the extent of net operating loss or capital loss carryforwards. If
any taxes are paid in connection with the Built-In Gain Rules, these taxes will be deductible in computing REIT taxable income. Furthermore, if the Company should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (i) 85% of its REIT
ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of its REIT capital gain net income for such year (other than long-term capital gain the Company elects to retain and treat as having been distributed to stockholders), and (iii) any undistributed taxable
income from prior periods, the Company will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts actually distributed.

The Company believes it has satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year of its REIT election
and each year thereafter. However, there can be no assurance that the Company has satisfied the distribution requirements for the year of its REIT election and subsequent years. Although the Company intends to continue meeting the annual
distribution requirements to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2003 and subsequent years, it is possible that economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may limit the Company’s ability
to meet such requirements. As a result, if it were not able to meet the annual distribution requirement, it would fail to qualify as a REIT.

Annual Record Keeping Requirements

In its first taxable year in which it qualifies as a REIT and thereafter, the Company is required to maintain certain records and request
on an annual basis certain information from its stockholders designed to disclose the actual ownership of its outstanding shares. The Company believes that it has complied with these requirements for all REIT tax years. The Company will be subject
to a penalty of $25,000 ($50,000 for intentional violations) for any year in which it does not comply with the rules.

Failure to Continue to Qualify

If the Company’s election to be taxed as a REIT is revoked or terminated (e.g., due to a failure to meet the REIT qualification
tests), the Company will be subject to tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate rates except to the extent of net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards. Distributions to stockholders
will not be deductible by the Company, nor will they be required to be made. To the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits, all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income, and, subject to certain limitations in
the Code, corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction. In addition, the Company would be prohibited from re-electing REIT status for the four taxable years following the year during which the Company ceased to qualify
as a REIT, unless certain relief provisions of the Code applied. It is impossible to predict whether the Company would be entitled to such statutory relief.



Taxation of U.S.
Stockholders

As used herein, the term
“U.S. Stockholder” means a holder of the Company’s Common Stock that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is (i) a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision thereof, (iii) an estate whose income from sources without the United States is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its connection
with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States or (iv) any trust with respect to which (A) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and (B) one or more U.S. persons have the
authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.

As long as the Company qualifies as a REIT, distributions made to the Company’s taxable U.S. Stockholders out of current or accumulated earnings and profits (and not designated as capital gain dividends) will be taken into
account by such U.S. Stockholders as ordinary income and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally available to corporations. Distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as a capital gain (to
the extent such distributions do not exceed the Company’s actual net capital gain for the taxable year) without regard to the period for which the stockholder has held its shares. The tax rates applicable to such capital gains are discussed
below. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a stockholder to the extent that they do not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder’s shares, but rather will reduce the adjusted basis
of such shares. To the extent that distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a stockholder’s shares, such distributions will be included in income as capital gains assuming the shares
are capital assets in the hands of the stockholder. The tax rate applicable to such capital gain will depend on the stockholder’s holding period for the shares. In addition, any distribution declared by the Company in October, November or
December of any year and payable to a stockholder of record on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by the Company and received by the stockholder on December 31 of such year, provided that the distribution is actually
paid by the Company during January of the following calendar year.

If the Company should become a closely held REIT, any person owning at least 10% (by vote or value) of the Company is required to accelerate the recognition of year-end dividends attributable to the Company, for purposes of
such person’s estimated tax payments. A closely held REIT is defined as one in which at least 50% (by vote or value) is owned by five or fewer persons. Attribution rules apply to determine ownership.

The Company may elect to treat all or a part of its
undistributed net capital gain as if it had been distributed to its stockholders (including for purposes of the 4% excise tax discussed above under “Requirements for Qualification—Annual Distribution Requirements”). If the Company
should make such an election, the Company’s stockholders would be required to include in their income as long-term capital gain their proportionate share of the Company’s undistributed net capital gain, as designated by the Company. Each
such stockholder would be deemed to have paid its proportionate share of the income tax imposed on the Company with respect to such undistributed net capital gain, and this amount would be credited or refunded to the stockholder. In addition, the
tax basis of the stockholder’s shares would be increased by its proportionate share of undistributed net capital gains included in its income, less its proportionate share of the income tax imposed on the Company with respect to such gains.

Stockholders may not include in their individual
income tax returns any net operating losses or capital losses of the Company. Instead, such losses would be carried over by the Company for potential offset against its future income (subject to certain limitations). Taxable distributions from the
Company and gain from the disposition of the Common Stock will not be treated as passive activity income and, therefore, stockholders generally will not be able to apply any “passive activity losses” (such as losses from certain types of
limited partnerships in which the stockholder is a limited partner) against such income. In addition, taxable distributions from the Company generally will be treated as investment income for purposes of the investment interest limitations. Capital
gains from the disposition of the shares (or distributions treated as such) will be treated as investment income only if



the stockholder so elects, in which case such capital gains will be taxed at ordinary income rates. The Company will notify stockholders
after the close of the Company’s taxable year as to the portions of the distributions attributable to that year that constitute ordinary income, return of capital and capital gain.

In general, any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of the Common Stock by a stockholder who is
not a dealer in securities will be treated as capital gain or loss. Lower marginal tax rates for individuals may apply in the case of capital gains, depending on the holding period of the shares that are sold. However, any loss upon a sale or
exchange of shares by a stockholder who has held such shares for six months or less (after applying certain holding period rules) will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of distributions from the Company required to be treated by
such stockholder as long-term capital gain. All or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares may be disallowed if other shares are purchased within 30 days before or after the disposition.

For non-corporate taxpayers, the tax rate differential between
capital gain and ordinary income may be significant. The highest marginal individual income tax rate applicable to ordinary income is 38.6% for 2002. Any capital gain generally will be taxed to a non-corporate taxpayer at a maximum rate of 20% with
respect to capital assets held for more than one year. The tax rates applicable to ordinary income apply to gain attributable to the sale or exchange of capital assets held for one year or less. In the case of capital gain attributable to the sale
or exchange of certain real property held for more than one year, an amount of such gain equal to the amount of all prior depreciation deductions not otherwise required to be taxed as ordinary depreciation recapture income will be taxed at a maximum
rate of 25%. With respect to distributions designated by a REIT as capital gain dividends (including deemed distributions of retained capital gains), the REIT also may designate (subject to certain limits) whether the dividend is taxable to
non-corporate stockholders as a 20% rate gain distribution or an unrecaptured depreciation distribution taxed at a 25% rate.

The characterization of income as capital or ordinary may affect the deductibility of capital losses. Capital losses not offset by capital
gains may be deducted against a non-corporate taxpayer’s ordinary income only up to a maximum annual amount of $3,000. Non-corporate taxpayers may carry forward their unused capital losses. All net capital gain of a corporate taxpayer is
subject to tax at ordinary corporate rates. A corporate taxpayer can deduct capital losses only to the extent of capital gains, with unused losses being carried back three years and forward five years.

Treatment of Tax-Exempt Stockholders

Tax-exempt organizations, including qualified employee
pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts (collectively, “Exempt Organizations”), generally are exempt from federal income taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable
income (UBTI). While many investments in real estate generate UBTI, the IRS has issued a published ruling that dividend distributions by a REIT to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares of the REIT are not
otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust. Based on that ruling, and subject to the exceptions discussed below, amounts distributed by the Company to Exempt Organizations generally should not constitute
UBTI. However, if an Exempt Organization finances its acquisition of the Common Stock with debt, a portion of its income from the Company will constitute UBTI pursuant to the “debt-financed property” rules. Furthermore, social clubs,
voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans that are exempt from taxation under paragraphs (7), (9), (17) and (20), respectively, of Section 501(c) of the Code are
subject to different UBTI rules, which generally will require them to characterize distributions from the Company as UBTI. In addition, in certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns more than 10% of the Company’s stock is required to
treat a percentage of the dividends from the Company as UBTI (the “UBTI Percentage”). The UBTI Percentage is the gross income, less related direct expenses, derived by the Company from an unrelated trade or business (determined as if the
Company were a pension trust) divided by the gross income, less related direct expenses, of the Company for the year in which the dividends are paid. The UBTI rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10% of



the Company’s stock only if (i) the UBTI Percentage is at least 5%, (ii) the Company qualifies as a REIT by reason of the modification
of the 5/50 Rule that allows the beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares of the Company in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and (iii) either (A) one pension trust owns more than 25% of the
value of the Company’s stock or (B) a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10% of the value of the Company’s stock collectively own more than 50% of the value of the Company’s stock.

Special Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Stockholders

The rules governing U.S. federal income taxation of
nonresident alien individuals, foreign corporations, foreign partnerships and other foreign stockholders (collectively, “Non-U.S. Stockholders”) are complex, and no attempt will be made herein to provide more than a summary of such rules.
Non-U.S. stockholders should consult with their own tax advisors to determine the impact of federal, state and local income tax laws with regard to their ownership of the Common Stock, including any reporting requirements.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S.
Stockholder” does not include any foreign stockholder whose investment in the Company’s stock is “effectively connected” with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Such a foreign stockholder, in general, will
be subject to United States federal income tax with respect to its investment in the Company’s stock in the same manner as a U.S. Stockholder is taxed (subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the
case of nonresident alien individuals). In addition, a foreign corporation receiving income that is treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business also may be subject to an additional 30% “branch profits tax,” unless an
applicable tax treaty provides a lower rate or an exemption. Certain certification requirements must be satisfied in order for effectively connected income to be exempt from withholding.

Distributions to Non-U.S. Stockholders that are not attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by the
Company of U.S. real property interests and are not designated by the Company as capital gain dividends (or deemed distributions of retained capital gains) will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of
current or accumulated earnings and profits of the Company. Such distributions ordinarily will be subject to a withholding tax equal to 30% of the gross amount of the distribution unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates that tax.
Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits of the Company will not be taxable to a stockholder to the extent that such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder’s shares, but rather will
reduce the adjusted basis of such shares. To the extent that distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a Non-U.S. Stockholder’s shares, such distributions will give rise to tax
liability if the Non-U.S. Stockholder would otherwise be subject to tax on any gain from the sale or disposition of its shares, as described below.

For any year in which the Company qualifies as a REIT, distributions that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by the Company
of U.S. real property interests will be taxed to a Non-U.S. Stockholder under the provisions of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”). Under FIRPTA, distributions attributable to gain from sales of U.S. real
property interests are taxed to a Non-U.S. Stockholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. business. Non-U.S. Stockholders thus would be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to U.S. Stockholders (subject to applicable
alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals). Distributions subject to FIRPTA also may be subject to 30% branch profits tax in the hands of a foreign corporate stockholder not entitled
to treaty relief or exemption.

Unless a reduced
rate of withholding applies under an applicable tax treaty, the Company generally will withhold from distributions to Non-U.S. Stockholders, and remit to the IRS, 30% of all distributions out of current or accumulated earnings and profits, subject
to the application of FIRPTA withholding rules discussed below. In addition, the Company is required to withhold 10% of any distribution in excess of its current and accumulated earnings and profits. Because the Company generally cannot determine at
the time a distribution is



made whether or not it will be in excess of earnings and profits, the Company intends to withhold 30% of the entire amount of any
distribution (other than distributions subject to the 35% withholding discussed below). Generally, however, a Non-U.S. Stockholder will be entitled to a refund from the IRS to the extent an amount is withheld from a distribution that exceeds the
amount of U.S. tax owed by such Non-U.S. Stockholder.

Under FIRPTA, the Company is required to withhold 35% of any distribution that is designated as a capital gain dividend or which could be designated as a capital gain dividend. Thus, if the Company designates previously made
distributions as capital gain dividends, subsequent distributions (up to the amount of such prior distributions) will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of FIRPTA withholding.

Under Regulations that are currently in effect, dividends paid
to an address in a country outside the United States generally are presumed to be paid to a resident of such country for purposes of determining the applicability of withholding discussed above and the applicability of a tax treaty rate. Regulations
issued in October 1997, however, provide that a Non-U.S. Stockholder who wishes to claim the benefit of an applicable treaty rate must satisfy certain certification and other requirements. Such Regulations generally will be effective for
distributions made after December 31, 2000.

For
so long as the Common Stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, the sale of such stock by any Non-U.S. Stockholder who is not a Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder (as defined below) generally will not be subject to
United States federal income tax (unless the Non-U.S. Stockholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions apply, in which case
such gain will be subject to a 30% tax on a gross basis). A “Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder” is a Non-U.S. Stockholder who, at some time during the five-year period preceding such sale or disposition, beneficially owned (including under
certain attribution rules) more than 5% of the total fair market value of the Common Stock (as outstanding from time to time) or owned shares of another class of stock of the Company that represented value greater than 5% of the Common Stock
(measured at the time such shares were acquired).

In general, the sale or other taxable disposition of the Common Stock by a Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder (as defined below) also will not be subject to United States federal income tax if the Company is a “domestically
controlled REIT.” A REIT is a “domestically controlled REIT” if, at all times during the five-year period preceding the relevant testing date, less than 50% in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by Non-U.S.
Stockholders (taking into account those persons required to include the Company’s dividends in income for United States federal income tax purposes). Although the Company believes that it currently qualifies as a “domestically controlled
REIT,” because the Common Stock is publicly traded, no assurance can be given that the Company will qualify as a domestically controlled REIT at any time in the future. If the Company does not constitute a domestically controlled REIT, a Five
Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder will be taxable in the same manner as a U.S. Stockholder with respect to gain on the sale of the Common Stock (subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of
nonresident alien individuals).

Information Reporting
Requirements and Backup Withholding Tax

The
Company will report to its U.S. Stockholders and to the IRS the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and distributions required to be treated as so paid during a calendar year, and the amount of tax withheld, if any. Under the
backup withholding rules, a stockholder may be subject to backup withholding at the applicable rate (30% beginning January 1, 2002) with respect to distributions paid unless such holder (i) is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt
categories and, when required, demonstrates this fact or (ii) provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup
withholding rules. A stockholder who does not provide the Company with its correct taxpayer identification number also may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS. In addition, the Company may be required to withhold a portion of capital gain
distributions to any stockholders who fail to certify their non-foreign status to the Company.



U.S.
Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualifications for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of any
backup withholding with respect to a payment to a U.S. Stockholder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Stockholder’s United States federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Stockholder to a refund, provided that the
required information is furnished to the IRS.

Backup withholding tax and information reporting generally will not apply to distributions paid to Non-U.S. Stockholders outside the United States that are treated as (i) dividends subject to the 30% (or lower treaty rate)
withholding tax discussed above, (ii) capital gain dividends or (iii) distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by the Company of U.S. real property interests. As a general matter, backup withholding and information reporting will
not apply to a payment of the proceeds of a sale of the Common Stock by or through a foreign office of a foreign broker. Information reporting (but not backup withholding) will apply, however, to a payment of the proceeds of a sale of the Common
Stock by a foreign office of a broker that (i) is a United States person, (ii) derives 50% or more of its gross income for certain periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or (iii) is a “controlled foreign
corporation” for United States tax purposes, unless the broker has documentary evidence in its records that the holder is a Non-U.S. Stockholder and certain other conditions are satisfied, or the stockholder otherwise establishes an exemption.
Payment to or through a United States office of a broker of the proceeds of a sale of the Common Stock is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the stockholder certifies under penalties of perjury that the stockholder
is a Non-U.S. Stockholder or otherwise establishes an exemption. A Non-U.S. Stockholder may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS.

The final Regulations issued by the Treasury Department in
1997, as corrected in 2000 and 2001 became effective January 1, 2001. In addition, the Treasury Department issued Temporary Regulations in January 2002, which together with the final Regulations govern the withholding of tax and information
reporting for certain amounts paid to non-resident alien individuals and foreign corporations. Stockholders should consult their tax advisors concerning the impact, if any, of these new Regulations on their ownership of shares of the Common Stock.

Other Tax Considerations

The Company and its stockholders may be subject to state and
local tax in states and localities in which they do business or own property. The tax treatment of the Company and the stockholders in such jurisdictions may differ from the federal income tax treatment described above. Consequently, stockholders
should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on their ownership of shares of the Common Stock.



RISK FACTORS

The Company’s business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks. This section
does not describe all risks applicable to the Company, its industry or its business, and it is intended only as a summary of certain material factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company could be materially and adversely
affected.

The Company has grouped these risk
factors into three general categories:

•

Risks arising from its business;

•

Risks arising from its capital structure; and

•

Risks arising from its status as a REIT.

Risks Arising from the Company’s Business

The Company is dependent on Kindred; Kindred’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with the
Company could significantly harm the Company and its ability to service its indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to its stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT.

The Company is dependent on Kindred in a number of ways:

•

The Company leases substantially all of its properties to Kindred under the Kindred Master Leases, and therefore:

•

Kindred is the primary source of the Company’s rental income, accounting for approximately 98.4% of the Company’s rental income in 2002; and

•

since the Kindred Master Leases are triple-net leases, it depends on Kindred to pay for insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses required in
connection with the leased properties.

•

In connection with the 1998 Spin Off, Kindred assumed, and agreed to indemnify the Company for, the following:

•

all obligations under third-party leases and third-party contracts, except for those contracts relating to the Company’s ownership of its properties;

•

all losses, including costs and expenses, resulting from future claims and all liabilities that may arise out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare
operations either before or after the date of the spin off; and

any claims that were pending at the time of the 1998 Spin Off and that arose out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations or were asserted after

The Company owns 920,814 shares of Kindred Common Stock.

Although Kindred emerged from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001, there can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and
access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with the Company. In addition, any failure by Kindred to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business
reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities. Any inability or unwillingness on the part of Kindred to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with the Company could have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. See “Business–Dependence on Kindred.”



The Company
may be unable to find another lessee or operator for its properties if it has to replace Kindred or its other operators.

The Company may have to find another lessee/operator for the properties covered by one or more of the Kindred Master Leases or its other
operators upon the expiration of the terms of the applicable lease or upon a default by Kindred or its other operators. During any period that the Company is attempting to locate one or more lessee/operators there could be a decrease or cessation of
rental payments by Kindred or its other operators. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to locate another suitable lessee/operator or, if the Company is successful in locating such an operator, that the rental payments from the
new operator would not be significantly less than the existing rental payments. The Company’s ability to locate another suitable lessee/operator and/or evict the existing operator or operators may be materially delayed or limited by various
state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules. Such delays and limitations could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and/or materially delay or impact the Company’s
ability to collect rent, to obtain possession of leased properties, or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant default. In addition, the Company may also incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any such licensing, receivership or
change-of-ownership proceedings.

The Company
may encounter certain risks when implementing its business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, healthcare-related and/or senior housing properties.

The Company intends to pursue investments in, and/or
acquisitions or development of, additional healthcare-related or other properties, subject to the contractual restrictions contained in the indentures (as defined under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Senior Notes Offering”) and the 2002 Credit Agreement. Acquisitions of and investments in such properties entail general investment risks associated with any real estate
investments, including risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations, the estimates of the cost of improvements necessary for acquired properties will prove inaccurate, and the inability of the lessee/operator to meet
performance expectations. The Company does not presently contemplate any development projects, although if it were to pursue new development projects, such projects would be subject to numerous risks, including risks of construction delays or cost
overruns that may increase project costs, new project commencement risks such as receipt of zoning, occupancy and other required governmental approvals and permits and the incurrence of development costs in connection with projects that are not
pursued to completion. In addition, the Company may borrow to finance any investments in, and/or acquisition or development of, healthcare-related or other properties, which would increase its leverage.

The Company may acquire independent living facilities,
specialty hospitals and other healthcare-related properties not currently in the Company’s portfolio and the Company has less experience evaluating and monitoring such properties.

The Company may compete for acquisition or investment opportunities with entities that have substantially
greater financial resources than it has. The Company’s ability to compete successfully for such opportunities is affected by many factors, including its cost of obtaining debt and equity capital at rates comparable to or better than its
competitors. Competition generally may reduce the number of suitable acquisition or investment opportunities available to the Company and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding its acquisitions, investment
or development activities. See “Business—Competition.”

Even if the Company is successful at identifying and competing for acquisition or investment opportunities, such opportunities involve a number of risks, including diversion of management’s attention, the risk that the
value of the properties the Company acquires or invests in could decrease substantially after such acquisition or investment and the risk that the Company will not be able to accurately assess the value of properties that are not of the type it
currently owns, some or all of which could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Additionally, if the Company is successful in implementing its business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, healthcare-related and/or senior housing properties,
the Company may



have numerous operators of its properties. Historically, substantially all of the Company’s properties have been operated by a single
operator, Kindred. There can be no assurance that the Company would have the capabilities to successfully monitor and manage a portfolio of properties with multiple operators.

The Company is subject to the risks associated with investment in a single industry: the heavily regulated
healthcare industry.

All of the
Company’s investments are in properties used in the healthcare industry; therefore the Company is exposed to risks associated with the healthcare industry in particular. The healthcare industry is highly regulated and changes in government
regulation have in the past had material adverse consequences on the industry in general, which may not even have been contemplated by lawmakers and regulators. There can be no assurance that future changes in government regulation of healthcare
will not have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry, including its lessees. Moreover, the Company’s ability to invest in non-healthcare non-senior housing related properties is restricted by the terms of the 2002 Credit
Agreement. See “Governmental Regulation—Healthcare Regulation.”

The Company’s tenants, including Kindred, may be adversely affected by increasing healthcare regulation and enforcement.

The Company believes that the regulatory environment surrounding the long-term care industry has intensified
both in the amount and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. This is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like Kindred.

The extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include, but
are not limited to, laws and regulations relating to licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or
abusive behavior, and financial and other arrangements which may be entered into by healthcare providers. Federal and state governments have intensified enforcement policies, resulting in a significant increase in the number of inspections,
citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, bars on Medicare and Medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. See
“Governmental Regulation—Healthcare Regulation.” If Kindred and the Company’s other tenants and operators fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses, they could
become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, suffer civil and/or criminal penalties and/or be required to make significant changes to their operations. Kindred and the Company’s other
tenants also could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. In addition, as part of the settlement agreement Kindred entered into with the federal
government, it agreed to comply with the terms of a corporate integrity agreement. Kindred could incur additional expenses in complying with the corporate integrity agreement, and its failure to comply with the corporate integrity agreement could
have a material adverse effect on Kindred’s results of operations, financial condition and its ability to make rental payments to the Company, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

The Company is unable to predict the future course of federal,
state and local regulation or legislation, including the Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations. Changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on Kindred and the Company’s other operators, which, in turn,
could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s tenants.

Kindred and the Company’s other tenants and operators
rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. See “Governmental



Regulation—Healthcare Regulation.” There continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement
cost-containment measures that limit payments to healthcare providers. In addition, private third-party payors have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available
for services to be provided by Kindred and other tenants which are currently being reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed and on
reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of Kindred and the Company’s other operators and other tenants, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

There also continues to
be state legislative proposals that would impose more limitations on government and private payments to providers of healthcare services such as Kindred. Many states have enacted or are considering enacting measures that are designed to reduce their
Medicaid expenditures and to make certain changes to private healthcare insurance. Some states also are considering regulatory changes that include a moratorium on the designation of additional LTACs. There are a number of legislative proposals
currently under consideration, including cost caps and the establishment of Medicaid prospective payment systems for nursing centers.

There continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost-containment measures that limit
payments to healthcare providers. In addition, private third-party payors have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services to be provided by Kindred
and other tenants which are currently being reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a
material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of Kindred and the Company’s other operators and other tenants, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect. See “Governmental
Regulation—Healthcare Regulation.”

Significant legal actions, particularly in the State of Florida, could subject Kindred and the Company’s other operators to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially and adversely
affect Kindred’s and the Company’s other operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operation.

Kindred and the Company’s other operators have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care
liability claims in recent years. In addition to large compensatory claims, plaintiffs’ attorneys increasingly are seeking significant punitive damages and attorneys’ fees. In the State of Florida, where Kindred operates 15 of the
Company’s skilled nursing facilities and six of the Company’s hospitals, general liability and professional liability costs for nursing centers have increased substantially and become increasingly difficult to estimate. Kindred has
announced its intention to withdraw from the Florida SNF market and to sublease its interests to a third party. The Company and Kindred are currently not in agreement as to the terms, if any, on which Kindred may undertake such a sublease. See
“Business—Recent Developments—Kindred’s Increased Professional Liability Expense in Florida.”

Due to the increase in the number and severity of professional liability claims against healthcare providers, the availability of
professional liability insurance has been severely restricted and the premiums on such insurance coverage have increased dramatically. As a result, Kindred’s and the Company’s other operators’ insurance coverage might not cover all
claims against them or continue to be available to them at a reasonable cost. If Kindred or the Company’s other operators are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, they may be exposed to
substantial liabilities.

Kindred insures its
professional liability risks in part through a wholly-owned, limited purpose insurance company. The limited purpose insurance company insures initial losses up to specified coverage levels per



occurrence with no aggregate coverage limit. Coverage for losses in excess of those per occurrence levels is maintained through unaffiliated
commercial insurance carriers up to an aggregate limit. The limited purpose insurance company then insures all claims in excess of the aggregate limit for the unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers. Kindred maintains general liability insurance
and professional malpractice liability insurance in amounts and with deductibles which Kindred management has indicated that it believes are sufficient for its operations.

Operators that insure their professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities
generally estimate the future cost of professional liability through actuarial studies which rely primarily on historical data. However, due to the increase in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these
actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims and there can be no assurance that such operators’ reserves for future claims will be adequate to cover the actual cost of such claims. If the actual cost of such claims are
significantly higher than the operators’ reserves, it could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operation of the operator and their ability to make rental payments to the Company, which in turn,
could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

A downgrade of the Company’s credit ratings may have a material adverse effect.

The Company has a Ba3 senior debt rating from Moody’s Investors Service and a BB- corporate credit rating from Standard &
Poor’s Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. In October 2002, Moody’s placed the Company’s credit ratings, including those of Ventas Realty and its other rated subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade.
Factors that may influence a rating agency’s determination of its credit rating include, but are not limited to, the Company’s success in raising sufficient equity capital, its capital structure, its level of indebtedness and pending or
future changes in the regulatory framework applicable to its tenants or its industry. Any downgrade of the Company’s credit ratings could make it more difficult or more expensive for the Company to incur additional indebtedness and adversely
affect the value of its common stock. There can be no assurance that the Company’s credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future.

Kindred and the Company’s other operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute.

Kindred and the Company’s other operators may be sued
under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. See “Government Regulation—Healthcare Regulation.” These lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to
private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. If any such lawsuits were to be brought against Kindred and the Company’s other operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could
have a Material Adverse Effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operation of Kindred and the Company’s other operators and their ability to make rental payments to the Company, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse
Effect.

If any of the Company’s
properties are found to be contaminated, or if the Company becomes involved in any environmental disputes, the Company could incur substantial liabilities and costs.

Under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be
liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. Owners of real property
may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Environmental laws and regulations often impose liability
without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. In certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current
or former operator of the property. While the Company is generally indemnified by the current operators of the Company’s properties for contamination caused by such operators, such indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs.
“Government Regulation—Environmental Regulation.”



Risks Arising from the
Company’s Capital Structure

The
Company is highly leveraged.

As of December
31, 2002, the Company had approximately $707.7 million of indebtedness, approximately an additional $44.0 million of obligations under the United States Settlement, and approximately $185.3 million in additional borrowings available under the
Company’s credit facility. The Indentures permit the Company to incur substantial additional debt, and the Company may borrow additional funds, which may include secured borrowings. A high level of indebtedness may have the following
consequences:

•

the requirement that a substantial portion of the Company’s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of debt service, thus reducing the funds
available for the Company’s business strategy and for distributions to stockholders;

•

potential limits on the Company’s ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic
conditions or in the real estate and/or healthcare sectors;

•

a potential impairment of the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing for the its business strategy; and

•

a downgrade in the rating of the Company’s debt securities by one or more rating agencies which could have the effect of, among other things, increasing the
cost of its borrowing.

The
Company may be unable to raise additional capital necessary to implement its business plan and to meet the Company’s debt payments and obligations under the United States Settlement.

In order to implement the Company’s business plan and to
meet its debt payments and obligations under the United States Settlement, the Company may need to raise additional capital. The Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness is restricted by the terms of the Indentures and the 2002 Credit
Agreement. In addition, adverse economic conditions could cause the terms on which the Company can obtain additional borrowings to become unfavorable. In such circumstances, the Company may be required to raise additional equity in the capital
markets or liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on the investments and that could result in adverse tax consequences to the Company. In addition, certain healthcare
regulations may constrain the Company’s ability to sell assets. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to meet its debt service obligations or its obligations under the United States Settlement and the failure to do so could
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

The Company hedges floating-rate debt with interest rate swaps and may record charges associated with the termination or change in value of these interest-swaps.

The Company has interest rate swaps that hedge interest payment obligations on floating-rate debt. The
Company periodically assess its interest rate swaps in relation to its outstanding balances of floating-rate debt, and based on such assessments may terminate portions of its swaps or enter into additional swaps. Termination of swaps with accrued
losses, or changes in the value of swaps as a result of falling interest rates, would result in changes to the Company’s earnings and net worth, which could be significant.

Risks Arising from the Company’s Status as a REIT

Loss of the Company’s status as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to the Company and
the value of its common stock.

If the
Company loses its status as a REIT, it will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to its stockholders for each of the years involved because:

•

the Company would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing its taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular
corporate rates;



•

the Company also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and

•

unless the Company is entitled to relief under statutory provisions, it could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year
during which it was disqualified.

In addition, if the Company fails to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders would be subject to tax as ordinary income (but corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction) to the extent of
its current and accumulated earnings and profits, and the Company will not be required to make distributions to stockholders.

As a result of all these factors, the Company’s failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair its ability to implement its business
strategy and would adversely affect the value of the Company’s common stock.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of
various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the Company’s control may affect its ability to remain qualified as a REIT. In addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely
affect the Company’s investors or its ability to remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes. Although the Company believes that it qualifies as a REIT, there can be no assurance that it will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT
for tax purposes.

See “Federal Income Tax
Considerations—Federal Income Taxation of the Company” and “—Requirements for Qualification.”

The 90% distribution requirement will decrease the Company’s liquidity and may limit its ability to engage in otherwise beneficial
transactions.

To comply with the 90%
distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, the Company must make distributions to its stockholders. See “Federal Income Tax Considerations—Federal Income Taxation of the
Company—Requirements for Qualification as a REIT—Distribution Requirements for REIT Qualification.” The terms of the Indentures permit the Company to make annual distributions to its stockholders in an amount equal to the minimum
amount necessary to maintain its REIT status so long as its ratio of Debt to Adjusted Total Assets (as defined in the Indentures) does not exceed 60% and to make additional distributions if the Company passes certain other financial tests.

Although the Company anticipates that it
generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable it to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that from time to time the Company may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution
requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. This may be due to the timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and
the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at its taxable income. In addition, nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may also cause
the Company to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable it to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement.

These distributions may limit the Company’s ability to rely upon rental payments from its properties or subsequently acquired
properties to finance investments, acquisitions or new developments.

In the event that timing differences or other cash needs occur, the Company may find it necessary to borrow funds, issue additional equity securities (although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so), pay
taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities (including Kindred Common Stock) or



engage in a transaction intended to enable the Company to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require the Company to raise
additional capital to meet its obligations; however, see “Risk Factors—Risks Arising from the Company’s Capital Structure—the Company may be unable to raise additional capital necessary to implement its business plan and to meet
its debt payments and its obligations under the United States Settlement.” The terms of the Indentures and the 2002 Credit Agreement restrict the Company’s ability to engage in some of these transactions.

The Company may still be subject to corporate level taxes.

Following the Company’s REIT election,
the Company is considered to be a former C corporation for income tax purposes. Therefore, potentially, the Company remains subject to corporate level taxes for any asset dispositions occurring between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2008. The IRS
is currently reviewing the Company’s federal tax returns for tax years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998 and may also review its federal tax returns for subsequent years. On January 16, 2003, the Company agreed to a revised IRS Revenue
Agent’s report quantifying the examination findings in connection with the 1997 and 1998 income tax periods. This report concluded that, pending final review by the Joint Committee of Taxation, the Company does not owe any additional taxes, and
is entitled to an additional refund of $1.2 million, for the period in question. If received, this $1.2 million would be deposited into a joint tax escrow account between the Company and Kindred. The revised report is under review by the Joint
Committee of Taxation. Until the review of the Joint Committee of Taxation is final, however, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these matters or whether that outcome will have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

If there are any resulting tax liabilities for
the tax years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, the Company intends to use the net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards, if any (including the NOL carryforwards that were utilized to offset its federal income tax liability for 1999 and
2000), to satisfy those tax liabilities. If the tax liabilities exceed the amount of NOL carryforwards, then the Company will use the escrowed amounts under the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement with Kindred (“Tax Refund Escrow Agreement”) to
satisfy the remaining tax liabilities. As of December 31, 2002, $29 million was escrowed under the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement. To the extent that NOL carryforwards and escrowed amounts are not sufficient to satisfy the tax liabilities, Kindred has
indemnified the Company for specific tax liabilities and Kindred has assumed these obligations. There can be no assurance that the NOL carryforwards and the escrowed amounts will be sufficient to satisfy these liabilities, that Kindred has any
obligation to indemnify the Company for particular tax liabilities, that Kindred will have sufficient financial means to enable it to satisfy its indemnity obligations under the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement or that Kindred will continue to honor its
indemnification obligations.

The Company may
jeopardize its REIT status if it violates the 10% securities test or the 5% asset test because of the value of the Kindred common stock.

The Company leases substantially all of its properties to Kindred and Kindred is the primary source of the Company’s rental income.
Under Kindred’s plan of reorganization, the Company received 1,498,500 shares of Kindred common stock on April 20, 2001 as future rent. As of December 31, 2002 the Company owned 920,814 shares of Kindred Common Stock. If the Company violated or
violates the 10% securities test described under the heading “Business—Federal Income Taxation Considerations,” Kindred would be a related party tenant and consequently, the rents from Kindred would not qualify as “rents from
real property” under the tax code. As a result, the Company would lose its REIT status because it likely would not be able to satisfy either the 75% or the 95% gross income test also described under the heading “Business—Federal
Income Taxation Considerations.”

In
addition, if the Company’s shares of Kindred common stock exceed 10% of the voting power or value of Kindred’s outstanding stock or if the value of its shares of Kindred common stock exceeds 5% of the value of its total assets at the end
of the quarter in which the Company received the Kindred Common Stock or at the end of any subsequent quarter (except where such excess in subsequent quarters is caused by value fluctuations of the



Company’s various investments and not by the acquisition or disposition of assets), the Company would violate the 10% securities test or
the 5% asset test. Consequently, the Company would lose its REIT status unless it cured the violation in a timely manner under the applicable provisions of the Code. There can be no assurance that relief for such a violation would be available. See
“Business—Federal Income Taxation Considerations.”

President Bush’s proposed tax cut could adversely affect the price of the Company’s common stock.

President Bush has proposed a tax reduction package that would, among other things, reduce the double taxation of non-REIT corporate
dividends. If the double taxation of corporate dividends were to be eliminated or reduced, certain of the relative tax advantages of being a REIT would be eliminated or reduced, which may have an adverse affect on the price of the Company’s
common stock. This adverse affect may take place prior to the adoption of any tax cut based on the market’s perception of the likelihood of implementation of such a provision.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

The Company believes that it has a diversified portfolio of healthcare facilities in terms of geography and the healthcare services provided at such facilities. The Company believes that the geographic diversity of the
properties makes the portfolio less susceptible to adverse changes in state regulation and regional economic downturns. The long-term acute care hospitals owned or ground leased by the Company primarily provide long-term acute care to medically
complex, chronically ill patients, covering approximately 3,894 beds in 43 hospitals as of December 31, 2002. The Company’s one 29 bed rehabilitation hospital provides high intensity physical, respiratory, neurological, orthopedic and other
treatment protocols for patients during recovery. The nursing facilities owned or ground leased by the Company are leading providers of rehabilitation services, including physical, occupational and speech therapies, and care for patients with
Alzheimer’s disease, covering approximately 27,840 beds in 220 nursing facilities as of December 31, 2002. The other nine facilities owned by the Company include eight personal care facilities and one assisted living facility which provide
services including assisted living, neurorehabilitation, neurobehavioral management and vocational programs, covering approximately 181 beds as of December 31, 2002.

The Company leases its corporate offices in Louisville, Kentucky and Chicago, Illinois.

The following table sets forth information for each of the
Kindred Master Leases and the facilities leased thereunder. The chart also includes under the heading “Other Facilities” those properties under leases with non-Kindred lessees. Ventas Realty has granted mortgage liens on certain of its
properties to secure borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement. Ventas Finance granted mortgage liens on all of the properties covered by the Kindred CMBS Master Lease as security for the indebtedness under the CMBS Loan Agreement.

the first, second and third



quarters of the year ended December 31, 2001. A quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share and a special dividend of $0.04 per share were paid in
the first quarter of 2002 for the 2001 tax year through a distribution of approximately $824,000 in cash and 334,886 shares of Kindred Common Stock.

As previously announced, we expect to pay total dividends to our stockholders for 2003 at the annual rate of $1.07 per share, consistent
with our intention to distribute 100% or more of our taxable net income to its stockholders (the “Distribution Policy”). In accordance with the Distribution Policy, the Company declared the first quarterly dividend for 2003 of $0.2675 per
share on February 21, 2003, which dividend will be paid in cash on March 17, 2003 to stockholders of record on March 4, 2003. The Company expects that dividends for 2003 will continue to be paid quarterly, in cash, although the Company could choose
to pay dividends by distributing a combination of cash and other property or securities, including the Kindred Common Stock.

A number of factors are considered by the Company’s Board of Directors when making the final determination regarding the frequency
and amount of the Company’s dividends. These decisions regarding dividends are normally made at least quarterly. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will maintain this Distribution Policy. Please refer to the Cautionary
Statements and Risk Factors contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of other factors that may affect its Distribution Policy.

The following selected financial data with respect to the Company should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements which are included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.




The Company considers funds from operation (“FFO”) an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT and the Company uses the National Association of
Real Estate Investment Trusts’ (“NAREIT”) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Sates (“GAAP”)), excluding gains (or losses)
from sales of real estate property, plus depreciation for real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate
companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company’s financial performance or as
an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company’s liquidity, nor is FFO indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs.


Normalized FFO excludes the gain on sale of Kindred Common Stock and the net loss on the swap breakage as follows for the years ended December 31,:

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company’s consolidated results of operations and
financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), which requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and the related disclosures. The Company believes that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically evaluates its
long-lived assets, primarily consisting of its investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future
undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. The Company adjusts the net book value of leased properties and other long-lived assets to fair value, if the sum of the expected future cash flow or sales proceeds is less than book value.
Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.

Legal Contingencies

The Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. The Consolidated Financial Statements do not reflect any reserves with
respect to such legal proceedings.



As described
further in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation and other matters arose from the Company’s operations prior to the time of the Company’s spin-off of Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries,
“Kindred”) on May 1, 1998 (the “1998 Spin Off”) or relate to assets or liabilities transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off. Under the agreements entered into by the Company and Kindred at the time of the 1998
Spin Off, as such agreements may have been amended and restated in connection with Kindred’s emergence from bankruptcy (the “1998 Spin Agreements”), Kindred agreed to assume the defense, on behalf of the Company, of certain defined
claims. Kindred is presently defending the Company in these matters as required under the 1998 Spin Agreements, however, there can be no assurance that Kindred will continue to defend the Company in such matters or that Kindred will have sufficient
assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy such obligations. A change in Kindred’s ability to perform under these commitments could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operation
and liquidity of the Company and on the Company’s ability to service its indebtedness and its obligations under the United States Settlement and on the Company’s ability to make distributions to its stockholders as required to continue to
qualify as a REIT (a “Material Adverse Effect”).

The Company is also involved in other litigation as further described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is the opinion of management that the disposition of such matters will not have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. If management’s assessment of the Company’s liability with respect to these actions in incorrect, such matters could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Income Taxes

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is currently
reviewing the federal income tax returns of the Company for tax years ending December 31, 1997 and 1998. The IRS may challenge the Company’s entitlement to capital loss and net operating loss carryforwards (“NOL Carryforwards”). To
the extent such NOL Carryforwards and escrow amounts under a tax refund escrow agreement (“Tax Refund Escrow Agreement”) between the Company and Kindred are not sufficient to satisfy such liabilities, if any, Kindred has indemnified the
Company for certain, but not all of the tax liabilities under a tax allocation agreement between the Company and Kindred (the “Tax Allocation Agreement”). There can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of these matters with the IRS
or whether such outcome will have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Additionally, there can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its indemnity obligations under the
Tax Allocation Agreement.

On January 16, 2003,
the Company agreed to a revised IRS Revenue Agent’s report quantifying the examination findings in connection with the 1997 and 1998 income tax periods. This report concluded that, pending final review by the Joint Committee of Taxation, the
Company does not owe any additional taxes, and is entitled to an additional refund of $1.2 million, for the period in question. If received, this $1.2 million would be deposited into a joint tax escrow account between Ventas and Kindred. The revised
report is under review by the Joint Committee of Taxation. Until the review of the Joint Committee of Taxation is final, however, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these matters or whether such outcome will have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

During the year
ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded a provision for taxes on the 10% of its estimated 2001 taxable income that the Company did not distribute. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company filed its 2001 federal tax return on which it elected
to apply certain 2002 dividend payments in excess of its 2002 taxable net income against such 2001 undistributed taxable net income. As a result, the Company recorded a $2.2 million tax benefit in the quarter ended September 30, 2002.

A provision for income tax for the 2002 tax year
was not recorded in the year ended December 31, 2002 due to the Company’s ability and intention to distribute to its stockholders at least 100% of its estimated 2002 taxable income.



Fair Value
of Derivative Instruments

The valuation of
derivative instruments under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair value for the Company’s
derivatives are obtained from a third party consultant which utilizes pricing models that consider forward yield curves and discount rates. Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the Company are
subject to significant estimates which may change in the future.

Results of Operations

The Company elected to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended December 31, 1999. Beginning with the tax year 1999, the Company believes that it has satisfied the requirements to continue to
qualify as a REIT. The Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2003 and subsequent years. It is possible that economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause the
Company to fail, or elect not, to continue to qualify as a REIT. If the Company were to fail, or elect not, to continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company would be subject to 35% federal income tax and to the applicable state and local income taxes
for the affected years. Such tax obligations could have a Material Adverse Effect. Unless eligible for limited relief, if the Company failed, or revoked its election, to qualify as a REIT, the Company would not be eligible to elect again to be
treated as a REIT before the fifth year after the year of such termination or revocation.

Effective January 1, 2002 the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (“SFAS 144”), “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets.” SFAS 144 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS 144 extends the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include components of an entity that
have either been disposed or are classified as held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company disposed of a 125 licensed bed skilled nursing facility located in Las Vegas, Nevada and a 164 licensed bed hospital facility located
in Arlington, Virginia. The operating results of these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for each of the three years ended December 31, 2002 included herein. See “Note
5—Dispositions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001

Rental income for year ended December 31, 2002 was $189.5 million, of which $186.5 million (98.4%) resulted from leases with Kindred. The rental income from Kindred includes $2.5 million related to the
amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of the Company’s receipt of common stock in Kindred (the “Kindred Common Stock”) and the $4.5 million of additional future rent under the five master lease agreements (the
“Kindred Master Leases”) with Kindred. The rental income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $183.3 million, of which $181.0 million (98.7%) resulted from leases with Kindred. The $6.2 million increase in rental income consists
primarily of (a) the 3.5% increase in the rent paid under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2002 and (b) additional rent received under the master lease (the “THI Master Lease”) with Trans Healthcare, Inc. (“THI”)
entered into by the Company and THI properties on November 4, 2002. The Company reported two months of interest income from a mezzanine loan and senior loan of $1.0 million. The senior loan was sold in December 2002. Annualized interest on the
mezzanine loan is expected to be approximately $3 million. See “Note 6—Other Acquisitions and Dispositions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest and other income totaled approximately $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared
to approximately $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in interest income was primarily the result of lower cash balances and reduced interest rates.



Expenses
totaled $146.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and included $42.0 million of depreciation expense and $78.4 million of interest on debt financing (inclusive of swap ineffectiveness) and $5.5 million of interest on the United States
Settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2001, expenses totaled $149.2 million and included $41.8 million of depreciation expense on real estate assets, $86.2 million of interest on the Company’s prior credit agreement (the “2000 Credit
Agreement”) and other debt and $4.6 million of interest on the United States Settlement. The $3.2 million decrease consists primarily of (a) a $7.8 million decrease in interest expense, and (b) a $2.0 million decrease in general and
administrative expenses and professional fees, which were offset by (x) an additional expense of $5.4 million related to the loss on a $350 million notional swap breakage (see “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated
Financial Statements), (y) a $0.9 million increase in interest on the United States Settlement which was entered into on April 20, 2001, and (z) a $0.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization.

Interest expense excluding the interest on the United States
Settlement decreased $7.8 million to $78.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $86.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. $3.1 million of the decrease is primarily a result of reduced principal balances and $7.2
million relates to reduced interest rates resulting from the CMBS Transaction in December 2001, and the April 2002 closing of the 2002 Credit Agreement (as defined below) and the Senior Notes Offering (as defined below). $0.6 million of the decrease
is included in discontinued operations. The decrease is offset by a $1.9 million “swap ineffectiveness” expense recognized in the Statement of Operations to reflect the value of the excess of the notional amount of the 1998 Swap and
2003-2008 Swap over the Company’s anticipated variable rate debt balance in the future. See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Professional fees totaled approximately $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to
$4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease relates primarily to the reduction in professional fees incurred as a result of the Company’s stabilized operations in 2002.

During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded
a provision for taxes on the 10% of its estimated 2001 taxable income that the Company did not distribute. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company filed its 2001 federal income tax return on which it elected to apply certain 2002 dividend payments
in excess of its 2002 estimated taxable net income against such 2001 undistributed taxable net income. As a result, the Company recorded a $2.2 million tax benefit in the third quarter ended September 30, 2002.

In connection with the refinancing of its indebtedness under
the 2000 Credit Agreement, the Company incurred an extraordinary loss of $6.9 million related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the 2000 Credit Agreement. In December 2002, the Company incurred an additional
$4.2 extraordinary loss related to the repurchase of $34.0 million in Senior Notes consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums paid to repurchase. In connection with the refinancing of a portion of its
indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement, the Company incurred an extraordinary loss of approximately $1.3 million related to the partial write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the 2000 Credit Agreement. See “Note
7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company disposed of a total of 159,500 shares of Kindred Common Stock for an average net price of $43.39 per share and recognized a gain of $5.0 million.
The Company applied net proceeds of $7.0 million as a prepayment of the Company’s indebtedness under the 2002 Credit Agreement. As a result of Kindred’s announcement relating to the Florida skilled nursing facilities and other events, the
market value of the Company’s Kindred Common Stock declined substantially in the fourth quarter of 2002. As of December 31, 2002, the Company owned 920,814 shares of Kindred Common Stock with a market value of $16.7 million, or $18.15 per
share. The Company disposed of 418,186 shares of Kindred Common Stock in the fourth quarter of 2001 and recognized a gain of $15.4 million on the dispositions.

On March 13, 2002, the Company sold a 125 licensed bed skilled nursing facility located in Las Vegas, Nevada to an unrelated third party
for $1.8 million and recognized a gain of $1.1 million which was reported as a



component of Discontinued Operations. The Company applied net proceeds of $1.5 million as a prepayment of the Company’s indebtedness
under the 2000 Credit Agreement. On June 21, 2002, the Company sold a 164 licensed bed hospital facility located in Arlington, Virginia to an unrelated third party and recognized a gain of approximately $22.4 million which was reported as a
component of Discontinued Operations. The Company applied net proceeds of $27.1 million as a prepayment of the Company’s indebtedness under the 2002 Credit Agreement.

After income from discontinued operations of $23.8 million, or $0.34 per diluted share and an extraordinary
loss of $11.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $65.7 million or $0.93 per diluted share. Net income for year ended December 31, 2001 was $50.6 million or $0.73 per diluted share after
discontinued operations of $0.7 million (or $.01 per share) and an extraordinary loss of $1.3 million (or $0.02 per share).

Years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000

Net of total write-offs, rental revenue increased $2.1 million in 2001 compared to 2000. Rental income for
the year ended December 31, 2001 was $183.3 million, of which $181.0 million (98.7%) resulted from leases with Kindred. The rental income from Kindred includes $1.7 million related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of
Ventas Realty’ Limited Partnership’s (“Ventas Realty”) receipt of the Kindred Common Stock and the $4.5 million of additional future rent under the Kindred Master Leases. Net rental income for the year ended December 31, 2000 was
$181.2 million, of which $178.4 million (98.5%) resulted from the Leases with Kindred. In 2000, the outcome of the Kindred bankruptcy was uncertain, and the difference between the rent provided for in the prior Kindred master leases and rent
actually received from Kindred was written off to uncollectible amounts due from tenants. Kindred’s plan of reorganization (the “Kindred Reorganization Plan”) under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code terminated the Company’s
right to the payment of the difference between rent required to be paid under the terms of the prior Kindred master leases and the rent received by the Company after the date that Kindred filed for protection under chapter 11 of title 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code and prior to the beginning of the month immediately following the effective date of the Kindred Plan of Reorganization (the “Kindred Effective Date”). As a result, for the period from January 1, 2001 through April 30,
2001, the Company recorded revenue equal to the amount actually paid by Kindred under a stipulation entered into with Kindred at the commencement of its bankruptcy case. The Company included in its revenue computation for the period of May 1, 2001
through December 31, 2001 the amount of rent due and payable under the Kindred master leases for that period.

Interest and other income totaled approximately $4.0 million and $9.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The decrease in interest was primarily the result of lower cash balances during the year as well as reduced market interest rates.

Expenses totaled $149.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and included $41.8 million of depreciation expense, $86.2
million of interest on the 2000 Credit Agreement and other debt and $4.6 million interest on the United States Settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2000 expenses totaled $301.5 million and included $42.0 million of depreciation
expense on real estate assets and $93.6 million of interest on the 2000 Credit Agreement and other debt. The $152.3 million decrease in expenses in 2001 was due primarily to (a) a charge in 2000 of $96.5 million related to the United States
Settlement, (b) a charge to earnings in 2000 of $47.4 million for unpaid rent from tenants, which primarily includes the difference between the minimum monthly base rent that would have been due under the terms of the prior Kindred master
leases and the base rent that was paid under the terms of the rent stipulation entered into in connection with the Kindred bankruptcy, (c) decreased interest expense and (d) decreased professional fees.

In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a $96.5
million charge related to the United States Settlement. Under the United States Settlement, the Company will pay $103.6 million to the federal government, of which $34.0 million was paid on the Kindred Effective Date. The balance of $69.6 million
bears interest at 6%



per annum and is payable in equal quarterly installments over a five-year term commencing on June 30, 2001. The charge for the United States
Settlement was discounted for accounting purposes based on an imputed borrowing rate of 10.75%.

Professional fees totaled approximately $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease relates primarily to the
reduction in professional fees incurred as a result of Kindred’s emergence from bankruptcy. See “Note 4—Concentration of Credit Risk” and “Note 11—Transactions with Kindred” to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Interest expense, excluding the
interest on the United States Settlement, decreased $7.4 million to $86.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $93.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease is primarily a result of reduced principal,
reduced amortization of deferred financing fees and the favorable impact in the first quarter of 2001 of timing differences in the rate setting under the Company’s interest rate swap agreement and the 2000 Credit Agreement. See “Note
7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2000, interest expense includes a $13.8 million payment on the 1998 Swap Agreement (as defined below). For the year ended
December 31, 2000, the Company received payments totaling $4.3 million related to the 1998 Swap, which offset interest expense.

The IRS is currently reviewing the federal income tax returns of the Company for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998. On
January 16, 2003, the Company agreed to a revised IRS Revenue Agent’s report quantifying the examination findings in connection with the 1997 and 1998 income tax periods. This report concludes that, pending final review by the Joint Committee
of Taxation, the Company does not owe any additional taxes, and is entitled to an additional refund of $1.2 million, for the period in question. If received, this $1.2 million would be deposited into a joint tax escrow account between
Ventas and Kindred. Until the review of the Joint Committee of Taxation is final, however, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these matters or whether such outcome will have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

However, if there are any resulting tax
liabilities, if any, for the tax years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998 will be satisfied first from the use of Net Operating Loss (“NOL”) carryforwards (including the NOL carryforwards that were utilized to offset the Company’s
federal income tax liability for 1999 and 2000) to satisfy those liabilities.

As a result of the uncertainties relating to the Company’s ability to retain its NOL carry forwards, the Company recorded a charge for taxes on the 10% of its estimated 2001 taxable income which
the Company did not distribute as a dividend. The $2.7 million tax provision reported for the year ended December 31, 2001 included a $0.7 million provision related to Ventas Realty’s receipt of the Kindred Common Stock, of which 100% was
taxable income to the Company in the second quarter of 2001. See “Note 10—Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company disposed of 418,186 shares of Kindred Common Stock in the fourth quarter of 2001 and recognized a gain of $15.4 million on the
dispositions. In connection with a registered offering of common stock by Kindred, Ventas Realty exercised its piggyback registration rights, and sold 83,300 shares of Kindred Common Stock, recognizing a gain of $2.6 million. The Company applied the
net proceeds of $3.6 million from the sale of the 83,300 shares of Kindred Common Stock as a prepayment on the Company’s indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement. The Company distributed 334,886 shares of Kindred Common Stock as part of the
2001 dividend, resulting in a gain of $12.8 million. For every share of common stock of the Company that a stockholder owned at the close of business on December 14, 2001, the stockholder received 0.005 of a share of Kindred Common Stock and $0.0049
in cash (equating to one share of Kindred Common Stock and $0.98 in cash for every two hundred shares of common stock in the Company). For purposes of the 2001 dividend, the Kindred Common Stock was valued in accordance with the Code and applicable
rulings and regulations on December 31, 2001 at $51.02 per share (the average of the high and low price on that day).



In connection
with the refinancing of a portion of its indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement, in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company incurred an extraordinary loss of approximately $1.3 million related to the partial write-off of unamortized deferred
financing fees associated with the 2000 Credit Agreement. See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $50.6 million or $0.73 per diluted share after an extraordinary loss of $1.3 million
(or $0.02 per share). After an extraordinary loss of $4.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share, as discussed above, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $65.5 million or $0.96 per diluted share.

Funds from Operations

Funds from operations (“FFO”) for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 totaled $95.2 million, $93.5 million and $76.5 million, respectively. FFO net of the gain on the sale of the Kindred Common Stock and the net loss on swap breakage (“Normalized FFO”) for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $95.6 million and $78.1 million, respectively. FFO for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 is summarized in the following table:

The
Company considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT and the Company uses the NAREIT definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real
estate property, plus depreciation for real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact
that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company’s financial performance or as an alternative to cash
flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company’s liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. The Company believes that in order
to facilitate a clear understanding of its consolidated historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Asset/Liability Management

Asset/liability management is a key element of the
Company’s overall risk management program. The objective of asset/liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels. The asset/liability management process focuses on a variety
of risks, including market risk (primarily interest rate risk) and credit risk. Effective management of these risks is an important determinant



of the absolute levels and variability of FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses the Company’s integrated management of
assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Market Risk

The following discussion of the Company’s exposure to various market risks contains “forward-looking statements” that
involve risks and uncertainties. These projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to the Company. Nevertheless, because of the inherent unpredictability of
interest rates as well as other factors, actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking information.

The Company receives revenue primarily by leasing its assets under leases that are long-term triple net leases in which the rental rate is
generally fixed with annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. The Company also earns revenue from the its mezzanine loan to THI. The Company’s obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement are (and its obligations under the 2000 Credit
Agreement were) floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly interest payments vary with the movement in LIBOR. See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The general fixed
nature of the Company’s assets and the variable nature of the Company’s obligations create interest rate risk. If interest rates were to rise significantly, the Company’s lease and other revenue might not be sufficient to meet its
debt obligations. In order to mitigate this risk, in connection with the 1998 Spin Off, the Company entered into the 1998 Swap to effectively convert most of its floating rate debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations. Interest rate swaps
generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments on an underlying notional amount. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had a $425.0 million interest rate swap outstanding (the “1998 Swap”) with a highly rated
counterparty in which the Company pays a fixed rate of 5.985% and receives LIBOR from the counterparty.

On September 28, 2001, the Company entered into a second interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of $450.0 million (the
“2003-2008 Swap”) with a highly rated counterparty to hedge floating rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008, under which the Company will pay a fixed rate of 5.385% and will receive LIBOR from the counterparty to
this agreement. The 2003-2008 Swap is treated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes. There are no collateral requirements under the 2003-2008 Swap. The notional amount of the 2003-2008 Swap is scheduled to decline from $450.0 million as of
July 1, 2003 as follows:

Notional Amount

Date

In
accordance with the terms of the CMBS Loan Agreement (as defined below), on December 11, 2001, Ventas Finance I, LLC (“Ventas Finance”) purchased an interest rate cap from a highly rated counterparty (the “Buy Cap”). See
“—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Facility” and “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Because the Company already hedged its consolidated interest rate risk through the
1998 Swap and the 2003-2008 Swap, on December 11, 2001 the Company sold an interest rate cap (the “Sell Cap”) for the same notional value ($225.0 million) and on the same terms (5 year amortizing 8% LIBOR cap) as the Buy Cap. If LIBOR
should exceed the 8% cap, the Sell Cap would require the Company to pay the counterparty and the Buy Cap would require the counterparty to pay Ventas Finance for the interest accruing in excess of the 8% LIBOR cap. The Buy Cap and the Sell Cap are
shown separately as an asset and a liability on the Company’s balance sheet, respectively. The Company believes that the economic substance of the Buy Cap offsets the net cash flow exposure of the Sell Cap.



When interest
rates rise, the interest rate swaps increase in fair value to the Company and when interest rates fall, the interest rate swaps decline in fair value to the Company. Similarly, when interest rates increase, the Buy Cap increases in fair value and
the Sell Cap decreases in fair value. As of December 31, 2002, interest rates had fallen and the 1998 Swap and the 2003-2008 Swap were in an unrealized loss position to the Company. Generally, interest rate swap agreements with longer terms evidence
greater dollar values of variation when interest rates change. To highlight the sensitivity of the interest rate swaps and caps to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis
points (BPS) in interest rates as of December 31, 2002:

The
carrying value of the Company’s variable rate debt approximates fair value. There is no cash flow impact from the fluctuation of interest rates since the Company currently hedges 100% of its variable rate debt. The fair value of the fixed rate
debt is $377.1 million based on open market trading activity provided by a third party.

Credit Risk

As a result of the 1998 Spin Off, the Company has a significant concentration of credit risk with Kindred under the Kindred Master Leases. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 lease rental revenues from Kindred
totaled $186.5 million or 98.4% and $181.0 or 98.7%, respectively, of the Company’s total rental and investment income for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2000, lease rental revenues from Kindred comprised 98.5% of the
Company’s total lease rental revenues. Accordingly, Kindred’s financial condition and ability to meet its rent obligations will largely determine the Company’s rental revenues and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders.
In addition, any failure by Kindred to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities. Kindred, as well as certain other tenants
of the Company, have experienced financial difficulty and/or filed for bankruptcy. Kindred emerged from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001. Despite Kindred’s emergence from bankruptcy, there can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient
assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Kindred Master Leases. Since the Company derives in excess of 98% of its rental revenues from Kindred and since the Kindred Master Leases are triple net leases
under which Kindred is responsible for all insurance, taxes and maintenance and repair expenses required in connection with the leased properties, the inability or unwillingness of Kindred to satisfy its obligations under the Kindred Master Leases
would have a material adverse effect on the condition of the Kindred leased properties, as well as a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. See “Business—Risk Factors—The Company is dependent on Kindred; Kindred’s inability or
unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with the Company could significantly harm the Company and its ability to service its indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to its stockholders as required to
continue to qualify as a REIT” and “Note 4—Concentration of Credit Risk” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company monitors its credit risk under its lease agreements with its tenants by, among other things, reviewing
and analyzing (a) information regarding the healthcare industry generally, (b) publicly available information regarding tenants, (c) information provided by the tenants and borrowers under the Company’s lease and other
agreements, and (d) discussion with tenants, borrowers and their representatives.



Liquidity and Capital
Resources

During 2002, the
Company’s principal sources of liquidity came from cash flow from operations, borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement, the issuance of the Senior Notes as defined below, disposition of assets, the Equity Offering (as defined below) and,
until the 2002 Refinancing Date (as defined below), the 2000 Credit Agreement.

The Company intends to continue to fund future investments through cash flow from operations, borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement, disposition of assets and issuance of secured or unsecured
long-term debt or other securities. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 million, restricted cash of $20.0 million (comprised of $5.0 million of reserves under the CMBS Facility (as defined below), escrows under
the THI Master Lease and the Company’s portion of the amounts on deposit pursuant to the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement), outstanding revolving credit borrowings of $59.3 million under the 2002 Credit Agreement, and unused revolving credit
availability of $185.3 million. Through the pledge of additional property as collateral to the lenders under the 2002 Credit Agreement, the Company, as of December 31, 2002, could have increased revolving credit availability to $231.0 million.

Net cash provided by operations totaled $116.4
million, $79.9 million and $85.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 cash flows is primarily a result of (a) the timing of interest payments on the Senior Notes and the 1998 Swap,
(b) increases from rent escalators and (c) reduction of interest expense.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $34.1 million. The Company invested $53.0 million in real property and $64.9 million in loan financing from the THI
Transaction (as defined below) which was financed through borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement. Investing activities also included $49.0 million in proceeds from the sale of the THI Senior Loan (as defined below), $28.6 million from the
sale of real property, $7.0 million from the sale of Kindred Common Stock and $2.0 million from origination fees. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 of $2.8 million included the proceeds
from the Company’s sale of 83,300 shares of Kindred common stock. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000 totaled $5.4 million and included proceeds from the sale of two nursing facilities.

Net cash used in financing totaled $98.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002. The uses include (a) an aggregate of $106.7 million payment of principal on the 2000 Credit Agreement, the 2002 Credit Agreement and the CMBS Loan, (b) $15.1 million in financing fees,
(c) $12.8 million in swap breakage costs, (d) $50.1 million of cash dividend payments, and (e) $10.8 million of principal payments on the United States Settlement. The financing uses are offset by net proceeds from the
issuance of common stock of $97.2 million, including the net proceeds of $93.6 million from the issuance of nine million shares (the “Equity Offering”) and $3.6 million from the exercise of stock options. Net cash used in
financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled $151.5 million and included payments of principal on the 2000 Credit Agreement in the aggregate amount of $263.0 million. $212.8 million of the payments were
funded from the CMBS Transaction (as defined below), which generated gross proceeds of $225 million. The 2001 financing activities also included $6.9 million in financing costs, $41.7 million payment on the United States Settlement,
and $65.3 million of cash dividend payments. For the year ended December 31, 2000, net cash used in financing activities was $142.9 and included dividend payments of $42.4 million, repayments of borrowings of $87.9 million and
deferred financing costs of $12.6 million.

On December 31, 2002, the Company repurchased $34.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes out of the proceeds of the Equity Offering. The Company purchased $783,000 of 2009 Senior Notes (as defined below) and $33,179,000 of 2012
Senior Notes (as defined below) in open market purchases. The total purchase price aggregated $37.4 million. As a result of these purchases, the Company reported an extraordinary loss of $4.2 million in the fourth quarter ended December
31, 2002. The Company has no current intention to repurchase any additional Senior Notes.



The 2000
Credit Agreement

On January 31, 2000, the
Company entered into the 2000 Credit Agreement. On April 17, 2002, the Company used the proceeds of the Senior Notes Offering (as defined below) and certain borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement, in addition to cash on hand, to repay all
outstanding indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement. See “—Use of Proceeds; Repayment of 2000 Credit Agreement.”

Tax Refund Escrow Agreement

Kindred and the Company have entered into the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement governing their relative entitlement to certain tax refunds for
the tax periods prior to and including May 1, 1998 (the “Subject Periods”) that each received or may receive in the future. Under the terms of the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement, refunds (“Subject Refunds”) received on or after
September 13, 1999 by either Kindred or the Company with respect to federal, state or local income, gross receipts, windfall profits, transfer, duty, value-added, property, franchise, license, excise, sales and use, capital, employment, withholding,
payroll, occupational or similar business taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to tax, but excluding certain refunds), for taxable periods ending on or prior to May 1, 1998, or including May 1, 1998 and received on or after September
13, 1999 (“Subject Taxes”) must be deposited into an escrow account with a third-party escrow agent.

The Tax Refund Escrow Agreement provides generally that Subject Taxes will be satisfied first from the funds in the escrow account (the
“Escrow Funds”). To the extent that the Escrow Funds are insufficient to satisfy all liabilities for Subject Taxes that are finally determined to be due (such excess amount, “Excess Taxes”), the relative liability of Kindred and
the Company to pay such Excess Taxes shall be determined as provided in the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement. Disputes under the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement, and the determination of the relative liability of Kindred and the Company to pay Excess Taxes,
if any, are governed by the arbitration provision of the Tax Allocation Agreement.

Interest earned on the Escrow Funds or included in refund amounts received from governmental authorities are distributed equally to each of Kindred and the Company on an annual basis and are accrued as
interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Any Escrow Funds remaining in the escrow account after no further claims may be made by governmental authorities with respect to Subject Taxes or Subject Refunds (because of the expiration
of statutes of limitation or otherwise) will be distributed equally to Kindred and the Company. See “Note 10—Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CMBS Transaction

On December 12, 2001, the Company raised $225.0 million in gross proceeds from the completion of a commercial
mortgage backed securitization transaction (the “CMBS Transaction”). Under a Loan and Security Agreement dated as of December 12, 2001 (the “CMBS Loan Agreement”), Ventas Finance obtained a loan in the principal amount of $225.0
million (the “CMBS Loan”) from Merrill Lynch Mortgage Lending, Inc., as lender (the “CMBS Lender”). The CMBS Loan bears interest at a weighted average of LIBOR plus 1.4651%. Principal of and interest on the CMBS Loan is payable
monthly. Principal payments on the CMBS Loan were calculated based upon a 25-year amortization schedule using an assumed interest rate of 9.46% per annum. The CMBS Loan matures on December 9, 2006, at which time a principal balloon payment of
approximately $211.0 million will be due, assuming all scheduled amortization payments are made and no prepayments are made on the CMBS Loan. The CMBS Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time and from time to time without penalty or
premium.

On December 12, 2001, the Company used
$212.8 million of the proceeds from the CMBS Loan to pay down a portion of the outstanding principal under the 2000 Credit Agreement. The Company recognized a $1.3 million extraordinary loss in the fourth quarter of 2001 relating to the partial
write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs as a result of the aforementioned prepayments under the 2000 Credit Agreement.



The CMBS Loan
is secured by liens on the 40 skilled nursing facilities (the “CMBS Properties”) transferred by Ventas Realty to Ventas Finance and leased to Kindred under a Kindred Master Lease (the “Kindred CMBS Master Lease”). Except for
certain customary exceptions, the CMBS Loan is non-recourse to Ventas Finance and the Company.

Ventas Finance is required to maintain or cause to be maintained the following reserve accounts under the CMBS Loan Agreement: (a) a debt service reserve account in an amount of $5.0 million to cover
shortfalls in cash available for debt service on the CMBS Loan, (b) an imposition and insurance reserve for the payment of real property taxes and insurance premiums with respect to the CMBS Properties, and (c) a replacement reserve account in the
amount of $1.58 million for the payment of the cost of capital improvements made to the CMBS Properties. The impositions and insurance reserve and the replacement reserve under the CMBS Loan Agreement are being funded and/or maintained by Kindred as
required under and in accordance with the terms of the Kindred CMBS Master Lease. If Kindred should be unwilling or unable to fund these reserves under the CMBS Loan Agreement, Ventas Finance will be required to fund and/or maintain such reserves.
Restricted cash at December 31, 2002 included $5.0 million related to the debt service reserve account for the CMBS Loan. See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The 2002 Credit Agreement

On April 17, 2002 (the “2002 Refinancing Date”),
the Company, as guarantor, and Ventas Realty, as borrower, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement. Under the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty obtained a $350.0 million credit facility (the “Total
Commitments”) consisting of a $60.0 million term loan (the “Tranche B Term Loan”) and a $290.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The 2002 Credit Agreement also permits Ventas Realty to
obtain an additional term loan in an amount of not less than $50.0 million, but not more than the remaining unused portion of the Total Commitments, subject to the conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement (the “Tranche C Term
Loan”). Subject to the terms of, and the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in, the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty has the option to increase the Total Commitments (in the form of term and/or revolving loans) to an amount not to
exceed $450.0 million.

The outstanding aggregate
principal balance of the Tranche B Term Loan, the Tranche C Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility may not collectively exceed either (a) the Borrowing Base (as described below) or (b) the Total Commitments. As of December 31, 2002,
the outstanding principal balance of the Tranche B Term Loan was $59.7 million and the outstanding principal balance under the Revolving Credit Facility was $59.3 million. As of December 31, 2002, there was no Tranche C Term Loan.

Amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility may be borrowed
and reborrowed from time to time, subject to the conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement; provided, however, that the Revolving Credit Facility matures and must be repaid in full on April 17, 2005. The principal amount of the Tranche B
Term Loan is payable in installments of $150,000 on the last day of each fiscal quarter, beginning September 30, 2002, and matures and must be repaid in full on April 17, 2007.

Borrowings outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement bear interest at an Applicable Percentage over either
(i) a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the higher of (a) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement) in effect for the relevant period, plus one half of one percent (0.5%) and (b) the Prime Rate (as defined in the 2002 Credit
Agreement) in effect for the relevant period (the “Base Rate”) or (ii) a fluctuating LIBOR-based rate per annum (the “Eurodollar Rate”). The Applicable Percentage varies based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio (as
defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement). With respect to Tranche B Term Loans, the Applicable Percentage is (a) 2.50% for loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate, and (b) 1.00% for loans bearing interest at the Base Rate. With respect
to revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, from the inception of the loan through December 31, 2002, the Applicable Percentage on the Eurodollar Rate was 2.75% and on the Base Rate was 1.25%.



Loans
outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement are pre-payable without premium or penalty, provided that loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate are subject to customary “breakage” costs if repaid prior to the end of an interest period.
Ventas Realty has agreed to pay various fees in connection with the 2002 Credit Agreement, including without limitation, issuance fees for letters of credit and fees for the unused portion of the total committed amount of the Revolving Credit
Facility. Ventas Realty may permanently reduce or terminate the total committed amount of the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement.

The Company (and any other owner of mortgaged property securing Ventas Realty’s obligations under the
2002 Credit Agreement from time to time) has guaranteed Ventas Realty’s obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement. Such obligations are secured by liens on certain of Ventas Realty’s real property assets and any related leases, rents and
personal property, and, at Ventas Realty’s option, may be secured by certain cash collateral from time to time. Currently, 59 real properties owned by Ventas Realty are mortgaged to secure the 2002 Credit Agreement (the “Borrowing Base
Properties”). All 59 Borrowing Base Properties are leased to Kindred pursuant to Master Lease No. 1.

The Borrowing Base under the 2002 Credit Agreement is, as determined at any time, an amount equal to the sum of (i) sixty-five percent
(65%) of the aggregate appraised property value of the Borrowing Base Properties, plus (ii) one hundred percent (100%) of amounts on deposit in certain cash collateral or pledged accounts. The aggregate principal amount of the obligations
outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement (including the revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Tranche B Term Loan and the Tranche C Term Loan) may not at any time exceed the Borrowing Base. As of December 31, 2002, the
Borrowing Base was $304.3 million, and the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement was $119.0 million, and the remaining availability under the 2002 Credit Agreement was $185.3 million.
Ventas Realty may at any time include additional real estate assets (which must satisfy certain conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement) in the Borrowing Base to increase its remaining availability, up to the Total Commitments. Subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty may also obtain a release of various Borrowing Base Properties from the liens and security interests encumbering such properties.

The 2002 Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive
covenants and various potential events of default and is, among other things, cross-defaulted with certain other indebtedness and obligations of Ventas Realty and the Company. See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Senior Notes Offering

On the 2002 Refinancing Date, Ventas Realty
and Ventas Capital Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ventas Realty (collectively, the “Issuers”), completed the offering (the “Senior Notes Offering”) of 8-3/4% Senior Notes due 2009 in the aggregate principal amount
of $175.0 million (the “2009 Senior Notes”) and 9% Senior Notes due 2012 in the aggregate principal amount of $225.0 million (the “2012 Senior Notes” and, together with the 2009 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”).
The 2009 Senior Notes and the 2012 Senior Notes were issued under separate Indentures, each dated as of April 17, 2002 (collectively, the “Indentures”) and mature on May 1, 2009 and May 1, 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2002,
$174.2 million principal amount was outstanding under the 2009 Senior Notes and $191.8 million principal amount was outstanding under the 2012 Senior Notes.

The Senior Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and by certain of the Company’s current
and future subsidiaries as described in the Indentures (collectively, the “Guarantors”). The Senior Notes are part of the general unsecured obligations of the Company and Ventas Realty, rank equal in right of payment with all existing and
future senior obligations of the Company and Ventas Realty, and rank senior to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company and Ventas Realty. However, the Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to all borrowings under the
2002 Credit Agreement with



respect to Borrowing Base Properties and any future assets securing indebtedness under the 2002 Credit Agreement. In addition, the Senior
Notes are structurally subordinated to approximately $222.7 million of indebtedness relating to the CMBS Transaction that is secured by the CMBS Properties. The Issuers may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption
price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption and a make-whole premium as described in the Indentures.

If the Company experiences certain kinds of changes of control, as described in the Indentures, the Issuers must make an offer to
repurchase the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase; provided, however, that in the event Moody’s and S&P
have confirmed their ratings of the Senior Notes and certain other conditions are met as set forth in the Indentures, this repurchase obligation will not apply.

The Indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants. See “Note 7 —Borrowing Arrangements”
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Scheduled Maturities of Borrowing Arrangements

The Company’s indebtedness has the following maturities (in thousands):

Use
of Proceeds; Repayment of 2000 Credit Agreement

On April 17, 2002, the Company used (i) the $400.0 million gross proceeds from the Senior Notes Offering, (ii) $220.3 million of borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement (consisting of $60.0 million of
borrowings under the Tranche B Term Loan and $160.3 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) and (iii) approximately $14.3 million cash on hand to: (a) repay all outstanding indebtedness under the 2000 Credit
Agreement, (b) pay certain closing costs, fees and expenses, and (c) pay a one-time $13.6 million breakage cost relating to the termination of $350.0 million notional amount of the 1998 Swap. The $13.6 million breakage cost is composed of (i) a
$12.8 million swap breakage fee and (ii) $0.8 million of accrued interest on the terminated $350.0 million notional amount for the period April 1, 2002 through April 17, 2002. The Company recorded a $6.9 million extraordinary loss in the quarter
ended June 30, 2002 to write-off unamortized deferred financing costs relating to the 2000 Credit Agreement.

Dividends

In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company must make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90% of its
“REIT taxable income” (excluding net capital gain). The Company declared dividends greater than 100% of its estimated taxable income for 2002. The Company declared or assigned dividends equal to or greater than 100% of its taxable income
for 2001 and 95% for 2000. The Company intends to pay a dividend for 2003 equal to $1.07 per common share, but not less than 100% of the Company’s taxable income for 2003. The Company intends to pay the 2003 dividend with cash but may also pay
by a combination of cash and other property or securities, including shares of Kindred Common Stock.

It is expected that the Company’s REIT taxable income will be less than its cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other
non-cash deductions in computing REIT taxable income. However, for 2001 this was



partially offset by the value of the Kindred Common Stock received by the Company on the Kindred Effective Date which is included in taxable
income in 2001. The Company anticipates that it generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable it to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. It is possible, however, that the Company, from time to time, may not have sufficient cash
or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation.

Capital Expenditures and Property Acquisitions

Capital expenditures to maintain and improve the leased properties generally will be incurred by the
Company’s tenants. Accordingly, the Company does not believe that it will incur any major expenditures in connection with the leased properties. After the terms of the leases expire, or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to
meet their obligations under the leases, the Company anticipates that any expenditures relating to the maintenance of leased properties for which it may become responsible will be funded by cash flows from operations or through additional
borrowings. To the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required, the Company’s liquidity may be affected adversely. The Company’s ability to make expenditures and borrow funds is restricted by the terms of
the 2002 Credit Agreement and the Indentures.

Shelf Registration Statement and Equity Offering

On June 19, 2002, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Commission relating to $750.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares and warrants. The
registration statement became effective on July 8, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, $651.0 million of these securities remained available for offering under the shelf registration statement.

During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002, the Company commenced and completed an equity offering of
the Company’s common stock with Tenet Healthcare Corporation (“Tenet”). Immediately prior to the completion of the Equity Offering, Tenet held 8,301,067 shares of Ventas common stock. The Equity Offering consisted of 9,000,000 newly
issued shares of common stock sold by Ventas and 8,301,067 shares of Ventas common stock owned and sold by Tenet, all priced at $11.00 per share. After the Equity Offering, Tenet held no shares of Ventas common stock. The net proceeds received by
Ventas from its sale of its newly issued common stock were $93.6 million and were used to repay outstanding indebtedness, including the indebtedness incurred by the Company to invest in the THI Transaction.

Agreement of Indemnity —Third-Party Leases and
Contracts

In connection with the 1998 Spin
Off, the Company assigned its former third party lease obligations and third party guarantee agreements to Kindred. The Company believes that the aggregate exposure under its third party lease obligations is approximately $36.4 million. The Company
believes that it has no material exposure under the third party guarantee agreements. See “Note 11—Transactions with Kindred” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other

In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a $96.5 million charge related to the United States Settlement. Under the United
States Settlement, the Company is required to pay $103.6 million to the federal government, of which $34.0 million was paid on the Kindred Effective Date. The balance of $69.6 million bears interest at 6% per annum and is payable in equal quarterly
installments over a five-year term commencing on June 30, 2001. The charge in the fourth quarter of 2000 was discounted for accounting purposes based on an imputed borrowing rate of 10.75%. The Company will be required to pay $16.2 million in
principal and interest in 2003 under the United States Settlement.



The Company
has outstanding loans, with interest provisions of approximately $4.1 million, net of repayments, to certain current and former executive officers of the Company to finance the income taxes payable by them as a result of the vesting of common stock
of the Company awarded as compensation to such officers and the 1998 Spin Off. The loans are payable over periods ranging from a four to a ten year period beginning in each case on the date such loan was made. See “Note 16—Related Party
Transactions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Within the 90-day period prior to the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to timely alert them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated
subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s Exchange Act filings. There were no significant changes in the Company’s internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date of
the evaluation.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Stockholders and Board of Directors

Ventas, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ventas, Inc. as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).
These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Ventas, Inc. at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2002 the Company adopted the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2001 the Company changed its method
of accounting for derivative instruments.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note
1—Description of Business

Ventas, Inc.
(“Ventas” or the “Company”) is a healthcare real estate investment trust (“REIT”) with a geographically diverse portfolio of healthcare related facilities. As of December 31, 2002, this portfolio consisted of 44
hospitals, 220 nursing facilities and nine other healthcare and senior housing facilities in 37 states. The Company leases these facilities to healthcare operating companies under “triple-net” or “absolute-net” leases. As of
December 31, 2002, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Kindred”) lease 210 of the Company’s nursing facilities and all but one of the Company’s hospitals. The Company also has investments relating to 25
healthcare and senior housing facilities located in Ohio and Maryland. The Company operates in one segment which consists of financing, owning and leasing healthcare-related and senior housing facilities. See “Note 2—Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies.”

The Company conducts
substantially all of its business through a wholly owned operating partnership, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership (“Ventas Realty”) and an indirect, wholly owned limited liability company, Ventas Finance I, LLC (“Ventas
Finance”). As of December 31, 2002, Ventas Finance owned 40 of the Company’s skilled nursing facilities, the Company owned two of the hospitals and Ventas Realty owned all of the Company’s other properties and investments.

Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting
Standards

In April 2002, the FASB issued
145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 1, and Technical Correction” (“SFAS No. 145”). Statement 4, “Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt” (“SFAS No.
4”), required that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt that were included in the determination of net income be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 related to the
rescission of SFAS No. 4 will require the Company to reclassify prior period items into continuing operations, including those recorded in the current period, that do not meet the extraordinary classification. Additionally, future gains and losses
related to debt extinguishment may be required to be classified in income from continuing operations. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 become effective in fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The Company,
from time to time, incurs such charges and is currently assessing the impact that this statement will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Derivative Instruments

In June of 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting (“SFAS”)
No. 138 “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities,” which amends SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS No. 133”). SFAS No. 133, as
amended, requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. As discussed in “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements,” the Company uses derivative instruments to protect against the
risk of interest rate movements on future cash flows under its variable rate debt agreements. On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, and at that time, designated anew the derivative instruments in accordance with the requirements of
the new standard. The adoption of the standard as of January 1, 2001 resulted in the recognition of a liability of $4.1 million to reflect the fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap agreement and an identical reduction to other
comprehensive income, a component of stockholders’ equity. In addition, the $21.6 million deferred gain recognized on a terminated derivative position (See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements”) was reclassified to other comprehensive
income, resulting in a cumulative adjustment to other comprehensive income of $17.5 million. The FASB continues to issue interpretive guidance that could require changes in the Company’s application of the standard. SFAS No. 133 may increase or
decrease reported net income and stockholders’ equity prospectively, depending on future levels of interest rates, the computed “effectiveness” of the derivatives, as that term is defined by SFAS No. 133, and other variables affecting
the fair values of derivative instruments and

F-7


hedged items, but will have no effect on cash flows. The Company reports its derivative instruments at fair value on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivatives deemed to be eligible for hedge accounting are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income exclusive of ineffectiveness amounts which are reported in the Statement of Operations. As of December
31, 2002, a $31.6 million net unrealized loss on the derivatives is included in Accumulated Comprehensive Income. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are not eligible for hedge accounting are reported in the Statement of Operations.
See “Note 8—Fair Values of Financial Instruments.” Fair value of derivative instruments are estimated by a third party consultant.

Discontinued Operations

In accordance with SFAS 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets,” (“SFAS 144”)
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, the results of operations and gain/(loss) on real estate properties sold or held for sale subsequent to December 31, 2001 are reflected in the
consolidated statements of operations as “Discontinued Operations” for all periods presented. Interest expense allocated to Discontinued Operations has been estimated based on a proportional allocation of rental income among all of the
Company’s facilities.

Basis of
Presentation

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company, Ventas Realty, Ventas Finance and all direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation.

Real Estate
Investments

Investments in real estate
properties are recorded at cost. The cost of the properties acquired is allocated between land and buildings based generally upon independent appraisals. Depreciation for buildings is recorded on the straight-line basis, using estimated useful lives
ranging from 20 to 50 years.

Impairment of
Assets

Provisions for impairment losses
related to long-lived assets, if any, are recognized when expected future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the assets. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates the carrying value of the related real estate
investments in relationship to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. The Company adjusts the net book value of leased properties and other long-lived assets to fair value, if the sum of the expected future cash flow or
sales proceeds is less than book value. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company did not recognize an impairment loss.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity date of three months or less when purchased. These investments are
stated at cost which approximates fair value.

Loan Receivable

The loan
receivable is stated at the unpaid principal balance net of net deferred origination fees. Net deferred origination fees are comprised of loan fees collected from the borrower net of certain direct costs. Net deferred origination fees are amortized
over the contractual life of the loan using the level yield method. Interest income on the loans receivable is recorded as earned.

F-8


Comprehensive Income

SFAS 130 “Reporting Comprehensive Income,” establishes guidelines for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in financial statements. Comprehensive income includes net income and all other
non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity during a period including unrealized gains and losses on equity securities classified as available–for-sale and unrealized fair value adjustments on certain derivative instruments.

Marketable Equity Securities

Marketable equity securities are classified as
available-for-sale and reported on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. As of December 31, 2002, a $5.5 million unrealized gain relating to the Kindred common stock owned by the Company is included in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income.

Deferred Financing
Costs

Deferred financing costs are
amortized as a component of interest expense over the terms of the related borrowings using a method that approximates a level yield, and are net of accumulated amortization of approximately $3.4 million and $4.6 million at December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

Rental revenue is recognized as earned over
the terms of the related leases which are treated as operating leases. Such income includes periodic increases based on pre-determined formulas as defined in the lease agreements. See “Note 11—Transactions with Kindred.” Certain
leases with tenants other than Kindred contain provisions relating to increases in rental payments over the terms of the leases. Rental income under these leases is recognized over the term of each lease on a straight-line basis.

Stock Based Compensation

The Company grants stock options to employees and directors
with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of the grant. In accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“Opinion No. 25”), compensation expense
is not recognized for these stock option grants.

In addition, the Company grants shares of restricted stock to certain executive officers and directors. Shares of restricted stock vest cumulatively in two to four equal annual installments beginning either on the date of grant or on
first anniversary of the date of the grant. In accordance with the provisions of Opinion No. 25, compensation expense is recognized for these restricted stock grants over the vesting period.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of rental revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Segment Reporting

The Company has one primary reportable segment, which consists of investment in real estate. The Company’s primary business is
financing, owning and leasing healthcare-related and senior housing facilities and leasing or subleasing such facilities to third parties, primarily Kindred. See “Note 4—Concentration of Credit Risk.” All of the Company’s leases
are triple-net leases, which require the tenants to pay all property related

F-9


expenses. The Company does not operate these facilities nor does it allocate capital to maintain the properties. Substantially all
depreciation and interest expenses, except for interest expense relating to the United States Settlement (as defined in “Note 11—Transactions with Kindred—Settlement of United States Claims”), reflected in the consolidated
statement of operations relate to the ownership of the Company’s investment in real estate.

Note 3—Revenues from Properties

Approximately 98.4% of the Company’s rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was derived from the four amended and restated master lease agreements dated as of April 20, 2001 between
Ventas Realty and Kindred (the “Kindred Amended Master Leases”) and the master lease agreement dated as of December 12, 2001 between Ventas Finance and Kindred (the “Kindred CMBS Master Lease,” and, collectively with the
Kindred Amended Master Leases, the “Kindred Master Leases”).

Each Kindred Master Lease is a “triple-net lease” or an “absolute-net lease” pursuant to which Kindred is required to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance and repairs related to the
properties.

Under each Kindred Master Lease, the
aggregate annual rent is referred to as Base Rent (as defined in each Kindred Master Lease). The initial aggregate annual Base Rent was $180.7 million from May 1, 2001 to April 30, 2002. For the period from May 1, 2002 through April 30, 2004,
Base Rent, payable all in cash, escalates on May 1 of each year at an annual rate of 3.5% over the Prior Period Base Rent (as defined in the Kindred Master Leases) if certain Kindred revenue parameters are met. Assuming such Kindred revenue
parameters are met, annual Base Rent under the Kindred Master Leases would be $192.4 million from May 1, 2003 to April 30, 2004.

Each Master Lease provides that beginning May 1, 2004, if Kindred refinances its senior secured indebtedness entered into in connection
with the Kindred Reorganization Plan or takes other similar action (a “Kindred Refinancing”), the 3.5% annual escalator will be paid in cash. If a Kindred Refinancing has not occurred, then on May 1, 2004, the annual aggregate Base Rent
will be comprised of (a) Base Rent payable in cash which will escalate annually by an amount equal to 2% of Prior Period Base Rent, and (b) an additional annual non-cash accrued escalator amount of 1.5% of the Prior Period Base Rent which will
accrete from year to year including an interest accrual at LIBOR (as defined in the Kindred Master Leases) plus 450 basis points (compounded annually) to be added to the annual accreted amount (but such interest will not be added to the aggregate
Base Rent in subsequent years) (the “Unpaid Accrued Rent”). The Unpaid Accrued Rent will become payable, and all future Base Rent escalators will be payable in cash, upon the occurrence of a Kindred Refinancing. Under certain
circumstances, the Company’s right to receive payment of the Unpaid Accrued Rent is subordinate to the receipt of payment by the lenders of Kindred’s senior secured indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of a Kindred Refinancing, the Base Rent
payable in cash will thereafter escalate at the annual rate of 3.5% and there will be no further accrual feature for rents arising after the occurrence of such events.

F-10


The future
contracted minimum rentals, excluding rent escalations and excluding the amortization of the value of the Kindred common stock and the $4.5 million in cash received on the date Kindred’s plan of reorganization (the “Kindred Reorganization
Plan”) became effective (the “Kindred Effective Date”), but with normalized rents where applicable, for the remainder of the initial terms of the Kindred Master Leases and the Company’s leases with tenants other than Kindred are
as follows (see “Note 11—Transactions with Kindred”):

(1)

Excludes contractual rent obligations from certain tenants that are currently in default under the terms of their respective leases.

Note 4—Concentration of Credit Risk

As of December 31, 2002, 71.4% of the Company’s real
estate properties related to skilled nursing facilities, based on the original cost of such investments. The remaining real estate properties consist of hospitals, assisted living facilities and personal care facilities and real estate loans. The
Company’s facilities are located in 37 states with rental revenues from operations in only one state accounting for more than ten percent (10%) of the Company’s rental revenues. Approximately 93.8% of the Company’s real estate
properties, based on the original cost of such investments, are operated by Kindred and approximately 98.4% of rental revenue in 2002 was derived from the Kindred Master Leases.

Because the Company leases substantially all of its properties to Kindred and Kindred is the primary source
of the Company’s rental revenues, Kindred’s financial condition and ability and willingness to satisfy its rent obligations under the Kindred Master Leases and certain other agreements will significantly impact the Company’s rental
revenues and its ability to service its indebtedness and its obligations under the United States Settlement (as defined in “Note 11—Transactions with Kindred—Settlement of United States Claims”) and to make distributions to its
stockholders. On September 13, 1999, Kindred filed for protection under the Bankruptcy Code with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, and the Kindred Plan of Reorganization became effective and Kindred emerged from
bankruptcy on April 20, 2001. Despite Kindred’s emergence from bankruptcy, there can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Kindred Master
Leases or that Kindred will perform its obligations under the Kindred Master Leases. The inability or unwillingness of Kindred to satisfy its obligations under the Kindred Master Leases would have a material adverse effect on the business, financial
condition, results of operation and liquidity of the Company, on the Company’s ability to service its indebtedness and its obligations under the United States Settlement and on the Company’s ability to make distributions to its
stockholders as required to maintain its status as a REIT (a “Material Adverse Effect”).

On October 10, 2002, Kindred announced that it will record a substantial increase in costs related to professional liability claims,
primarily claims related to skilled nursing facility operations conducted in Florida. The cash rent from the 15 Florida skilled nursing facilities the Company leases to Kindred is approximately $8.5 million annually, which constitutes
approximately 4.6% of the total $186 million in annualized rent payable to the Company by Kindred. The Company believes that under the terms of its leases with Kindred, Kindred is not entitled to abandon the leased properties, reduce the rent, or
receive other concessions based on the increases in professional liability costs.

F-11


On December
11, 2002, Kindred publicly announced that it had entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Senior Health Management, LLC (“Senior Health Management”) to transfer the operations of Kindred’s 18 skilled nursing facilities in
Florida, including the 15 skilled nursing facilities in Florida that Kindred leases from the Company, and to sublease the Company’s 15 facilities to Senior Health Management or its designee. The announcement indicated that consummation of the
proposed transaction is subject to a number of material closing conditions, including approval from Kindred’s lenders and regulatory and governmental approvals. Kindred stated that the lease payments under the proposed subleases would be equal
to the lease payments under the primary leases and that Kindred will remain a primary obligor under the lease with the Company. The Company believes that it has the right to consent to the proposed sublease of the 15 skilled facilities in Florida
held by Kindred, and intends to defend vigorously any legal actions arising out of its withholding of such consent. However, there can be no assurance as to what the outcome of any such action on the part of Kindred might be or the ultimate effects
it might have on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or the share price of the Company’s common stock.

The Company has been discussing strategic alternatives regarding the skilled nursing facilities in Florida with Kindred. The Company
currently intends to work with Kindred to permit it to exit the Florida skilled nursing facility market on terms acceptable to the Company. The Company is evaluating its alternatives in the event no agreement is reached with Kindred, including the
initiation of legal proceedings. However, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of the Company’s discussion with Kindred or when or if any exit by Kindred from the Florida skilled nursing facility market will occur.

Note 5—Dispositions

In accordance with SFAS 144 effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, the results of operations and gain/(loss) on real estate properties sold or held for sale subsequent to December 31, 2001 are reflected in the consolidated statements of
operations as “Discontinued Operations” for all periods presented. Interest expense allocated to Discontinued Operations has been estimated based on a proportional allocation of rental income among all of the Company’s facilities.

On March 13, 2002, the Company sold a 125
licensed bed skilled nursing facility located in Las Vegas, Nevada to an unrelated third party for $1.8 million and recognized a gain of $1.1 million which was reported as a component of Discontinued Operations. The Company applied net proceeds of
$1.5 million as a prepayment of the Company’s indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement. On June 21, 2002, the Company sold a 164 licensed bed hospital facility located in Arlington, Virginia to an unrelated third party and recognized a gain
of approximately $22.4 million. The Company applied net proceeds of $27.1 million as a prepayment of the Company’s indebtedness under the 2002 Credit Agreement.

F-12


Set forth
below is a summary of the results of operations of the Arlington hospital and the Las Vegas skilled nursing facility through their respective disposition dates:

Note 6—Other
Acquisitions and Dispositions

Transactions with Trans Healthcare, Inc.

On November 4, 2002, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Ventas Realty, completed a $120.0 million transaction (the “THI Transaction”) with Trans Healthcare, Inc., a privately owned long-term care and hospital
company (“THI”). The THI Transaction was structured as a $53.0 million sale leaseback transaction (the “THI Sale Leaseback”) and a $67.0 million loan (the “THI Loan”), comprised of a first mortgage loan (the “THI
Senior Loan”) and a mezzanine loan (the “THI Mezzanine Loan”). Following a sale of the THI Senior Loan in December 2002 (see below), the Company’s investment in THI was $70.0 million.

As part of the THI Sale Leaseback, Ventas Realty purchased 5
properties and is leasing them back to THI under a “triple-net” master lease (the “THI Master Lease”). The properties subject to the Sale Leaseback are four skilled nursing facilities and one continuing care retirement community
that is comprised of one skilled nursing facility, one rehabilitation hospital, and one assisted living facility. Three of the properties are located in Maryland and two are located in Ohio. These properties contain a total of 770 beds. The THI
Master Lease, which has an initial term of ten years, provides for annual base rent of $5.9 million. The THI Master Lease provides that if THI meets specified revenue parameters, annual base rent will escalate each year by the greater of (i) three
percent or (ii) 50% of the consumer price index.

The THI Senior Loan, with an outstanding balance of approximately $50.0 million on December 27, 2002, is secured by 17 skilled nursing facilities and one related assisted living facility. Fourteen of these properties are located in
Ohio and four are located in Maryland. These properties contain a total of 1,402 beds. The THI Senior Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 367 basis points, inclusive of upfront fees (with a LIBOR floor of three percent). The THI Senior Loan matures in
three years, and THI holds options to exercise two one-year extensions upon satisfaction of certain conditions.

The THI Mezzanine Loan, with a current principal balance of approximately $17.0 million, bears interest, inclusive of upfront fees, of 18%
per annum and is secured by equity pledges in THI and certain of its subsidiaries that own and operate the 18 facilities that also collateralize the THI Senior Loan, liens on four additional healthcare/senior housing properties, and interests in
three additional properties operated by THI. The THI Transaction collectively covers a total of 32 facilities: 18 skilled nursing facilities, four assisted living facilities, and one rehabilitation hospital containing 1,546 beds in Ohio; and nine
skilled nursing facilities containing 1,206 beds in Maryland. Annualized interest on the THI Mezzanine Loan is expected to be approximately $3.0 million. The Company funded the transaction by drawing on its revolving credit facility

F-13


under its Second Amended and Restated Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2002 (the “2002 Credit
Agreement”).

Sale of THI Senior Loan

On December 27, 2002, the Company sold the
THI Senior Loan to GE Capital Credit Corporation (“GECC”), generating net proceeds of $49.0 million, recognizing a minimal gain as a result of the sale.

Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements

The following is a summary of the Company’s long-term debt and certain interest rate and maturity
information as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 (in thousands):

The
2000 Credit Agreement

On January 31, 2000,
the Company entered into the 2000 Credit Agreement. The loans under the 2000 Credit Agreement were pre-payable without premium or penalty. The 2000 Credit Agreement was secured by liens on substantially all of the Company’s real property and
any related leases, rents and personal property (other than the 40 skilled nursing facilities securing the CMBS Loan (as defined below)). On April 17, 2002, the Company used the proceeds of the Senior Notes Offering and certain borrowings under the
2002 Credit Agreement, in addition to cash on hand, to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement. See “—Use of Proceeds; Repayment of 2000 Credit Agreement.”

CMBS Transaction

On December 12, 2001, the Company raised $225 million in
gross proceeds from the completion of a commercial mortgage backed securitization transaction (the “CMBS Transaction”). Under a Loan and Security

F-14


Agreement dated as of December 12, 2001 (the “CMBS Loan Agreement”), Ventas Finance obtained a loan in the principal amount of
$225.0 million (the “CMBS Loan”) from Merrill Lynch Mortgage Lending, Inc., as lender (the “CMBS Lender”). The CMBS Loan is comprised of six components (i) a component in the original principal amount of $125,230,000 which bears
interest at LIBOR plus 0.8665%; (ii) a component in the original principal amount of $17,970,000 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.1665%; (iii) a component in the original principal amount of $8,860,000 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.5165%;
(iv) a component in the original principal amount of $26,830,000 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.9665%; (v) a component in the original principal amount of $26,830,000 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.6665%; and (vi) a component in the
original principal amount of $19,280,000 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.1665%. Principal of and interest on the CMBS Loan is payable monthly. Principal payments on the CMBS Loan were calculated based upon a 25-year amortization schedule using
an assumed interest rate of 9.46% per annum. The CMBS Loan matures on December 9, 2006, at which time a principal balloon payment of approximately $211.0 million will be due, assuming all scheduled amortization payments are made and no prepayments
are made on the CMBS Loan. The CMBS Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time and from time to time without penalty or premium.

On December 12, 2001, the Company used $212.8 million of the proceeds from the CMBS Loan to pay down a portion of the outstanding
principal under the 2000 Credit Agreement. The Company recognized a $1.3 million extraordinary loss relating to the partial write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs as a result of the aforementioned prepayments under the 2000 Credit
Agreement.

The CMBS Loan is secured by liens on
the 40 skilled nursing facilities (the “CMBS Properties”) transferred by Ventas Realty to Ventas Finance and leased to Kindred under a Kindred Master Lease (the “Kindred CMBS Master Lease”). Except for certain customary
exceptions, the CMBS Loan is non-recourse to Ventas Finance and the Company.

Ventas Finance is required to maintain or cause to be maintained the following reserve accounts under the CMBS Loan Agreement: (a) a debt service reserve account in an amount of $5.0 million to cover
shortfalls in cash available for debt service on the CMBS Loan, (b) an imposition and insurance reserve for the payment of real property taxes and insurance premiums with respect to the CMBS Properties, and (c) a replacement reserve account in the
amount of $1.58 million for the payment of the cost of capital improvements made to the CMBS Properties. The impositions and insurance reserve and the replacement reserve under the CMBS Loan Agreement are being funded and/or maintained by Kindred as
required under and in accordance with the terms of the Kindred CMBS Master Lease. If Kindred should be unwilling or unable to fund these reserves under the CMBS Loan Agreement, Ventas Finance will be required to fund and/or maintain such reserves.
Restricted cash at December 31, 2002 included $5.0 million related to the debt service reserve account for the CMBS Loan.

Monthly rental amounts under the Kindred CMBS Master Lease are deposited directly by Kindred into a central account for the benefit of the
CMBS Lender. Amounts in the central account are applied to pay the monthly principal and interest payments on the CMBS Loan and to fund the reserve accounts required under the CMBS Loan Agreement. Amounts remaining in the central account after the
payment of the current month’s principal and interest payment and the funding of the reserve accounts are distributed to Ventas Finance, provided no event of default has occurred and is continuing under the CMBS Loan Agreement and provided a
Cash Flow Sweep Event (as defined below) has not occurred. The central account is swept on a daily basis.

During the continuance of an event of default or a Cash Flow Sweep Event, all amounts in the central account in excess of the current
month’s principal and interest payment and the required reserve payments will be deposited into an account and applied as a prepayment of the CMBS Loan on the next monthly payment date. A “Cash Flow Sweep Event” occurs as of any date
of determination if (the “Coverage Test”) (a) the ratio of (i) the aggregate net cash flow from the CMBS Properties for the applicable quarter to (ii) the debt service on the CMBS Loan for the same quarter, is less than 1.50 to 1, or
(b) the aggregate net cash flow from the CMBS Properties for the applicable quarter does not equal or exceed the rent payable under the Kindred CMBS Master Lease for the same quarter. No Cash Flow Sweep Event will occur at any time while the
Coverage Test is satisfied.

The 2002
Credit Agreement

On April 17, 2002 (the
“2002 Refinancing Date”), the Company, as guarantor, and Ventas Realty, as borrower, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (the “2002 Credit Agreement”). Under the 2002 Credit
Agreement, Ventas Realty obtained a $350.0 million credit facility (the “Total Commitments”) consisting of a $60.0 million term loan (the “Tranche B Term Loan”) and a $290.0 million revolving credit facility (the
“Revolving Credit Facility”). The 2002 Credit Agreement also permits Ventas Realty to obtain an additional term loan in an amount of not less than $50.0 million, but not more than the remaining unused portion of the Total Commitments,
subject to the conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement (the “Tranche C Term Loan”). Subject to the terms of, and the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in, the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty has the option to
increase the Total Commitments (in the form of term and/or revolving loans) to an amount not to exceed $450.0 million.

The outstanding aggregate principal balance of the Tranche B Term Loan, the Tranche C Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility may not
collectively exceed either (a) the Borrowing Base (as described below) or (b) the Total Commitments. As of December 31, 2002, the outstanding principal balance of the Tranche B Term Loan was $59.7 million and the outstanding principal balance
under the Revolving Credit Facility was $59.3 million. As of December 31, 2002, there was no Tranche C Term Loan.

Amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility may be borrowed and reborrowed from time to time, subject to the conditions set forth in the
2002 Credit Agreement; provided, however, that the Revolving Credit Facility matures and must be repaid in full on April 17, 2005. The principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loan is payable in installments of $150,000 on the last day of each fiscal
quarter, beginning September 30, 2002, and matures and must be repaid in full on April 17, 2007.

Borrowings outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement bear interest at an Applicable Percentage over either (i) a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the higher of (a) the Federal Funds Rate (as
defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement) in effect for the relevant period, plus one half of one percent (0.5%) and (b) the Prime Rate (as defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement) in effect for the relevant period (the “Base Rate”) or (ii) a
fluctuating LIBOR-based rate per annum (the “Eurodollar Rate”). With respect to Tranche B Term Loans, the Applicable Percentage is (a) 2.50% for loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate, and (b) 1.00% for loans bearing interest at the
Base Rate (as defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement). With respect to revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility:

(a)

If the senior unsecured (non-credit enhanced) long term debt of Ventas Realty or the Company is rated BBB- or better by Standard & Poor’s
(“S&P”) and Baa3 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) (in the case of a split rating the lower rating will apply), the Applicable Percentage is as follows: (i) 0.25% for revolving loans bearing
interest at the Base Rate and (ii) 2.25% for revolving loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate.

(b)

Otherwise, the Applicable Percentage is based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement) as follows:

Pricing Level

The
Consolidated Leverage Ratio is generally the ratio of debt of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (excluding the United States Settlement, and net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) measured on the last day of the applicable fiscal
quarter, to EBITDA of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending as of such day, as more particularly described in the 2002 Credit Agreement. The Applicable Percentage as of the period
ended December 31, 2002 was based on pricing level II.

F-16


Loans
outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement are pre-payable without premium or penalty, provided that loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate are subject to customary “breakage” costs if repaid prior to the end of an interest period.
Ventas Realty has agreed to pay various fees in connection with the 2002 Credit Agreement, including without limitation, issuance fees for letters of credit and fees for the unused portion of the total committed amount of the Revolving Credit
Facility. Ventas Realty may permanently reduce or terminate the total committed amount of the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement.

The Company (and any other owner of mortgaged property securing Ventas Realty’s obligations under the
2002 Credit Agreement from time to time) has guaranteed Ventas Realty’s obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement. Such obligations are secured by liens on certain of Ventas Realty’s real property assets and any related leases, rents and
personal property, and, at Ventas Realty’s option, may be secured by certain cash collateral from time to time. Currently, 59 real properties owned by Ventas Realty are mortgaged to secure the 2002 Credit Agreement (the “Borrowing Base
Properties”). As of December 31, 2002, the carrying value of the 59 Borrowing Base Properties was $161.6 million. All 59 Borrowing Base Properties are leased to Kindred pursuant to Kindred Master Lease No. 1.

The Borrowing Base under the 2002 Credit Agreement is, as
determined at any time, an amount equal to the sum of (i) sixty-five percent (65%) of the aggregate appraised property value of the Borrowing Base Properties, plus (ii) one hundred percent (100%) of amounts on deposit in certain cash collateral or
pledged accounts. The aggregate principal amount of the obligations outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement (including the revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Tranche B Term Loan and the Tranche C Term Loan) may not at any
time exceed the Borrowing Base. As of December 31, 2002, the Borrowing Base was $304.3 million, and the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement was $119.0 million, and the remaining
availability under the 2002 Credit Agreement was $185.3 million. Ventas Realty may at any time include additional real estate assets (which must satisfy certain conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement) in the Borrowing Base to
increase its remaining availability, up to the Total Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty may also obtain a release of various Borrowing Base Properties from the liens and security
interests encumbering such properties.

The 2002
Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants, including, without limitation, covenants pertaining to (i) the incurrence of additional indebtedness; (ii) limitations on liens; (iii) customary restrictions on certain dividends,
distributions and other payments (the sum of all restricted payments made by the Company after the 2002 Refinancing Date cannot exceed the sum of (a) 95% of the Company’s aggregate cumulative FFO and (b) certain additional amounts further
described in the 2002 Credit Agreement); (iv) mergers, sales of assets and other transactions; (v) requirements regarding the maintenance of certain (a) consolidated leverage ratios, (b) consolidated fixed charge coverage ratios and (c)
consolidated adjusted net worth; (vi) transactions with affiliates; (vii) permitted business and development activities and uses of loan proceeds; and (viii) changes to material agreements. The 2002 Credit Agreement contains various potential events
of default and is, among other things, cross-defaulted with certain other indebtedness and obligations of Ventas Realty and the Company.

Senior Notes Offering

On the 2002 Refinancing Date, Ventas Realty and Ventas Capital Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ventas Realty (collectively, the
“Issuers”), completed the offering (the “Senior Notes Offering”) of 8-3/4% Senior Notes due 2009 in the aggregate principal amount of $175.0 million (the “2009 Senior Notes”) and 9% Senior Notes due 2012 in
the aggregate principal amount of $225.0 million (the “2012 Senior Notes” and, together with the 2009 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”). The 2009 Senior Notes and the 2012 Senior Notes were issued under separate Indentures, each
dated as of April 17, 2002 (collectively, the “Indentures”) and mature on May 1, 2009 and May 1, 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, $174.2 million principal

F-17


amount was outstanding under the 2009 Senior Notes and $191.8 million principal amount was outstanding under the 2012 Senior Notes.

The Senior Notes are unconditionally guaranteed
on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and by certain of the Company’s current and future subsidiaries as described in the Indentures (collectively, the “Guarantors”). The Senior Notes are part of the general unsecured obligations
of the Company and Ventas Realty, rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior obligations of the Company and Ventas Realty, and rank senior to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company and Ventas Realty.
However, the Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to all borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement with respect to Borrowing Base Properties and any future assets securing indebtedness under the 2002 Credit Agreement. In addition, the Senior
Notes are structurally subordinated to approximately $222.7 million of indebtedness relating to the CMBS Transaction that is secured by the CMBS Properties. The Issuers may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption
price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption and a make-whole premium as described in the Indentures.

If the Company experiences certain kinds of changes of control, as described in the Indentures, the Issuers must make an offer to
repurchase the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase; provided, however, that in the event Moody’s and S&P
have confirmed their ratings of the Senior Notes and certain other conditions are met as set forth in the Indentures, this repurchase obligation will not apply.

The Indentures contain covenants that limit the ability of the Company and certain of the Company’s
subsidiaries (collectively, the “Restricted Group”) to, among other things (i) incur debt, (ii) incur secured debt, (iii) make certain dividend payments, distributions and investments (the sum of all restricted payments made by the Company
after the 2002 Refinancing Date cannot exceed the sum of (a) 95% of the Company’s aggregate cumulative FFO and (b) certain additional amounts further described in the Indentures), (iv) enter into certain transactions, including transactions
with affiliates, (v) subject the Company’s subsidiaries to restrictions on dividends or other payments to the Company, (vi) merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the Restricted Group’s assets and (vii) sell assets.
These covenants are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications as described in the Indentures. The Restricted Group is also required to maintain total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of the Restricted Group’s unsecured debt. If the
Company obtains an investment grade rating, certain of these covenants will be suspended while such rating remains in effect.

Pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the Senior Notes Offering, on July 25, 2002, the Issuers and
Guarantors completed an offer to exchange the Senior Notes with a new series of notes that are registered under the Securities Act and are otherwise substantially identical to the outstanding Senior Notes, except that certain transfer restrictions,
registration rights and liquidated damages relating to the outstanding Senior Notes do not apply to the new notes. The Company did not receive any additional proceeds in connection with the exchange offer.

On December 31, 2002, the Company repurchased $34.0 million
principal of Senior Notes with a portion of the proceeds of the Equity Offering. The Company purchased $0.8 million principal of 2009 Senior Notes and $33.2 million principal of 2012 Senior Notes in open market purchases. The total purchase price
aggregated $37.4 million and is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as securities settlement due. As a result of these purchases, the Company reported an extraordinary loss of $4.2 million in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002. The
Company does not have any current intention to repurchase any additional Senior Notes.

Scheduled
Maturities of Borrowing Arrangements

The
Company’s indebtedness has the following maturities (in thousands):

Use
of Proceeds; Repayment of 2000 Credit Agreement

On April 17, 2002, the Company used (i) the $400.0 million gross proceeds from the Senior Notes Offering, (ii) $220.3 million of borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement (consisting of $60.0 million of borrowings under the Tranche
B Term Loan and $160.3 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) and (iii) approximately $14.3 million cash on hand to: (a) repay all outstanding indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement, (b) pay certain closing costs, fees
and expenses, and (c) pay a one-time $13.6 million breakage cost relating to the termination of $350.0 million notional amount of the 1998 Swap (defined below). The $13.6 million breakage cost is composed of (i) a $12.8 million swap breakage
fee and (ii) $0.8 million of accrued interest on the terminated $350.0 million notional amount for the period April 1, 2002 through April 17, 2002. The Company recorded a $6.9 million extraordinary loss to write-off unamortized deferred financing
costs relating to the 2000 Credit Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company also incurred an extraordinary loss of approximately $4.2 million relating to the write-off of the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with a
prior credit agreement.

Derivatives and
Hedging

In the normal course of business,
the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used
primarily to fix the rate on debt based on floating-rate indices and to manage the cost of borrowing obligations. The Company currently has two interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. The Company prohibits the use of derivative instruments
for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting
exposure that the derivative is designed to hedge, the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.

One of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements has a
notional principal amount as of December 31, 2002 of $425.0 million (the “1998 Swap”). Under the 1998 Swap the Company pays a fixed rate at 5.985% and receives LIBOR (floating rate) expiring June 30, 2003.

The terms of the 1998 Swap require that the Company make a
cash deposit or otherwise post collateral to the counterparty if the fair value loss to the Company exceeds certain levels (the “Threshold Level”). On April 17, 2002, in connection with the partial swap breakage payment, the Company
and the counterparty under the 1998 Swap agreed to reduce the Threshold Level to a nonvariable level of $20.0 million. The 1998 Swap was in an unrealized loss position to the Company of $9.8 million on December 31, 2002. Therefore, no collateral was
required to be posted.

On August 4, 1999, the
Company entered into an agreement with the 1998 Swap counterparty to shorten the maturity of the 1998 Swap from December 31, 2007 to June 30, 2003 in exchange for a payment in 1999 from

F-19


the counterparty to the Company of $21.6 million. The Company expects to amortize such amount for financial accounting purposes in future
periods beginning in July 2003 and ending December 2007, subject to the $7.4 million adjustment described below.

Prior to the 2002 Refinancing Date, the 1998 Swap had an $800.0 million notional amount. On the 2002 Refinancing Date, as a result of the
consummation of the Senior Notes Offering and the establishment of the new credit facility under the 2002 Credit Agreement, all of the outstanding indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement was repaid in full. Consequently, the Company no longer
expects variable rate debt held by the Company to exceed $450.0 million in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, on April 17, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with the 1998 Swap counterparty to break $350.0 million of the $800.0 million
1998 Swap notional amount in exchange for a payment to the counterparty of approximately $12.8 million. Additionally, a portion of the previously deferred gain recorded in connection with the 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of the 1998 Swap
also was impacted by the change in expectation. Based on the Company’s previous designation of the 1998 Swap to hedge the Company’s exposure to variable rate debt, the $12.8 million partial swap breakage cost and $7.4 million of the
approximately $21.6 million deferred gain, both of which were previously recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, were recognized as a net expense of $5.4 million in the Statement of Operations. The
balance of the $21.6 million (or $14.2 million deferred gain) will be amortized in the Company’s Statement of Operations as an offset to interest expense from July 1, 2003 through December 31, 2007.

The 1998 Swap is treated as a cash flow hedge. Cash flow
hedges address the risk associated with future cash flows of debt transactions. Over time, the unrealized gains and losses recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income will be reclassified into earnings in the
same periods in which the hedged interest payments affect earnings. Assuming no changes in interest rates, the Company estimates that approximately $8.7 million of the current balance recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income will be recognized as interest expense within the next twelve months consistent with historical reporting. The amount reclassified into interest expense on the 1998 Swap for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 was $23.9
million, excluding the $5.4 million net loss on swap breakage. In addition, a portion of the unrealized loss on the 1998 Swap previously reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income has been reclassified to operations for the year ended
December 31, 2002 to reflect the excess of the notional amount of the 1998 Swap and 2003- 2008 Swap over the anticipated variable rate debt balances in the future. An expense of $1.9 million has been recognized in the Statement of Operations to
reflect this anticipated overhedged position.

On
September 28, 2001, the Company entered into a second interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of $450.0 million (the “2003-2008 Swap”) to hedge floating-rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008, under
which the Company pays a fixed rate at 5.385% and receives LIBOR from the counterparty to the agreement. The 2003-2008 Swap is treated as a cash flow hedge. The amount reclassified into interest expense on the 2003-2008 Swap for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2002 was $0.8 million. Assuming no changes in interest rates, the Company estimates that approximately $9.7 million of the current balance recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income will
be recognized as interest expense within the next twelve months consistent with historical reporting. There are no collateral requirements under this agreement. The notional amount of the 2003-2008 Swap is $450.0 million and is scheduled to decline
as follows:

Notional Amount

Date

$300,000,000

June 30, 2006

150,000,000

June 30, 2007

—

June 30, 2008

The
Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of the non-performance by the counterparty to an interest rate swap agreement. However, the Company does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties to the 1998 Swap or the 2003-2008 Swap.

F-20


In accordance
with the terms of the CMBS Loan Agreement, on December 11, 2001, Ventas Finance purchased an interest rate cap from a highly rated counterparty (the “Buy Cap”). Because the Company already hedged its consolidated interest rate risk through
the 1998 Swap and 2003-2008 Swap, on December 11, 2001 the Company sold an interest rate cap (the “Sell Cap”) for the same notional value ($225.0 million) and on the same terms (5 year amortizing 8% LIBOR cap) as the Buy Cap. If LIBOR
should exceed the 8% cap, the Sell Cap would require the Company to pay the counterparty and the Buy Cap would require the counterparty to pay Ventas Finance for the interest accruing in excess of the 8% LIBOR cap. The Buy Cap and the Sell Cap are
shown separately as an asset and a liability on the Company’s balance sheet, respectively. The Company believes that the economic substance of the Buy Cap offsets the net cash flow exposure of the Sell Cap.

At December 31, 2002, the 1998 Swap and 2003-2008 Swap were
reported at their fair value of $47.7 million in liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The offsetting entry, exclusive of the $1.9 million ineffectiveness discussed above, is reported as a deferred loss in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income. The Buy and Sell Caps are reported at their fair value of approximately $1.3 million in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The offsetting adjustments for the Buy Cap and the
Sell Cap are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and net to zero.

Note 8—Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments.

•

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents reported in the balance sheet approximates fair value because of the short maturity of
these instruments.

•

Investment in Kindred Common Stock: The fair value is based on the quoted market value on December 31, 2002.

•

Real estate loan receivable: The fair value of the Company’s loan receivable approximates its net carrying value, based on rates offered for similar
arrangements.

•

Notes receivable from employees: The fair values of the notes receivable from employees are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates
being offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings.

•

Interest rate swap and cap agreements: The fair values of the Company’s interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements are based on rates being offered for
similar arrangements which consider forward yield curves and discount rates.

•

2000 Credit Agreement: The fair values of the Company’s borrowings under variable rate agreements approximate their carrying value.

•

2002 Credit Agreement: The fair values of the Company’s borrowings under variable rate agreements approximate their carrying value.

•

Senior Notes payable: The fair values of the Company’s borrowings under fixed rate agreements are estimated based on open market trading activity provided by a
third party.

•

United States Settlement: The fair value of the Company’s settlement with the United States approximates its carrying value.

•

Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities: The fair values of the Company’s borrowings under the CMBS Loan’s variable rate agreements approximate their
carrying value.

F-21


At December
31, 2002 and 2001 the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows (in thousands):

Fair
value estimates are subjective in nature and are dependent on a number of important assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows, risks, discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument.
The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would
realize in a current market exchange.

Note
9—Stockholders’ Equity and Stock Options

The Company has five plans under which options to purchase common stock have been, or may be, granted to officers, employees and non-employee directors and one plan under which certain directors may receive common stock of the
Company in lieu of director fees (the following are collectively referred to as the “Plans”): (1) The 1987 Incentive Compensation Program (Employee Plan); (2) The 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan); (3) The 1987 Stock Option
Plan for Non-Employee Directors; (4) The 2000 Stock Option Plan for Directors; (5) The TheraTx, Incorporated 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan; and (6) The Common Stock Purchase Plan for Directors (the “Directors Stock Purchase Plan”).
On May 23, 2000, the Company’s shareholders voted in favor of the amendment and restatement of the 1997 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors as the 2000 Stock Option Plan for Directors and the amendment and restatement of the 1997
Incentive Compensation Plan as the 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2000 Incentive Plan”). As part of the amendment and restatement of the 2000 Incentive Plan, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the number of shares
reserved for issuance under the 2000 Incentive Plan by 2.22 million shares and increased the maximum number of shares with respect to which stock options can be granted during a calendar year to any given individual to 750,000 shares.

Under the Plans (other than the Directors Stock Purchase
Plan), options are exercisable at the market price at the date of grant, expire ten years from the date of grant, and vest over varying periods ranging from one to four years. The Company has also granted options and restricted stock to certain
officers, employees and non-employee directors outside of the Plans. The options and shares of restricted stock that have been granted outside the Plans vest over varying periods and the options are exercisable at the market price at the date of
grant and expire ten years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2002, options for 3,794,092 shares had been granted to eligible participants and remained outstanding (including options granted prior to the 1998 Spin Off and held by Kindred
employees) under the provisions of the Plans. As of December 31, 2002, options for 391,361 shares had been granted outside of the Plans to certain employees and non-employee directors and remained outstanding. The Company granted 200,634, 308,250
and 466,705 shares of restricted stock for the years ended

December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The market value of the restricted shares on the date of the award has been recorded as
unearned compensation on restricted stock, with the unamortized balance shown as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Unearned compensation is amortized to expense over the vesting period, with charges to operations of approximately
$1.9 million in 2002, $1.7 million in 2001 and $1.3 million in 2000, respectively.

The Company only utilizes the 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan), the 2000 Stock Option Plan for Directors and the Directors Stock Purchase Plan for option and stock grants and stock
issuances. Under the terms of the Ventas, Inc. 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan), 5,620,000 shares are reserved for grants to be issued to employees. Under the terms of the Ventas, Inc. 2000 Stock Option Plan for Directors, 200,000
shares are reserved for grants or issuance to the chairman of the board and non-employee directors. Under the terms of the Directors Stock Purchase Plan, 200,000 shares are reserved for issuance to the chairman of the board and non-employee
directors in lieu of the payment of all or a portion of their retainer and meeting fees, at their option. As of December 31, 2002, the number of shares available for future grants or issuance under the Ventas, Inc. 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan
(Employee Plan), the Ventas, Inc. 2000 Stock Option Plan for Directors, and the Directors Stock Purchase Plan are 1,977,241, 88,000 and 181,284, respectively. No additional grants are permitted under the 1987 Incentive Compensation Program, the 1987
Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the TheraTx, Incorporated 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan. As a result, the shares reserved under these three Plans equal the options outstanding under such Plans. As of December 31, 2002, the
Company has reserved 2,200,023 shares for these Plans.

A summary of
stock options outstanding at December 31, 2002 follows:

In 1995,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS No. 123”). This standard prescribes a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options or similar equity instruments and requires
certain pro forma disclosures. For purposes of the pro forma disclosures required under SFAS No. 123, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the option’s vesting period. The estimated fair value of options granted
for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was approximately $337,100, $633,300 and $135,800, respectively.

The
Black-Scholes options valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company’s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

Note 10—Income Taxes

The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the “Code”), commencing with the year that ended December 31, 1999. The Company intends to continue to operate in such a manner as to enable it to qualify as a REIT. The Company’s actual qualification
and taxation as a REIT depends upon its ability to meet, on a continuing basis, distribution levels, stock ownership, and the various qualification tests imposed under the Code.

No net provision for income taxes has been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year
ended December 31, 2000 due to the Company’s belief that it qualified as a REIT, the distribution of 95% of its

F-24


2000 taxable income as a dividend and the existence of carryforward operating losses that offset the remaining 2000 liability for federal
corporate income taxes. As a result of the uncertainties relating to the Company’s ability to retain its operating loss carryforwards, the Company has recorded a provision for taxes on the 10% of its estimated 2001 taxable income which the
Company did not distribute as a dividend. The 5.0% effective tax rate for 2001 was determined based on the 35% federal statutory rate plus an incremental state rate less the dividends paid deduction. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company filed
its 2001 federal tax return on which it elected to apply certain 2002 dividend payments in excess of its 2002 taxable net income. As a result, the Company recorded a $2.2 million tax benefit for 2002.

The 2002 and 2001 provision (benefit) for income taxes
consists of the following including the provision on discontinued operations (in thousands):

Although
the Company believes that it satisfied the requirements to qualify as a REIT for the years ended December 31, 1999 through 2002 and although the Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT in subsequent years, it is possible that economic,
market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause the Company to fail, or elect not to, continue to qualify as a REIT in any such tax year.

The Company believes it has met the annual distribution requirement by payment of at least 90% of its estimated taxable income for 2002
and 2001. The Company believes that it met the annual distribution requirement for 2000 by payment of at least 95% of the estimated taxes for 2000. The Company’s dividends for the tax years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 constitute
ordinary income to the Company’s stockholders for tax purposes.

Net taxable income for federal income tax purposes results from net income for financial reporting purposes adjusted for the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, including
depreciation, prepaid rent, impairment losses on real estate, the United States Settlement liability, and the interest rate swap agreement. The net difference between tax bases of the Company’s asset and liabilities for federal income tax
purposes was $160.0 and $51.4 million more than the book bases of those assets and liabilities for financial reporting for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The Company made no income tax payments for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. The Company
utilized net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $1.0 million in 2000 to offset taxes due on the 5% of undistributed net taxable income of the Company for that year.

The Company has recorded a tax contingency liability of $7.1 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001 and $3.7
million at December 31, 2000 for contingencies arising from and prior to the 1998 Spin Off. Included in general administrative expenses on the Company’s statement of operations is a tax contingency expense of $1.5 million and $2.6 million
for 2001 and 2000, respectively, for federal, state, local, franchise and other miscellaneous taxes, net of the Company’s receipt of refunds referred to above.

As a former C corporation for federal income tax purposes, the Company potentially remains subject to
corporate level taxes for any asset dispositions for the period January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2008 (“built-in gains tax”). The amount of income potentially subject to this special corporate level tax is generally equal to (a) the
excess of the fair value of the asset as of December 31, 1998 over its adjusted tax basis as of December 31, 1998, or (b) the actual amount of gain, whichever of (a) and (b) is lower. Some but not all gains recognized during this period of time
could be offset by available net operating losses and capital loss

F-25


carryforwards. The deferred income tax liability of $30.4 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, reflects a previously established liability
to be utilized for any built-in gain tax incurred on assets that are disposed of prior to January 1, 2009. During 2001, the Company utilized $0.1 million of the deferred income tax liability in connection with a sales transaction.

On February 3, 2000 the Company received a refund (the
“Refund”) of approximately $26.6 million from the Internal Revenue Service representing $25.3 million from the refund of income taxes paid by it from 1996 and 1997 and $1.3 million from accrued interest thereon as a result of a carryback
of losses reported in the Company’s 1998 federal income tax return. The Company, Ventas Realty and Kindred entered into a stipulation relating to certain of these federal, state and tax refunds (including the Refund) on or about May 23, 2000
(the “Tax Stipulation”). On the Kindred Effective Date, Kindred and the Company entered into the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement and First Amendment of the Tax Allocation Agreement (the “Tax Refund Escrow Agreement”) governing their
relative entitlement to certain tax refunds for the tax periods prior to and including May 1, 1998 (the “Subject Periods”) that each received or may receive in the future. The Tax Refund Escrow Agreement amends and supplements the Tax
Allocation Agreement and supersedes the Tax Stipulation. See “Note 11—Transactions with Kindred—The Tax Refund Escrow Agreement and Tax Allocation Agreement.”

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is currently reviewing the federal income tax returns of the
Company for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998. On January 16, 2003, the Company agreed to a revised IRS Revenue Agent’s report quantifying the examination findings in connection with the 1997 and 1998 income tax periods. This report
concludes that, pending final review by the Joint Committee of Taxation, the Company does not owe any additional taxes, and is entitled to an additional refund of $1.2 million, for the period in question. If received, this $1.2 million would be
deposited into a joint tax escrow account between Ventas and Kindred. The revised report is under review by the Joint Committee of Taxation. Until the review of the Joint Committee of Taxation is final, however, there can be no assurance as to the
ultimate outcome of these matters or whether such outcome will have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

However, if there are any, the resulting tax liabilities for the tax years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998 will be satisfied first from
the use of Net Operating Loss (“NOL”) carryforwards (including the NOL carryforwards that were utilized to offset the Company’s federal income tax liability for 1999 and 2000) to satisfy those liabilities, and if the tax liabilities
exceed the amount of NOL carryforwards, then the Company will use the escrowed amounts under the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement. As of December 31, 2002, $29 million was escrowed under the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement. To the extent that NOL
carryforwards and escrowed amounts are not sufficient to satisfy such liabilities, Kindred has indemnified the Company for specific tax liabilities under the Tax Allocation Agreement. There can be no assurance that the NOL carryforwards and the
escrowed amounts will be sufficient to satisfy these liabilities or that Kindred has any obligation to indemnify the Company for particular liabilities or that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to
satisfy its indemnity obligations under the Tax Allocation Agreement or that Kindred will continue to honor such indemnification obligations.

The Company’s 1998 federal income tax return reflected capital loss carryforwards of approximately $200.1 million of which $0.6
million was carried back to 1996. The Company utilized $26.1 million and $16.4 million of capital loss carryforwards for the tax years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The remaining $157.0 million is available against future
capital gains, if any. After fully utilizing NOL carrybacks, the Company also has an NOL carryforward of $13.0 million at December 31, 2002. These amounts can be used to offset future taxable income (and/or taxable income for prior years if audits
of any prior year’s return determine that amounts are owed), if any, remaining after the dividends paid deduction. The Company will be entitled to utilize NOLs and tax credit carryforwards only to the extent that REIT taxable income exceeds the
Company’s deduction for dividends paid. The NOL carryforwards expire in 2018 and the capital loss carryforwards expire in 2003. The availability of the carryforwards are subject to the results of the IRS examination for the 1997-1998 tax years.

F-26


As a result of
the uncertainties relating to the ultimate utilization of favorable tax attributes described above, no net deferred tax benefit has been ascribed to capital loss and net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2001 and 2000. The IRS may
challenge the Company’s entitlement to these tax attributes during its current review of the Company’s tax returns for the 1997 and 1998 tax years. The Company believes it is entitled to these tax attributes, but there can be no assurance
as to the outcome of these matters.

Note 11—Transactions
with Kindred

Kindred Master Leases

Under the Kindred Reorganization Plan,
Kindred assumed its five pre-existing leases with the Company and Ventas Realty, which were then amended and restated Kindred Master Leases.

In connection with the consummation on December 12, 2001 of the CMBS Transaction, Ventas Realty removed 40 skilled nursing facilities from
Kindred Amended Master Lease No. 1 and placed the CMBS Properties in the Kindred CMBS Master Lease. Simultaneously with the closing of the CMBS Transaction, Ventas Realty transferred the CMBS Properties and the Kindred CMBS Master Lease to Ventas
Finance, the borrower under the CMBS Transaction.

On the Kindred Effective Date, the Company also received a $4.5 million cash payment as additional future rent under the Kindred Master Leases. The value of the Company’s Kindred common stock and the $4.5 million additional
future rent is amortized as future rent over the weighted average remaining term of the Kindred Master Leases for financial reporting purposes.

Each Kindred Master Lease includes land, buildings, structures and other improvements on the land, easements and similar appurtenances to
the land and improvements, and permanently affixed equipment, machinery and other fixtures relating to the operation of the properties covered by the Kindred Master Leases. There are several renewal bundles of properties under each Master Lease,
with each bundle containing a varying number of properties. All properties within a bundle have primary terms ranging from 10 to 15 years from May 1, 1998, subject to certain exceptions, and are subject to three five-year renewal terms.

For a discussion of the rent payable under the
Kindred Master Leases see “Note 3—Revenues from Properties.”

The Company has a one-time right to reset the rents under the Kindred Master Leases (the “Reset Right”), exercisable during a one-year period commencing July 19, 2006 by notice given on or
after January 20, 2006 on a Master Lease by Master Lease basis, to a then fair market rental rate, for a total fee of $5.0 million payable on a pro-rata basis at the time of exercise under the applicable Master Lease. The Reset Right under the
Kindred CMBS Master Lease can only be exercised in conjunction with the exercise of the Reset Right under Master Lease No. 1. The Company cannot exercise the Reset Right under the Kindred CMBS Master Lease without the prior written consent of the
CMBS Lender if, as a result of such reset, the aggregate rent payable for the CMBS Properties would decrease.

F-27


As a result of
the Company’s determination that such an amount was uncollectible, the Company wrote off approximately $48.3 million of rents receivable from tenants for the year ended December 31, 2000. The write-off consists of the following ($’s in
thousands):

Tax
Allocation Agreement, Tax Stipulation and Tax Refund Escrow Agreement

The Tax Allocation Agreement, entered into at the time of the 1998 Spin Off and described in more detail below, was assumed by Kindred under the Kindred Reorganization Plan and then amended and
supplemented by the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement, also described below. The Tax Stipulation, entered into by Kindred and the Company during the pendency of the Kindred bankruptcy proceedings, was superseded by the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement.

The Tax Allocation Agreement provides that
Kindred will be liable for, and will hold the Company harmless from and against, (i) any taxes of Kindred and its then subsidiaries (the “Kindred Group”) for periods after the 1998 Spin Off, (ii) any taxes of the Company and its then
subsidiaries (the “Company Group”) or the Kindred Group for periods prior to the 1998 Spin Off (other than taxes associated with the Spin Off) with respect to the portion of such taxes attributable to assets owned by the Kindred Group
immediately after completion of the 1998 Spin Off and (iii) any taxes attributable to the 1998 Spin Off to the extent that Kindred derives certain tax benefits as a result of the payment of such taxes. Under the Tax Allocation Agreement, Kindred
would be entitled to any refund or credit in respect of taxes owed or paid by Kindred under (i), (ii) or (iii) above. Kindred’s liability for taxes for purposes of the Tax Allocation Agreement would be measured by the Company’s actual
liability for taxes after applying certain tax benefits otherwise available to the Company other than tax benefits that the Company in good faith determines would actually offset tax liabilities of the Company in other taxable years or periods. Any
right to a refund for purposes of the Tax Allocation Agreement would be measured by the actual refund or credit attributable to the adjustment without regard to offsetting tax attributes of the Company.

Under the Tax Allocation Agreement, the Company would be
liable for, and would hold Kindred harmless against, any taxes imposed on the Company Group or the Kindred Group other than taxes for which the Kindred Group is liable as described in the above paragraph. The Company would be entitled to any refund
or credit for taxes owed or paid by the Company as described in this paragraph. The Company’s liability for taxes for purposes of the Tax Allocation Agreement would be measured by the Kindred Group’s actual liability for taxes after
applying certain tax benefits otherwise available to the Kindred Group other than tax benefits that the Kindred Group in good faith determines would actually offset tax liabilities of the Kindred Group in other taxable years or periods. Any right to
a refund would be measured by the actual refund or credit attributable to the adjustment without regard to offsetting tax attributes of the Kindred Group. See “Note 10—Income Taxes.”

Prior to and during the Kindred bankruptcy, the Company and
Kindred were engaged in disputes regarding the entitlement to federal, state and local tax refunds for the Subject Periods which had been received or which would be received by either company. Under the terms of the Tax Stipulation, the companies
agreed that the proceeds of certain federal, state and local tax refunds for the Subject Periods, received by either company on or after September 13, 1999, with interest thereon from the date of deposit at the lesser of the actual interest earned
and 3% per annum, were to be held by the recipient of such refunds in segregated interest bearing accounts.

F-28


On the Kindred
Effective Date, Kindred and the Company entered into the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement governing their relative entitlement to certain tax refunds for the Subject Periods that each received or may receive in the future. The Tax Refund Escrow Agreement
amends and supplements the Tax Allocation Agreement and supersedes the Tax Stipulation. Under the terms of the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement, refunds (“Subject Refunds”) received on or after September 13, 1999 by either Kindred or the
Company with respect to federal, state or local income, gross receipts, windfall profits, transfer, duty, value-added, property, franchise, license, excise, sales and use, capital, employment, withholding, payroll, occupational or similar business
taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to tax, but excluding certain refunds), for taxable periods ending on or prior to May 1, 1998, or including May 1, 1998 and received on or after September 13, 1999 (“Subject Taxes”) must
be deposited into an escrow account with a third-party escrow agent on the Kindred Effective Date.

The Tax Refund Escrow Agreement provides generally that Kindred and the Company waive their rights under the Tax Allocation Agreement to
make claims against each other with respect to Subject Taxes satisfied by the funds in the escrow account (the “Escrow Funds”), notwithstanding the indemnification provisions of the Tax Allocation Agreement. To the extent that the Escrow
Funds are insufficient to satisfy all liabilities for Subject Taxes that are finally determined to be due (such excess amount, “Excess Taxes”), the relative liability of Kindred and the Company to pay such Excess Taxes shall be determined
as provided in the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement. Disputes under the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement, and the determination of the relative liability of Kindred and the Company to pay Excess Taxes, if any, are governed by the arbitration provision of the
Tax Allocation Agreement.

Interest earned on the
Escrow Funds or included in refund amounts received from governmental authorities is distributed equally to each of Kindred and the Company on an annual basis and are accrued as interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Any Escrow
Funds remaining in the escrow account after no further claims may be made by governmental authorities with respect to Subject Taxes or Subject Refunds (because of the expiration of statutes of limitation or otherwise) will be distributed equally to
Kindred and the Company. At December 31, 2002, approximately $14.4 million of disputed Subject Refunds and accrued interest, representing 50% of the Escrow Funds, is recognized in restricted cash and other liabilities on the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Agreement of
Indemnity—Third Party Leases

In
connection with the 1998 Spin Off, the Company assigned its former third party lease obligations (i.e., leases under which an unrelated third party is the landlord) as a tenant or as a guarantor of tenant obligations to Kindred (the “Third
Party Leases”). The lessors of these properties may claim that the Company remains liable on the Third Party Leases assigned to Kindred. Under the terms of the Agreement of Indemnity—Third Party Leases, Kindred and its subsidiaries have
agreed to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and against all claims against the Company arising out of the Third Party Leases assigned by the Company to Kindred. Either prior to or following the 1998 Spin Off, the tenant’s rights
under a subset of the Third Party Leases were assigned or sublet to third parties unrelated to Kindred (the “Subleased Third Party Leases”). If Kindred or such third party subtenants are unable to or do not satisfy the obligations under
any Third Party Lease assigned by the Company to Kindred, and if the lessors prevail in a claim against the Company under the Third Party Leases, then the Company may be liable for the payment and performance of the obligations under any such Third
Party Lease. The Company believes it may have valid legal defenses to any such claim by certain lessors under the Third Party Leases. However, there can be no assurance the Company would prevail in a claim brought by a lessor under a Third Party
Lease. In the event that a lessor should prevail in a claim against the Company, the Company may be entitled to receive revenues from those properties that would mitigate the costs incurred in connection with the satisfaction of such obligations.
The Third Party Leases relating to nursing facilities, hospitals, offices and warehouses have remaining terms (excluding renewal periods) of 1 to 10 years. The Third Party Leases relating to ground leases have remaining terms from 1 to 80 years.
Under the Kindred Reorganization Plan, Kindred assumed and has agreed to fulfill its obligations under the Agreement of Indemnity—Third Party Leases. There can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to
financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Agreement of Indemnity—Third Party Leases

F-29


or that Kindred will continue to honor its obligations under the Agreement of Indemnity—Third Party Leases. If Kindred does not satisfy
or otherwise honor the obligations under the Agreement of Indemnity—Third Party Leases, then the Company may be liable for the payment and performance of such obligations. Under the Kindred Reorganization Plan, Kindred has agreed not to renew
or extend any Third Party Lease unless it first obtains a release of the Company from liability under such Third Party Lease.

The total aggregate remaining minimum rental payments under the Third Party Leases are as follows (in thousands):

Agreement of Indemnity—Third Party Contracts

In connection with the 1998 Spin Off, the Company assigned its former third party guaranty agreements to Kindred (the “Third Party Guarantees”). The Company may remain liable on the Third Party Guarantees assigned
to Kindred. Under the terms of the Agreement of Indemnity—Third Party Contracts, Kindred and its subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and against all claims against the Company arising out of the Third Party
Guarantees assigned by the Company to Kindred. If Kindred is unable to or does not satisfy the obligations under any Third Party Guarantee assigned by the Company to Kindred, then the Company may be liable for the payment and performance of the
obligations under any such agreement.

The Third
Party Guarantees were entered into in connection with certain acquisitions and financing transactions. Under the Kindred Reorganization Plan, Kindred assumed and has agreed to fulfill its obligations under the Agreement of Indemnity—Third Party
Contracts. There can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations incurred in connection with the Agreement of Indemnity—Third Party Contracts or that Kindred
will continue to honor its obligations under the Agreement of Indemnity—Third Party Contracts. If Kindred does not satisfy or otherwise honor the obligations under the Agreement of Indemnity—Third Party Contracts, then the Company may be
liable for the payment and performance of such obligations. The Company believes that it has no material exposure under these Third Party Guarantees.

Assumption of Certain Operating Liabilities and Litigation

In connection with the 1998 Spin Off, Kindred agreed in various agreements (the “Spin Agreements”)
to, among other things, assume and to indemnify the Company for any and all liabilities that may arise out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations either before or after the date of the 1998 Spin Off. The indemnification provided
by Kindred also covers losses, including costs and expenses, which may arise from any future claims asserted against the Company based on these healthcare operations. In addition, at the time of the 1998 Spin Off, Kindred agreed to assume the
defense, on behalf of the Company, of any claims that were pending at the time of the 1998 Spin Off, and which arose out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations. Kindred also agreed to defend, on behalf of the Company, any claims
asserted after the 1998 Spin Off which arise out of the ownership and operation of the healthcare operations. Under the Kindred Reorganization Plan, Kindred assumed and agreed to perform its obligations under these indemnifications. There can be no
assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations incurred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off or that Kindred will continue to honor its obligations

F-30


incurred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off. If Kindred does not satisfy or otherwise honor the obligations under these arrangements, then
the Company may be liable for the payment and performance of such obligations and may have to assume the defense of such claims.

Kindred Common Stock and Registration Rights Agreement

On the Kindred Effective Date, Ventas Realty received 1,498,500 shares of the common stock in Kindred Common
Stock, representing not more than 9.99% of the issued and outstanding common stock in Kindred as of the Kindred Effective Date. Based on applicable laws, regulations, advice from experts, an appraisal, the trading performance of Kindred common stock
at the time and other appropriate facts and circumstances, the illiquidity and lack of registration of the Kindred Common Stock when received and the Company’s lack of significant influence over Kindred, the Company determined the value of the
Kindred Common Stock was $18.2 million on the date received by Ventas Realty. The Kindred Common Stock received by Ventas Realty is subject to dilution from stock issuances occurring after the Kindred Effective Date. The Kindred Common Stock was
issued to the Company as additional future rent in consideration of the Company’s agreement to charge the base rent as provided in the Kindred Master Leases.

On the Kindred Effective Date, Kindred executed and delivered to Ventas Realty and other signatories, a
Registration Rights Agreement, which, among other things, provides that Kindred must file a shelf registration statement with respect to the Kindred Common Stock and keep such registration statement continuously effective for a period of two years
with respect to such securities (subject to customary exceptions). The shelf registration statement was declared effective on November 7, 2001.

The Company disposed of 418,186 shares of Kindred Common Stock in the fourth quarter of 2001 and recognized a gain of $15.4 million on the
dispositions. In connection with a registered offering of common stock by Kindred, Ventas Realty exercised its piggyback registration rights, and sold 83,300 shares of Kindred Common Stock, recognizing a gain of $2.6 million. The Company applied the
net proceeds of $3.6 million from the sale of the 83,300 shares of Kindred Common Stock as a prepayment on the Company’s indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement. The Company distributed 334,886 shares of Kindred Common Stock as part of the
2001 dividend, resulting in a gain of $12.8 million. For every share of common stock of the Company that a stockholder owned at the close of business on December 14, 2001, the stockholder received 0.005 of a share of Kindred common stock and $0.0049
in cash (equating to one share of Kindred common stock and $0.98 in cash for every two hundred shares of common stock in the Company). For purposes of the 2001 dividend, the Kindred Common Stock was valued in accordance with the Code and applicable
rulings and regulations on December 31, 2001 at $51.02 per share (the average of the high and low price on that day).

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company disposed of a total of 159,500 shares of Kindred Common Stock for an average net
price of $43.39 per share and recognized a gain of $5.0 million. The Company applied net proceeds of $6.9 million as a prepayment of the Company’s indebtedness under the 2002 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2002, the Company owned 920,814
shares of Kindred Common Stock. As a result of Kindred’s announcement relating to the Florida skilled nursing facilities and other events, the market value of the Company’s Kindred Common Stock has declined substantially to approximately
$16.7 million, or $18.15 per share, as of December 31, 2002.

Settlement of United States Claims

Kindred and the Company were the subject of investigations by the United States Department of Justice regarding the Company’s prior healthcare operations, including matters arising from lawsuits filed under the qui tam, or
whistleblower, provision of the Federal Civil False Claims Act, which allows private citizens to bring a suit in the name of the United States. See “Note 14—Litigation.” The Kindred Reorganization Plan contains a comprehensive
settlement of all of these claims by the United States (the “United States Settlement”).

F-31


Under the
United States Settlement, the Company is required to pay $103.6 million to the United States, of which $34.0 million was paid on the Kindred Effective Date. The balance of $69.6 million bears interest at 6% per annum and is payable in equal
quarterly installments over a five-year term commencing on June 30, 2001 and ending in 2006. The Company also paid approximately $0.4 million to legal counsel for the relators in the qui tam actions. In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company
recorded the full amount of the obligation under the United States Settlement for $96.5 million based on an imputed interest rate of 10.75%.

Note 12—Commitments and Contingencies

The Company may be subject to certain liabilities assumed by Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off. See “Note
11—Transactions with Kindred.”

Note
13—Earnings Per Share

The following
table shows the amounts used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Options
to purchase 2.8 million shares of common stock ranging from $13.13 to $26.0476, were outstanding at December 31, 2002 but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise price was greater than
the average market price of the common shares for the year ended December 31, 2002 and, therefore, the effect would be anti-dilutive. Options to purchase 3.1 million shares of common stock ranging from $10.8125 to $26.0476 were outstanding at
December 31, 2001, but were not

F-32


included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price
of the common shares for the year ended December 31, 2001 and, therefore, the effect would be anti-dilutive. Options to purchase 3.4 million shares of common stock ranging from $5.885 to $26.0476 were outstanding at December 31, 2000, but were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares for the year ended December 31, 2000 and, therefore, the effect would be anti-dilutive.

Note 14—Litigation

Legal Proceedings Presently Defended and Indemnified by
Kindred Under the Spin Agreements

The
following litigation and other matters arose from the Company’s operations prior to the time of the 1998 Spin Off or relate to assets or liabilities transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off. Under the Spin Agreements, Kindred
agreed to assume the defense, on behalf of the Company, of any claims that (a) were pending at the time of the 1998 Spin Off and which arose out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets or liabilities
transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off, or (b) were asserted after the 1998 Spin Off and which arose out of the ownership and operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets or liabilities transferred to Kindred in
connection with the 1998 Spin Off, and to indemnify the Company for any fees, costs, expenses and liabilities arising out of such operations (the “Indemnification”). Kindred is presently defending the Company in the matters described
below, among others. Pursuant to the Kindred Reorganization Plan, Kindred assumed and agreed to abide by the Indemnification and to defend the Company in these and other matters as required under the Spin Agreements. However, there can be no
assurance that Kindred will continue to defend the Company in such matters or that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy such obligations or its obligations incurred in connection with the 1998
Spin Off. In addition, many of the following descriptions are based primarily on information included in Kindred’s public filings and on information provided to the Company by Kindred. There can be no assurance that Kindred has included in its
public filings and provided the Company complete and accurate information in all instances.

A class action lawsuit entitled

A. Carl Helwig v. Vencor, Inc. et al.

was filed on December 24, 1997 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky (Civil Action No.
3-97CV-8354). The putative class action claims were brought by an alleged stockholder of the Company against the Company and certain executive officers and directors of the Company. The complaint alleged that the Company and certain current and
former executive officers of the Company during a specified time period violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, by, among other things, issuing to the investing public a series of false and misleading statements concerning the
Company’s current operations and the inherent value of the Company’s Common Stock. The complaint further alleged that as a result of these purported false and misleading statements concerning the Company’s revenues and acquisitions,
the price of the Company’s Common Stock was artificially inflated. This case was settled and dismissed with prejudice pursuant to the Order and Final Judgment of the District Court entered on May 16, 2002. The Company did not pay any amount in
connection with the settlement.

A stockholder
derivative suit entitled

Thomas G. White on behalf of Kindred, Inc. and Ventas, Inc. v. W. Bruce Lunsford, et al

., Case No. 98 C103669 was filed in June 1998 in the Jefferson County, Kentucky, Circuit Court. The Complaint alleges,
among other things, that the defendants damaged Kindred and the Company by engaging in violations of the securities laws, including engaging in insider trading, fraud and securities fraud and damaging the reputation of Kindred and the Company. The
suit seeks unspecified damages, interest, punitive damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees and other costs, and any extraordinary equitable and/or injunctive relief permitted by law or equity to assure the plaintiff has an
effective remedy. The Company believes the allegations in the Complaint are without merit. On October 4, 2002, Kindred filed with the Court a motion to dismiss this action as to all defendants, including the Company, for lack of prosecution by the
plaintiffs. On October 17, 2002, the Court granted Kindred’s motion to dismiss with prejudice. On October 17, 2002, the plaintiffs filed with the Court a motion to vacate that order of dismissal in order to allow further briefing. Kindred, on
behalf of the Company, intends to continue to defend this action vigorously.

F-33


A class action
lawsuit entitled

Sally Pratt, et al. v. Ventas, Inc. et al.

was filed on May 25, 2001 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky (Civil Action No. 3-01CV-317-H). The putative class action complaint alleges that
the Company and certain current and former officers and employees of the Company engaged in a fraudulent scheme to conceal the true nature and substance of the 1998 Spin Off resulting in (a) a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, (b) bankruptcy fraud, (c) common law fraud, and (d) a deprivation of plaintiffs’ civil rights. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants failed to act affirmatively to explain and disclose the fact that the Company was
the entity that had been known as Vencor, Inc. prior to the 1998 Spin Off and that a new separate and distinct legal entity assumed the name of Vencor, Inc. after the 1998 Spin Off. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants filed misleading
documents in the plaintiffs’ state court lawsuits that were pending at the time of the 1998 Spin Off and that the defendants deceptively used the Delaware bankruptcy proceedings of Vencor, Inc. (now known as Kindred Healthcare, Inc.) to stay
lawsuits against the Company. As a result of these actions, the plaintiffs maintain that they and similarly situated individuals suffered and will continue to suffer severe financial harm. The suit seeks compensatory damages (trebled with interest),
actual and punitive damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses, declaratory and injunctive and any and all other relief to which the plaintiffs may be entitled. Before any class of plaintiffs was certified, this action was
dismissed in its entirety on February 4, 2002 because it was deemed to be an impermissible collateral attack on the Delaware Bankruptcy Court’s confirmation order. The plaintiffs thereafter filed an appeal of the District Court’s dismissal
to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. However, on plaintiffs’ motion, the appeal was stayed after the plaintiffs separately filed a motion with the Delaware Bankruptcy Court seeking, among other things, to have the
Delaware Bankruptcy Court set aside portions of the releases of the Company contained in the Kindred Reorganization Plan, as such releases might apply to the plaintiffs. On September 19, 2002, the Delaware Bankruptcy Court denied the
plaintiffs’ motion. The Sixth Circuit appeal has been resumed by the plaintiffs. Kindred, on behalf of the Company, intends to contest the Sixth Circuit appeal vigorously.

Kindred is a party to certain legal actions and regulatory investigations arising in the normal course of its
business. The Company is a party to certain legal actions and regulatory investigations that arise from the normal course of its prior healthcare operations, which legal actions and regulatory investigations are being defended by Kindred under the
Indemnification. Neither the Company nor Kindred is able to predict the ultimate outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(“CMS”) or other regulatory agencies will not initiate additional investigations related to Kindred’s business or the Company’s prior healthcare business in the future, nor can there be any assurance that the resolution of any
litigation or investigations, either individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on Kindred’s liquidity, financial position or results of operations, which in turn could have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

Other Litigation

The Company and Atria, Inc.
(“Atria”) have been engaged in ongoing discussions regarding the parties’ respective rights and obligations relative to the issuance of mortgage resident bonds (the “Bonds”) to the new residents of New Pond Village, a senior
housing facility in Walpole, Massachusetts, owned by the Company and leased to and operated by Atria. On August 6, 2001, Atria filed a lawsuit styled

Atria, Inc. v. Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership

in the Superior Court Department of the
Trial Court in Norfolk County, Massachusetts (Civil Action Number 01 01233). The complaint alleged that the Company had a duty to sign and issue Bonds to new residents of New Pond Village and that, as a result of an alleged failure of the Company to
issue Bonds, the Company has, among other things, breached contractual obligations under the Bond Indenture. This case was settled and dismissed with prejudice pursuant to the Order and Final Judgment of the District Court entered on January 7,
2003. Ventas was not required to pay any amounts in connection with the settlement.

The Company is a plaintiff in an action seeking a declaratory judgment and damages entitled

Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership et al. v. Black Diamond CLO 1998-1 Ltd., et al.,

Case No.
99C107076, filed November 22, 1999 in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Kentucky. Two of the three defendants in that action, Black

F-34


Diamond International Funding, Ltd. and BDC Finance, LLC (collectively “Black Diamond”), have asserted counterclaims against the
Company under theories of breach of contract, tortious interference with contract and abuse of process. The Company disputes the material allegations contained in Black Diamond’s counterclaims and the Company intends to continue to pursue its
claims and defend the counterclaims vigorously.

The Company is party to various lawsuits arising in the normal course of the Company’s business. It is the opinion of management that, except as set forth in this Note 14, the disposition of these lawsuits will not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. If management’s assessment of the Company’s liability with respect to these actions is incorrect, such lawsuits could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

No provision for liability, if any, resulting
from the aforementioned litigation has been made in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2002.

Note 15—Capital Stock

The authorized capital stock of the Company at December 31, 2002 and 2001 consisted of 180,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value
of $.25 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock of which 300,000 shares have been designated Series A Participating Preferred Stock.

On June 19, 2002, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Commission relating to $750 million of
common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares and warrants. The registration statement became effective on July 8, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, $651 million of these securities remained available for offering off the shelf
registration statement.

During the fourth
quarter ended December 31, 2002, the Company commenced and completed an equity offering of the Company’s common stock with Tenet Healthcare Corporation (“Tenet”). The Equity Offering consisted of 9,000,000 newly issued shares of
common stock sold by Ventas and 8,301,067 shares of Ventas common stock owned and sold by Tenet, all priced at $11.00 per share. The net proceeds received by Ventas from its sale of its newly issued common stock were $93.6 million and were used to
repay outstanding indebtedness including the indebtedness incurred by the Company to invest in the THI Transaction.

Excess Share Provision

In order to preserve the Company’s ability to maintain REIT status, the Company’s certificate of incorporation provides that if
a person acquires beneficial ownership of greater than 9% of the outstanding stock of the Company, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of such 9% limit are deemed to be “Excess Shares.” Excess Shares are automatically deemed
transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. The trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the Excess Shares and the trustee may
exercise all voting power over the Excess Shares.

The Company has the right to buy the Excess Shares for a purchase price equal to the lesser of (1) the price per share in the transaction that created the Excess Shares, or (2) the market price on the date the Company buys the
shares. The Company has the right to defer payment of the purchase price for the Excess Shares for up to five years. If the Company does not purchase the Excess Shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the Excess Shares at the
direction of the Board of Directors. The owner of the Excess Shares is entitled to receive the lesser of the proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares or the original purchase price for such Excess Shares; any additional amounts are payable to the
beneficiary of the trust.

Under the
Company’s certificate of incorporation, certain holders (“Existing Holders”) who owned the Company’s common stock in excess of the foregoing limits on the date of the 1998 Spin Off, are not subject to the general ownership limits
applicable to other stockholders. Existing Holders are generally permitted to own up

F-35


to the same percentage of the Company’s common stock that was owned on the date of the 1998 Spin Off, provided such ownership does not
jeopardize the Company’s status as a REIT. Until the fourth quarter of 2002, Tenet Healthcare Corporation (“Tenet”) had owned approximately 12% of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Stock and, therefore, was treated as
an Existing Holder under the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation. Except as explained below, as an Existing Holder, Tenet was generally permitted to own in excess of the ownership limits in the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation.
During the fourth quarter 2002, Tenet sold all of its 8,301,067 shares of Ventas common stock and is no longer deemed an Existing Holder.

The Company’s Board of Directors is empowered to grant waivers from the “Excess Share” provisions of the Company’s
Certificate of Incorporation. On October 14, 2002, the Company granted such a waiver (the “C&S Waiver”) from the 9% ownership limitation provisions of Article XII of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to Cohen & Steers
Capital Management, Inc. (“C&S”). Under the C&S Waiver, C&S may beneficially own, in the aggregate, up to 12.50%, in number of shares or value, of the Common Stock.

Preferred Stock Purchase Rights

The Company has issued Preferred Stock Purchase Rights (the “Rights”) pursuant to the terms of the
Rights Agreement, dated July 20, 1993, as amended, with National City Bank as Rights Agent (the “Rights Agreement”). Under the terms of the Rights Agreement, the Company declared a dividend of one Right for each outstanding share of Common
Stock of the Company to common stockholders of record on August 1, 1993. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company one-hundredth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $110. A total of 300,000 shares of
Series A Preferred Stock are subject to the Rights.

The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects and are intended to cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company without conditioning the offer on the Rights being redeemed or a substantial
number of the Rights being acquired.

Under the
terms of the Rights Agreement, if at such time as any person becomes the beneficial owner of 9.9% or more of the Common Stock (an “Acquiring Person”), (i) the Company is involved in a merger or other business combination in which the
Common Stock is exchanged or changed (other than a merger with a person or group which both (a) acquired Common Stock pursuant to a Permitted Offer (as defined below) and (b) is offering not less than the price paid pursuant to the Permitted Offer
and the same form of consideration paid in the Permitted Offer) or (ii) 50% or more of the Company’s assets or earning power are sold, the Rights become exercisable for that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the
time of such transaction would have a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right (such right being called the “Flip-over”). A “Permitted Offer” is a tender or exchange offer which is for all outstanding shares of
Common Stock at a price and on terms determined, prior to the purchase of shares under such tender or exchange offer, by at least a majority of the members of the Board of Directors who are not officers of the Company and who are not Acquiring
Persons or affiliates, associates, nominees or representatives of an Acquiring Person, to be adequate and otherwise in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders (other than the person or any affiliate or associate thereof on whose
behalf the offer is being made) taking into account all factors that such directors deem relevant.

In the event any person becomes an Acquiring Person, for a 60 day period after such event, if the Flip-over right is not also triggered,
the Rights become exercisable for that number of shares of Common Stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right, to the extent available, and then (after all authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock have been
issued), a common stock equivalent having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.

Upon any person becoming an Acquiring Person (other than pursuant to a Permitted Offer), any rights issued to or beneficially owned by
such Acquiring Person become null and void and thereafter may not be transferred to any other person.

F-36


Certain
persons and transactions are exempted from the operation of the Rights. Prior to a person becoming an Acquiring Person, the Board has the power to amend the Rights Agreement or cause the redemption of the Rights, at a purchase price of $0.01 in cash
per Right. After the time a person becomes an Acquiring Person, the Board can only amend the Rights Agreement to make changes that do not adversely affect the interests of the holders of Rights. For purposes of the Rights Agreement a person is not
deemed to be the beneficial owner of securities designated as Excess Shares under the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation.

DRIP

The Company’s Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the “Plan” or “DRIP”) was declared effective by
the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 31, 2001. Under the Plan’s terms, existing stockholders may purchase shares of common stock in the Company by reinvesting all or a portion of the cash distribution on their shares of the
Company’s common stock. In addition, existing stockholders of the Company, as well as new investors may purchase shares of common stock in the Company by making optional cash payments.

Note 16—Related Party Transactions

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had receivables of
approximately $4.1 million and $3.6 million, respectively, due from certain current and former executive officers of the Company. The loans include interest provisions (with a 5.0% average rate) and were to finance the income taxes payable by
the executive officers resulting from: (i) the 1998 Spin Off and (ii) vesting of Restricted Shares. The loans are payable over periods ranging from four years to ten years with the majority of the obligations amortizing quarterly. Interest expense
on a note relating to the 1998 Spin Off in the principal amount of $2.3 million at December 31, 2002 (the “1998 Spin Off Note”), is forgiven on a periodic basis, provided that the officer remains an employee of the Company. The payee
of the 1998 Spin Off Note resigned as an employee and director of the Company on January 30, 2003, and will begin paying interest in accordance with the terms of the 1998 Spin Off Note. In the event of a change in control as defined in the
Company’s 1997 Incentive Compensation Plan, accrued interest on and the principal balance of the 1998 Spin Off Note is forgiven. Interest expense on the note relating to taxes paid for the vested portion of Restricted Shares (the
“Restricted Share Note”) is payable annually out of and only to the extent of dividends from the vested restricted shares. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the relevant employment agreement) or upon
termination of the officer without cause (as defined in the relevant employment agreement), the principal balance of the Restricted Share Note is forgiven. The Restricted Share Note is secured by a pledge of all of the restricted shares to which the
Restricted Share Note relates and the Restricted Share Note is otherwise non-recourse. The 1998 Spin Off Note is not secured.

On October 15, 1998, the Company acquired eight personal care facilities and related facilities for approximately $7.1 million from
Tangram Rehabilitation Network, Inc. (“Tangram”). Tangram is a wholly owned subsidiary of Res-Care, Inc. (“Res-Care”) of which a director of the Company is the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and another director
of the Company was a member of its board of directors as of December 31, 2002. The Company leases the Tangram facilities to Tangram pursuant to a master lease agreement which is guaranteed by Res-Care. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, Tangram has paid the Company approximately $799,000, $779,000 and $754,000, respectively, in rent payments.
