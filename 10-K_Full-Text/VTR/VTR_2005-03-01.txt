PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

BUSINESS

Overview

We are a healthcare REIT incorporated in Delaware in 1985. We own a
geographically diverse portfolio of healthcare and senior housing facilities which, as of December 31, 2004, consisted of 201 skilled nursing facilities, 40 hospitals, 30 senior housing facilities, and 16 other facilities in 39 states. Except with
respect to our medical office buildings, we lease these facilities to healthcare operating companies under “triple-net” or “absolute-net” leases. As of December 31, 2004, Kindred leased 225 of our facilities. As of December 31,
2004, we also had real estate loan investments relating to 25 healthcare and senior housing facilities.

We operate through one segment, which consists of financing, owning and leasing healthcare-related and senior housing facilities. See our Consolidated
Financial Statements and notes thereto, including “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our business strategy is comprised of two primary objectives: diversifying our portfolio of properties and increasing our
earnings. We intend to continue to diversify our real estate portfolio by operator, facility type and reimbursement source. We intend to invest in or acquire additional healthcare-related and/or senior housing assets across a wide spectrum.

Portfolio of Properties

As of December 31, 2004, we conducted substantially all of our business
through Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership, a wholly owned operating partnership (“Ventas Realty”), Ventas Finance I, LLC, a wholly owned limited liability company (“Ventas Finance”), and ElderTrust Operating Limited Partnership,
an operating partnership in which we own 99.6% of the partnership units (“ETOP”). As of December 31, 2004: Ventas Realty owned 38 of our hospitals, 157 of our skilled nursing facilities and 26 of our senior housing and other facilities;
Ventas Finance owned 39 of our skilled nursing facilities; and ETOP owned five of our skilled nursing facilities, 10 of our senior housing facilities and three other facilities. We and certain of our other subsidiaries owned the remaining nine
facilities.

The following table provides an overview of our
portfolio of healthcare properties and investments as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004:

Healthcare Facilities

Skilled Nursing Facilities

.    Our skilled nursing facilities typically provide nursing care services to the elderly and
rehabilitation and restoration services, including physical, occupational and speech therapies, and other medical treatment for patients and residents who do not require the high technology, care-intensive setting of an acute care or rehabilitation
hospital.

Hospitals

.    Our
hospitals generally are long-term acute care hospitals that serve medically complex, chronically ill patients who require a high level of monitoring and specialized care, but whose conditions do not necessitate the continued services of an intensive
care unit. The operator of these hospitals has the capability to treat patients who suffer from multiple systemic failures or conditions such as neurological disorders, head injuries, brain stem and spinal cord trauma, cerebral vascular accidents,
chemical brain injuries, central nervous system disorders, developmental anomalies and cardiopulmonary disorders. Chronic patients are often dependent on technology for continued life support, such as mechanical ventilators, total parenteral
nutrition, respiration or cardiac monitors and dialysis machines, and, therefore, due to their severe medical conditions, these patients generally are not clinically appropriate for admission to a nursing facility or rehabilitation hospital. Our one
29-bed rehabilitation hospital provides high intensity physical, respiratory, neurological, orthopedic and other treatment protocols for patients during recovery.

Senior Housing Facilities

.    Our assisted and independent living facilities offer residential
units on a month-to-month basis primarily to elderly individuals with various levels of assistance requirements. Residents of these facilities are provided meals in a central dining area and engage in group activities organized by the staff.
Assisted living residents may also be provided personal supervision and daily assistance with eating, bathing, grooming and administering medication that make it possible for them to live independently.

Other Facilities

.    Our other facilities consist
of medical office buildings, which offer office space primarily to physicians and other healthcare-related businesses, and personal care facilities, which provide specialized care, including supported living services, neurorehabilitation,
neurobehavioral management and vocational programs, for persons with acquired or traumatic brain injury.

Other Real Estate Investments

Our THI Mezzanine Loan is secured by equity pledges in entities that own and operate 17 healthcare properties plus liens on four other healthcare
properties and interests in three additional properties and a physical therapy business. See “Note 6—Mergers and Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.



Index to Financial Statements

Geographic Diversification

.    Our portfolio is broadly diversified by
geographic location, with facilities in one state comprising more than 10% percent of our 2004 total revenues. The following table shows our rental income derived by geographic location for the year ended December 31, 2004:

(a)

Includes (i) revenue of $2.3 million related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of our receipt of Kindred common stock and the amortization of the deferred
revenue recorded from the receipt of $4.5 million of additional future rent under our leases with Kindred and (ii) $0.1 million from subleases under our leases with Kindred.

(b)

The remainder of our total revenues is interest from a loan receivable and interest and other income.

Certificates of Need

As a result of the geographic diversification of our portfolio, a majority of our skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are located in states that have
certificate of need (“CON”) requirements. A CON, which is issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities, is at times required for expansion of existing facilities, construction of new facilities, addition of
beds, acquisition of major items of equipment or introduction of new services. The CON rules and regulations may restrict an operator’s ability to expand our properties in certain circumstances.

The following table shows the percentage of our revenues derived by skilled
nursing facilities and hospitals in states with and without CON requirements for the year ended December 31, 2004:

Dependence on Kindred

For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, Kindred
accounted for approximately 81.2% and 93.5%, respectively, of our total revenues. Our reliance on Kindred is a result of the 1998 Spin Off, in which we



Index to Financial Statements

transferred to Kindred our previous hospital, nursing facility and ancillary services businesses and we retained substantially all of the real property which
we leased to Kindred.

Kindred Master Leases

As of December 31, 2004, we leased 225 of our facilities to Kindred
pursuant to our master lease agreements with Kindred (collectively, the “Kindred Master Leases”). Ventas Realty is the lessor under each Kindred Master Lease, except for the Kindred Master Lease entered into with Ventas Finance (the
“Kindred CMBS Master Lease”).

Each Kindred Master
Lease is a “triple-net lease” pursuant to which Kindred is required to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance and repairs related to the properties.

Under each Kindred Master Lease, the aggregate annual rent is referred to as Base Rent (as defined in the applicable Kindred
Master Lease). Base Rent escalates on May 1 of each year at an annual rate of 3.5% over the Prior Period Base Rent (as defined in the applicable Kindred Master Lease) if certain Kindred revenue parameters are met. Assuming such Kindred revenue
parameters are met, Base Rent due under the Kindred Master Leases will be $198.9 million from May 1, 2005 to April 30, 2006. See “Note 3—Revenues from Properties” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,
Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The properties
leased to Kindred pursuant to each Kindred Master Lease are grouped into bundles, with each bundle containing a varying number of properties. All properties within a bundle have primary terms ranging from 10 to 15 years, commencing May 1, 1998, plus
renewal options totaling 15 years. Properties are renewable only in bundles.

We have a one-time right under each Kindred Master Lease (the “Reset Right”), exercisable by notice given on or after January 20, 2006 and on or before July 19, 2007, to increase the rent to a then fair
market rental rate, commencing as early as July 19, 2006, for a total fee of $4.6 million payable on a pro-rata basis at the time of exercise under the applicable Kindred Master Lease. The Reset Right generally applies on a lease-by-lease basis,
except that the Reset Rights under Master Lease No. 1, Master Lease No. 1A and the Kindred CMBS Master Lease can only be exercised together. If the Reset Right is exercised for any Kindred Master Lease, the annual escalations currently applicable to
that lease may be altered or reduced, depending on market conditions at the time. We believe that, based on information currently available to us and current market conditions, if we were entitled to and did exercise the Reset Right, the rent under
the Kindred Master Leases would increase, perhaps materially. However, the value of the Reset Right is dependent on a variety of factors and is highly speculative and there can be no assurances regarding the value of the Reset Right. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Arising from Our Business—We are dependent on Kindred; Kindred’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness
and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT.”

Recent Developments

From January 1, 2005 through February 28, 2005, we have invested an additional $49.0 million in healthcare and senior housing assets. The initial cash
yield on these investments exceeds 9.0%. The investments consist of an acute care hospital, one assisted living facility, three medical office buildings and a first mortgage loan.

Competition

We compete for real property investments with healthcare providers, other healthcare-related REITs, healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks,
insurance companies and other investors. Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources and lower cost of capital than we do. Our



Index to Financial Statements

ability to continue to compete successfully for real property investments will be determined by numerous factors, including our ability to identify suitable
acquisition or investment targets, our ability to negotiate acceptable terms for any such acquisition and the availability and cost of capital to us. See “Risk Factors—Risks Arising from Our Business—We may encounter certain risks
when implementing our business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional healthcare-related and/or senior housing assets” and “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with other healthcare operators. Their ability to compete successfully for patients at our facilities depends upon several factors, including the
quality of care at the facility, the scope of services provided, the operational reputation of the operator, physician referral patterns, physical appearance of the facilities, other competitive systems of healthcare delivery within the community,
population and demographics, and the financial condition of the operator. Private, federal and state reimbursement programs and the effect of other laws and regulations also may have a significant impact on our operators’ ability to compete
successfully for patients at the properties. See “Risk Factors—Risks Arising from Our Business—Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have
a material adverse effect on our tenants.”

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, we had 24 full-time employees and one part-time
employee. We consider the relationship with our employees to be good.

Insurance

We maintain and/or require in our
existing leases that our tenants maintain liability and casualty insurance on the properties and their operations. Under the Kindred Master Leases, Kindred is required to maintain, at its expense, certain insurance coverage related to the properties
under the Kindred Master Leases and Kindred’s operations at the related facilities. See “—Dependence on Kindred—Kindred Master Leases.” However, we cannot assure you that Kindred and our other tenants will maintain such
insurance, and any failure by Kindred or our other tenants to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity, on our ability to service our indebtedness and on our ability to make
distributions to our stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT (a “Material Adverse Effect”). We believe that Kindred and our other tenants are in substantial compliance with the insurance requirements contained in their
respective leases with us.

We believe that the amount and
scope of insurance coverage provided by our own and our tenants’ policies is customary for similarly situated companies in our industry. We cannot assure you that in the future such insurance will be available at a reasonable price or that we
will be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance coverage.

Due to the increase in the number and severity of professional liability claims against healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has been severely restricted and the premiums for such insurance coverage has
increased dramatically. As a result, many healthcare providers may incur large funded and unfunded professional liability expense, which could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, many healthcare providers are pursuing different organizational and corporate structures coupled with insurance programs that provide less insurance coverage. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our tenants will continue to carry the
insurance coverage required under the terms of their leases with us or that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under our leases.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Healthcare Regulation

General

The operators of our properties derive a substantial portion of their revenues from third party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, certain disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a medical assistance program jointly funded by
federal and state governments and administered by each state pursuant to which benefits are available to certain indigent patients. The Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework is subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion
that affect the amount and timing of reimbursement made under Medicare and Medicaid. The amounts of program payments received by our operators and tenants can be changed by legislative or regulatory actions and by determinations by agents for the
programs. See “—Healthcare Reform.” In addition, private payors, including managed care payors, increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk.
Efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon operators by private payors are expected to continue. We cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be available for services to be provided by the
operators of our properties which currently are being reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and private payors. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on these
operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments to us.

The operators of our properties are subject to other extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to, laws and
regulations relating to licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities, services, prices for services, billing for services, and the confidentiality and security of health-related information. These laws authorize
periodic inspections and investigations, and identification of deficiencies that, if not corrected, can result in sanctions that include loss of licensure to operate and loss of rights to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Regulatory
agencies have substantial powers to affect the actions of operators of our properties if the agencies believe that there is an imminent threat to patient welfare, and in some states these powers can include assumption of interim control over
facilities through receiverships.

Certificates of Need

Some states require state approval for development and
expansion of healthcare facilities and services, including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. A CON is issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities and is at times required
for expansion of existing facilities, construction of new facilities, addition of beds, and acquisition of major items of equipment or introduction of new services. The CON rules and regulations may restrict an operator’s ability to expand our
properties in certain circumstances.

In the last several
years, in response to mounting Medicaid budget deficits, many states have begun to tighten CON controls, including the imposition of moratoriums on new nursing facilities and hospitals. Some states have also increased controls over licensing and
change-of-ownership rules.



Index to Financial Statements

In the event that any operator of our properties fails to make rental payments to us or to comply with
the applicable healthcare regulations, and, in either case, the operator or its lenders fail to cure the default prior to the expiration of the applicable cure period, our ability to evict that operator and substitute another operator or operators
may be materially delayed or limited by various state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules. Such delays and limitations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
collect rent, to obtain possession of leased properties, or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant default. In addition, we may also incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any such licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership
proceedings.

Fraud and Abuse

There are extensive federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting fraud
and abuse in the healthcare industry that can result in significant criminal and civil penalties that can materially affect the operators of our properties. The federal laws include:

•

The anti-kickback statute (Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act), which prohibits certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of
healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by Medicare or other governmental programs.

•

The physician self-referral prohibition (Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the “Stark Law”), which prohibits referrals by physicians of
Medicare patients to providers of a broad range of designated healthcare services with which the physicians (or their immediate family members) or Medicaid have ownership interests or certain other financial arrangements.

•

The False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government (including the Medicare and Medicaid
programs).

•

The Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which authorizes the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to impose civil penalties administratively for
fraudulent acts.

•

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (commonly referred to as “HIPAA”), which among other things, protects the privacy and security of
individually identifiable health information by limiting its use and disclosure.

Sanctions for violating these federal laws include criminal and civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, money penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, and/or
exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These laws also impose an affirmative duty on operators to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the Medicare and other government programs.

Many states have adopted or are considering legislative proposals similar to
the federal fraud and abuse laws, some of which extend beyond the Medicare and Medicaid programs to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self-referrals regardless of whether the service was
reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid. Many states have also adopted or are considering legislative proposals to increase patient protections, such as minimum staffing levels, criminal background checks, and limiting the use and disclosure of patient
specific health information. These state laws also impose criminal and civil penalties similar to the federal laws.

In the ordinary course of their business, the operators of our properties have been and are subject regularly to inquiries, investigations and audits by
federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. Recent federal and state legislation has greatly increased funding for investigations and enforcement actions which have increased dramatically over the past several years. This
trend is expected to continue. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud also has increased due in large part to amendments to the civil False Claims Act



Index to Financial Statements

in 1986 that were designed to encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits by private individuals, known as
qui tam relators, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former patients or nurses and other employees. HIPAA also created a series of new healthcare related crimes.

As federal and state budget pressures continue, federal and state administrative agencies may also continue to escalate
investigation and enforcement efforts to root out waste and to control fraud and abuse in governmental healthcare programs. A violation of any of these federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on
our operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments to us.

Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals

Substantially all of our hospitals are operated as long-term acute care hospitals (“LTACs”), which are hospitals that have a Medicare average
length of stay greater than 25 days. Our hospitals are freestanding facilities and we do not own any “hospitals within hospitals.” In order to receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, each hospital must meet the applicable conditions
of participation set forth by HHS relating to the type of hospital, its equipment, personnel and standard of medical care, as well as comply with state and local laws and regulations. Hospitals undergo periodic on-site licensure surveys, which
generally are limited if the hospital is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (“JCAHO”) or other recognized accreditation organizations. A loss of licensure or certification could adversely affect
a hospital’s ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could in turn adversely impact the operator’s ability to make rental payments under its leases with us.

Skilled Nursing Facilities

The operators of our skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”) generally
are licensed on an annual or bi-annual basis and certified annually for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs through various regulatory agencies which determine compliance with federal, state and local laws. These legal requirements
relate to the quality of the nursing care provided, qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff, the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment and continuing compliance with the laws and regulations governing the operation of
nursing facilities. A loss of licensure or certification could adversely affect a nursing facility’s ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could in turn adversely impact the operator’s ability to make
rental payments under its leases with us.

Assisted Living
Facilities

Assisted living facilities (“ALFs”)
provide services to aid in activities of daily living, such as bathing, meals, security, transportation, recreation, medication supervision and limited therapeutic programs. More intensive medical needs of the resident are often met within ALFs by
home health providers, close coordination with the resident’s physician and skilled nursing facilities. ALFs are subject to relatively few federal regulations. Instead, they are regulated mainly by state and local laws which govern the
licensing of beds, the provision of services, staffing requirements and other operational matters. However, these state laws vary greatly from one state to another.

The recent increase in the number of ALFs around the country has attracted the attention of various federal agencies which
believe there should be more federal regulation of ALFs. So far Congress has deferred to state regulation of ALFs. As a result of the increased federal scrutiny along with the rapid increase in the number of ALFs, some states have revised and
strengthened their regulation of ALFs. More states are expected to do the same in the future.



Index to Financial Statements

Any significant expansion in the number or type of, or a violation of any of, these federal, state or
local laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments to us.

Healthcare Reform

Healthcare is one of the largest industries in the United States and
continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention. In an effort to reduce federal spending on healthcare, in 1997 the federal government enacted the Balanced Budget Act (“BBA”), which contained extensive changes to the
Medicare and Medicaid programs, including substantial reimbursement reductions for healthcare operations. For certain healthcare providers, including hospitals and SNFs, implementation of the BBA resulted in more drastic reimbursement reductions
than had been anticipated. In addition to its impact on Medicare, the BBA also afforded states more flexibility in administering their Medicaid plans, including the ability to shift most Medicaid enrollees into managed care plans without first
obtaining a federal waiver.

The following key legislative and
regulatory changes have been made to the BBA to provide some relief from the drastic reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement resulting from implementation of the BBA:

•

The Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (“BBRA”);

•

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“Medicare Modernization Act”, sometimes referred to as the “Drug Bill”).

For the last several years, many states have
announced actual or potential budget shortfalls. As a result of these budget shortfalls, many states have announced that they are implementing or considering implementing “freezes” or cuts in Medicaid rates paid to providers, including
hospitals and nursing homes.

The Medicare and Medicaid
programs, including payment levels and methods, are in a state of change and are less predictable following the enactment of BBA and the subsequent reform activities. We cannot assure you that future healthcare legislation or changes in the
administration or implementation of governmental healthcare reimbursement programs will not have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition or results of operations of our operators and tenants, which could have a material
adverse effect on their ability to make rental payments and which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Medicare Reimbursement; Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals

The BBA mandated the creation of a prospective payment system for LTACs (“LTAC PPS”), which became effective on October 1, 2002 for LTAC cost
report periods commencing on or after October 1, 2002. LTACs have transitioned or are currently transitioning to LTAC PPS, which classifies patients into distinct diagnostic groups based on clinical characteristics and expected resource needs.

Under LTAC PPS, LTACs are no longer reimbursed on a reasonable
cost basis that reflects costs incurred, but rather on a predetermined rate. LTAC PPS requires payment for a Medicare beneficiary at a predetermined, per discharge amount for each defined patient category (called “Long Term Care—Diagnosis
Related Groups” or “LTC-DRGs”), adjusted for differences in area wage levels.

For LTACs that have filed cost reports before October 1, 2002, a five-year phase-in period has been implemented to gradually transition such LTACs from cost-based reimbursement to 100% federal prospective



Index to Financial Statements

payment under LTAC PPS. At the beginning of any cost reporting period during the phase-in, such LTACs may exercise a one-time, non-revocable election to
transition fully to LTAC PPS rate. Kindred has stated that it has fully transitioned 62 of its 64 LTACs to the LTAC PPS rates.

According to CMS, LTAC PPS is required by law to be “budget neutral,” which means that total payments under LTAC PPS must equal the amount that
would have been paid if the system had not been implemented. As such, budget neutrality adjustments will continue to reduce total Medicare payments made under the system until all facilities have been fully phased-in to the new system.

Updates to the LTAC PPS payment rates are published annually for the LTAC
rate year (July 1 through June 30). However, annual updates to the LTAC PPS classification system and its relative weighting system (LTC-DRGs) will continue to coincide with the federal fiscal year (October 1 to September 30) as with the prospective
payment system for short-term acute care hospitals (DRGs).

On
May 7, 2004, CMS published a final rule updating the LTAC PPS payment rates for the 2005 rate year (July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005). Under this final rule, LTACs received a 3.1% increase in Medicare payments starting July 1, 2004. In the final
rule, CMS further increased LTAC PPS rates by reducing the negative budget neutrality adjustment to 0.5% from 6.0%. The final rule also reduced the threshold for cases to qualify for additional outlier payments, expanded the interrupted stay policy
to include all readmissions within three days to result in only one payment to the LTAC instead of the two payments the LTAC would have received prior to the final rule, and set forth the requirements for satellites and remote locations of long-term
care hospitals to qualify for separate hospital certification.

On August 2, 2004, CMS published a final rule updating the LTC-DRG categorization system for LTAC PPS for the 2005 federal fiscal year (October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005). The final rule revised the relative weights for each
LTC-DRG used to estimate the resource needs of patients classified in each LTC-DRG. The final rule also revised the minimum average length of stay requirements for each LTC-DRG necessary to receive full payment under the system.

On January 28, 2005, CMS issued a proposed rule to update LTAC PPS payment
rates for the 2006 rate year (July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006). Under this proposed rule, LTACs will receive a 3.1% increase in Medicare payments starting July 1, 2005. CMS further proposed reducing the negative budget neutrality adjustment
resulting in a 0.3% increase in LTAC PPS rates starting July 1, 2005. The proposed rule further reduces the threshold for cases to qualify for additional outlier payments. If this rule becomes final, the combined effective increase in fiscal year
2006 Medicare rates for LTACs would be 5.5%.

The proposed rule
also indicates that research is to be conducted to determine the feasibility of implementing the recommendations of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to more clearly define the role of LTACs in the inpatient continuum of care by establishing
facility and patient criteria and for Medicare’s Quality Improvement Organizations to play a larger role in reviewing LTAC admissions for medical necessity and for compliance with any facility and patient criteria. Comments on this rule will be
accepted until March 29, 2005 and a final rule is expected to be published later in the second quarter of 2005.

We cannot assure you that future updates to the LTAC PPS system or Medicare reimbursement for LTACs will not materially and adversely impact our LTAC
operators which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. See “Risk Factors—Risks Arising from Our Business—Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the Medicare and
Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on our tenants.”

Medicare Reimbursement; Skilled Nursing Facilities

BBA established a prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities (“SNF PPS”) offering Part A covered services. Under the SNF PPS, payment amounts are based upon classifications determined through



Index to Financial Statements

assessments of individual Medicare patients in the skilled nursing facility, rather than on the facility’s reasonable costs. The payments received under
the SNF PPS are intended generally to cover all inpatient services for Medicare patients, including routine nursing care, most capital-related costs associated with the inpatient stay, and ancillary services, such as respiratory therapy,
occupational therapy, speech therapy and certain covered drugs. Under the SNF PPS, per diem payments are made to nursing home facilities for each resident.

As a result of SNF PPS, Medicare payments to SNFs dropped by 12.5% in 1999. Although there has been some payment relief (as described below), certain of
the payment relief provisions have expired, and we cannot assure you that the current reimbursement levels under the SNF PPS will continue or be sufficient to permit our operators to satisfy their obligations, including payment of rent under their
leases with us.

In response to widespread healthcare industry
concern about the effects of BBA, the federal government enacted BBRA on November 29, 1999. BBRA increased the per diem reimbursement rates for certain high acuity patients by 20% starting April 1, 2000 and continuing until such time as case-mix
refinements are implemented by CMS. As explained below, CMS has yet to implement case-mix refinements and, therefore, this 20% temporary per diem add-on has been extended and remains in effect. Under BBRA, outpatient rehabilitation therapy providers
received a two-year moratorium on the annual cap on the amount of physical, occupational and speech therapy provided to a patient, which moratorium was subsequently extended until December 31, 2005.

Passed in December 2000, BIPA provided additional relief from the projected
impact of the BBA. BIPA revised the annual market basket update factor upward from “market basket minus 1%” to (a) “market basket” in federal fiscal year 2001, and (b) “market basket minus 0.5%” in federal fiscal years
2002 and 2003. BIPA also increased the per diem reimbursement rates for the rehabilitation-related patient categories by 6.7%, from April 1, 2001 until such time as case-mix refinements are implemented by CMS. As explained below, CMS has yet to
implement case-mix refinement and, therefore, this 6.7% temporary payment increase remains in effect.

In August 2003, CMS administratively corrected the market basket inflation adjustment it used in the implementation of SNF PPS as mandated by the BBA. A
one-time 3.26% increase to the market basket inflation adjustment was made for all SNF PPS payment rates beginning on October 1, 2003. In addition, in December 2003, the Medicare Modernization Act provided that no reductions should be made to the
market basket increases for the SNF PPS rates; therefore 2004 funding was increased by the full market basket of 3%.

During 2003, financial limitations on therapy services went into effect. For Part B nursing facility residents, a $1,500 limit was placed on the
reimbursement level for physical therapy/speech language pathology services combined and a separate $1,500 limit for occupational therapy. As a result of administrative delays and litigation, this limitation was only effective from September 1, 2003
through December 8, 2003, the effective date of the Medicare Modernization Act, which included a two-year moratorium on the application of therapy caps until December 31, 2005.

On July 29, 2004, CMS announced an update to SNF PPS for the 2005 federal fiscal year (October 1, 2004 through September 30,
2005). Starting October 1, 2004, SNFs received a 2.8% increase in Medicare payments. CMS also announced that the two temporary payment increases—the 20% temporary per diem add-on for certain payment categories and the 6.7% temporary payment
increase for other categories, both discussed above—will remain in effect until CMS implements a refined case mix classification system to better account for medically complex patients. Although CMS is actively developing a refined case mix
classification system, at this time it cannot be predicted when such system will be announced and implemented, or what the impact of such system will be on the liquidity or profitability of our tenants.

On February 7, 2005, President Bush released his Fiscal Year 2006 Budget to
Congress. The 2006 budget projects that CMS will refine SNF PPS in 2006 to ensure appropriate payments for certain high-cost cases, sometimes referred to as “RUGS Refinement,” which is assumed under President Bush’s proposed budget to
reduce Medicare payments to SNFs by approximately $1.5 billion dollars in FY 2006 and by $10 billion over the



Index to Financial Statements

next five years. There can be no assurance when RUGS Refinement may be implemented, or if implemented, what impact RUGS Refinement may have on the liquidity
or profitability of our tenants.

There can be no
assurances that updates or proposed changes to the SNF PPS or Medicare reimbursement for SNFs will not materially adversely impact our SNF operators which, and in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. See “Risk Factors—Risks
Arising from Our Business—Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on our tenants.”

Medicaid Reimbursement; Skilled Nursing Facilities

Approximately two-thirds of all nursing home residents are dependent on
Medicaid. Medicaid reimbursement rates, however, typically are less than the amounts charged by the operators of our properties. BBA repealed the “Boren Amendment” federal payment standard for Medicaid payments to hospitals and nursing
facilities effective October 1, 1997, giving states greater latitude in setting payment rates for these providers. Furthermore, federal legislation restricts a nursing facility operator’s ability to withdraw from the Medicaid Program by
restricting the eviction or transfer of Medicaid residents.

For the last several years, many states have announced actual or potential budget shortfalls. As a result of these budget shortfalls, many states have announced that they are implementing or considering implementing “freezes” or
cuts in Medicaid rates paid to SNF providers.

In an effort to
mitigate the state Medicaid budget crisis, the federal Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (“Tax Relief Act”) was enacted on May 28, 2003, which included a $10 billion increase in Medicaid federal funding through federal fiscal
year 2004. In addition, the Tax Relief Act provides an additional $10 billion in state fiscal relief for federal fiscal years 2003 and 2004 to assist states with funding shortfalls. These temporary federal funding provisions were successful in
mitigating state Medicaid funding reductions through mid-calendar year 2004. However, state budget shortfalls continue, fueled in large part by continuing rapid increases in Medicaid spending.

President Bush’s 2006 Budget recommends Congress make changes to the
Medicaid program that are estimated to result in $60 billion in savings to the federal government primarily through the accounting practices some states use to calculate their matched payments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether
significant Medicaid rate freezes or cuts or other program changes will be adopted and if so, by how many states or whether the United States Government will revoke, reduce or stop approving “provider taxes” that have the effect of
increasing Medicaid payments to the states, or the impact of such actions on our operators. However, severe and widespread Medicaid rate cuts or freezes could have a material adverse effect on our SNF operators and, in turn, could have a Material
Adverse Effect on us.

Nursing Home Quality Initiative

In 2002 HHS launched the Nursing Home Quality Initiative
program. This program, which is designed to provide consumers with comparative information about nursing home quality measures, rates nursing homes on various quality of care indicators. Since 2002, investigative and enforcement activities regarding
nursing home quality compliance has intensified both on the federal and state administrative levels.

If the operators of our properties are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or superior to those of their competitors, patients
may choose alternate facilities, which could cause operating revenues to decline. In the event the financial condition or operating revenues of these operators are adversely affected, the operators’ ability to make rental payments to us could
be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Environmental Regulation

As an owner of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental, health and safety
matters. These laws and regulations address, among other things, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, fuel oil management, wastewater discharges, air emissions, radioactive materials, medical wastes, and hazardous wastes. In certain cases, the costs
of complying with these laws and regulations and the penalties for non-compliance can be substantial. For example, although we do not generally operate our properties, we may be held jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the
investigation and cleanup of any property from which there is or has been a release or threatened release of a hazardous or toxic substance and any other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release. In addition to
these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property’s value, we could be liable for certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons or property. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Arising from Our Business—If any of our properties are found to be contaminated, or if we become involved in any environmental disputes, we could incur substantial liabilities and costs.”

We are generally indemnified by the current operators of our properties for
contamination caused by those operators. Under the Kindred Master Leases, Kindred has agreed to indemnify us against any environmental claims (including penalties and clean-up costs) resulting from any condition arising in, on or under, or relating
to, the leased properties at any time on or after the lease commencement date for the applicable leased property and from any condition permitted to deteriorate on or after such date (including as a result of migration from adjacent properties not
owned or operated by us or any of our affiliates other than Kindred and its direct affiliates). However, we cannot assure you that Kindred or another operator will have the financial capability or the willingness to satisfy any such environmental
claims, and in the event Kindred or another operator is unable or unwilling to do so, we may be required to satisfy the claims. See “Risk Factors—Risks Arising from Our Business—We are dependent on Kindred; Kindred’s inability or
unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a
REIT.” We have also agreed to indemnify Kindred and certain of our other operators against any environmental claims (including penalties and clean-up costs) resulting from any condition arising on or under, or relating to, the leased properties
at any time before the lease commencement date for the applicable leased property.

We did not make any material capital expenditures in connection with such environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances and regulations in 2004 and do not expect that we will have to make any such material
capital expenditures during 2005.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

The following discussion of “Federal Income Tax Considerations” is not exhaustive of all possible tax
considerations and is not tax advice. Moreover, this summary does not deal with all tax aspects that might be relevant to a particular stockholder in light of such stockholder’s circumstances, nor does it deal with particular types of
stockholders that are subject to special treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), such as insurance companies, financial institutions and broker-dealers. The Code provisions governing the federal income
tax treatment of REITs are highly technical and complex, and this summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable Code provisions, rules and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof.
The following discussion is based on current law, which could be changed at any time, possibly retroactively.

Federal Income Taxation of Ventas

We elected REIT status beginning with the year ended December 31, 1999. Beginning with the 1999 tax year, we believe that we have satisfied the requirements to qualify as a REIT. We intend to continue to qualify as a
REIT for federal income tax purposes. If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on net income that we currently distribute to stockholders. This treatment substantially
eliminates the “double taxation” (i.e., taxation at both the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results from investment in a corporation.

Notwithstanding our qualification as a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on any undistributed taxable income,
including undistributed net capital gains at regular corporate rates. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax if we do not satisfy specific REIT distribution requirements. See “—Requirements for Qualification as a
REIT—Annual Distribution Requirements.” We may be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our undistributed items of tax preference. If we have (i) net income from the sale or other disposition of “foreclosure
property” (see below) that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or (ii) other non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, we will be subject to tax at the highest corporate rate on such income. See
“—Requirements for Qualification as a REIT—Asset Tests.” In addition, if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” (which are, in general, certain sales or other dispositions of property (other than foreclosure
property) held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business), such income will be subject to a 100% tax.

We may also be subject to “Built-in Gains Tax” on any appreciated asset that we own or acquire that was previously owned by a C corporation
(i.e., a corporation generally subject to full corporate level tax). We own appreciated assets that we held on January 1, 1999, the effective date of our REIT election. These assets are subject to the Built-in Gains Tax rules because we were a
taxable C corporation prior to January 1, 1999. If we dispose of any of these assets and recognize gain on the disposition of such asset during the 10-year period following January 1, 1999, then we generally will be subject to regular corporate
income tax on the gain equal to the lower of (a) the recognized gain at the time of the disposition or (b) the built-in gain in that asset as of January 1, 1999. The total amount of gain on which we can be taxed under the Built-in Gains Tax rules is
limited to our net built-in gain at the time we became a REIT, i.e., the excess of the aggregate fair market value of our assets at the time we became a REIT over the adjusted tax bases of those assets at that time. In connection with the sale of
any assets, all or a portion of such gain could be treated as ordinary income instead of capital gain and be subject to taxation and/or the minimum REIT distribution requirements.

See “—Requirements for Qualification as a REIT” below for other circumstances in which we may be required to
pay federal taxes.

Requirements for Qualification as a REIT

To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet the requirements discussed below, relating to our organization,
sources of income, nature of assets and distributions of income to stockholders.

Organizational Requirements

The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association (i) that is managed by one or more directors or trustees; (ii) the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of
beneficial interest; (iii) that would be taxable as a domestic corporation, but for Sections 856 through 859 of the Code; (iv) that is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the Code; (v) the
beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year (the “100 Shareholder Rule”); (vi) not more than 50% in value of
the outstanding stock of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) during the last half of each taxable year (the “5/50 Rule”); (vii) that makes an election to
be a REIT (or has made such election for a previous taxable year) and satisfies all relevant filing and other administrative requirements established by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) that must be met in order to elect and to
maintain REIT status; (viii) that uses a calendar year for federal income tax purposes; and (ix) that meets certain other tests, described below, regarding the nature of its income and assets.

We believe that we have satisfied the organizational requirements and believe
we will continue to do so in the future. In order to prevent a concentration of ownership of our stock that would cause us to fail the 5/50 Rule or the 100 Shareholder Rule, we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are
intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership. However, such restrictions may not prevent us from failing to meet these requirements, and thereby failing to qualify as a REIT.

In addition, to qualify as a REIT, a corporation may not have (as of the end
of the taxable year) any earnings and profits that were accumulated in periods before it elected REIT status. We believe that at December 31, 1999 we did not have any accumulated earnings and profits that are attributable to periods during which we
were not a REIT, although the IRS would be entitled to challenge that determination.

Gross Income Tests

To
continue to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two annual gross income requirements. First, at least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must consist of defined types of income derived
directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property (including pledges of equity interest in certain entities holding real property and also including “rents from real property” (defined below))
and, in certain circumstances, interest on certain types of temporary investment income. Second, at least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must be derived from such real property or
temporary investments, dividends, interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, or from any combination of the foregoing. To qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests, rental
payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the tenant. Also, the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15% of the total rent. Further, we generally must not operate or manage the
property or furnish or render services to the tenants of such property, other than through an “independent contractor” who is adequately compensated and from whom we derive no income (a de minimis exception is allowed for noncustomary
services provided by us if the annual value of does not exceed 1% of the gross income derived from the property).

Amounts received from a tenant will not qualify as “rents from real property” if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our shares, directly or
constructively is deemed to own 10% or more of the ownership interests in the tenant (a “Related Party Tenant”).



Index to Financial Statements

We do not believe that we have, nor do we anticipate that we will in the future, (i) charged/charge rent
that is based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person (except by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales consistent with the rule described above), (ii) derived/derive rent attributable to
personal property leased in connection with real property that exceeds 15% of the total rents, (iii) derived/derive rent attributable to a Related Party Tenant, or (iv) provided/provide any noncustomary services to tenants other than through
qualifying independent contractors, except as permitted by the 1% de minimis exception or to the extent that the amount of resulting nonqualifying income would not cause us to fail to satisfy the 95% and 75% gross income tests. We believe that we
have been and will continue to be in compliance with the gross income tests. However, we cannot assure you that we are or will continue to be in compliance with the gross income tests.

If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to
qualify as a REIT for such year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. These relief provisions generally will be available if our failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, we
attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our return and any incorrect information on the schedules was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax. It is not possible, however, to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the
benefit of these relief provisions. Even if these relief provisions were to apply, a 100% tax would be imposed with respect to the excess net income.

Asset Tests

At the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must satisfy two tests relating to the nature of our assets. First, at least 75% of the value of our
total assets must be represented by cash or cash items (including certain receivables), government securities, “real estate assets” or, in cases where we raise new capital through stock or long-term (maturity of at least five years) debt
offerings, temporary investments in stock or debt instruments during the one-year period following our receipt of such capital (the “75% asset test”). The term “real estate asset” includes interests in real property, interests in
mortgages on real property to the extent the mortgage balance does not exceed the value of the associated real property, and shares of other REITs. For purposes of the 75% asset test, the term “interest in real property” includes an
interest in land and improvements thereon, such as buildings or other inherently permanent structures (including items that are structural components of such buildings or structures), a leasehold in real property and an option to acquire real
property (or a leasehold in real property). Second, of the investments not included in the 75% asset class, the value of any one issuer’s debt and equity securities owned by us (other than our interest in any entity classified as a partnership
for federal income tax purposes, the stock of a taxable REIT subsidiary (as defined below) or the stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary) may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets (the “5% asset test”), and we may not own more than
10% of any one issuer’s outstanding voting securities or 10% of the value of any one issuer’s outstanding securities, subject to limited “safe harbor” exceptions for certain straight debt obligations (except for our ownership
interest in an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes, that is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that is the stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary) (the “10% securities test”). In addition,
no more than 20% of the value of our assets can be represented by securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries.

If we should fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter except for our first calendar quarter, such a failure would not cause us to
fail to qualify as a REIT or to lose our REIT status if (i) we satisfied all of the asset tests at the close of the preceding calendar quarter and (ii) the discrepancy between the value of our assets and the asset test requirements arose from
changes in the market values of our assets and was not wholly or partly caused by an acquisition of nonqualifying assets. As a result of the enactment of the America Jobs Creation Act of 2004, if the conditions as described in clauses (i) and (ii)
above were not satisfied, we still could avoid disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy within six months after the last day of the quarter in which we identify the asset test failure. A penalty up to $50,000 may be assessed for such failure.
We intend to maintain adequate records of the value of our assets to ensure compliance with the asset tests and to take such other actions as may be required to comply with those tests.



Index to Financial Statements

We believe that we have been and will continue to be in compliance with the 10% securities test and the
5% asset test. However, we cannot assure you that we are or will continue to be in compliance with either of these tests. If we failed to satisfy either of these tests, we would lose our REIT status. If we lost our status as a REIT, it would have a
Material Adverse Effect on us.

Foreclosure Property

The foreclosure property rules permit us (by our
election) to foreclose or repossess properties without being disqualified as a result of receiving income that does not qualify under the gross income tests; however, a corporate tax is imposed upon net income from “foreclosure property”
that is not otherwise “good REIT” income. Detailed rules specify the calculation of the tax. The after-tax amount increases the amount the REIT must distribute each year.

“Foreclosure property” includes any real property and any personal property incident to such real property
acquired by bid at foreclosure or by agreement or process of law after there was a default or a default was imminent on the leased property. However, for qualified healthcare properties, we are permitted to terminate leases other than by reason of
default or imminent default. During a 90-day grace period, we may operate the foreclosed property without an “independent contractor” or qualifying lessee. The 90-day grace period will begin on the date we acquire possession of the
property.

To maintain foreclosure property treatment after the
90-day grace period, we must cause the property to be managed by an “independent contractor” (from whom we derive or receive no income) or lease the property pursuant to a lease qualifying as a true lease for income tax purposes to an
unrelated third party. Ownership of the tenant must not be attributed to us in violation of the related tenant rule of Section 856(d)(2)(B) (relating to 10% or more owned tenants). If the property is leased to a third party under a true lease, the
foreclosure property rules are not then relevant.

Foreclosure
property treatment will end on the first day on which the REIT enters into a lease of the property that will give rise to income that is not good rental income under Section 856(c)(3). In addition, foreclosure property treatment will end if any
construction takes place on the property (other than completion of a building, or other improvement more than 10% complete before default became imminent). Foreclosure property treatment is available for an initial period of three years and may be
extended up to six years. Foreclosure property treatment for qualified healthcare property is available for an initial period of two years and may be extended up to six years.

Taxable REIT Subsidiaries

We are permitted to own up to 100% of a “taxable REIT subsidiary” or a “TRS.” Tax legislation implemented TRS rules to allow REITs
to have greater flexibility in engaging in activities, which previously had been prohibited by REIT rules. TRSs are corporations subject to tax as a regular “C” corporation. Generally, a TRS can own assets that cannot be owned by a REIT
and can perform otherwise impermissible tenant services (excluding the direct or indirect operation or management of a lodging or healthcare facility) which would otherwise disqualify the REIT’s rental income under the REIT income tests. In
enacting the TRS rules, Congress intended that the arrangements between a REIT and its TRSs be structured to ensure that a TRS will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation. As a result, there are certain limits on the ability
of a TRS to deduct interest payments made to us. In addition, we will be obligated to pay a 100% penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by the TRS if the economic arrangements between the REIT, the REIT’s
tenants and the TRS are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties.

On March 26, 2002, we formed a TRS, Ventas Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation. On November 8, 2002, we formed another TRS, Ventas TRS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Both companies are owned
100% by Ventas Realty. As of December 31, 2004, neither Ventas Capital Corporation nor Ventas TRS, LLC owned any of our assets.



Index to Financial Statements

Due to the acquisition of ElderTrust, on February 5, 2004, we also own substantially all of ET Capital
Corporation. ET Capital Corporation is a TRS 100% owned by ETOP. As of December 31, 2004, ET Capital Corporation’s only assets were intercompany loans.

Annual Distribution Requirements

In order to be taxed as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to our stockholders in an amount at least
equal to (i) the sum of (A) 90% of our “REIT taxable income” (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (B) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (ii) the
sum of certain items of non-cash income. Such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first
regular dividend payment after such declaration. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on
the undistributed amount at regular capital gains and ordinary corporate tax rates except to the extent of net operating loss or capital loss carryforwards. If any taxes are paid in connection with the Built-in Gains Tax rules, these taxes will be
deductible in computing REIT taxable income. Furthermore, if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (i) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year (other
than long-term capital gain we elect to retain and treat as having been distributed to stockholders), and (iii) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required
distribution over the amounts actually distributed.

We believe
that we have satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year of our REIT election and each year thereafter. However, we cannot assure you that we have satisfied the distribution requirements for the year of our REIT election and
subsequent years. Although we intend to continue meeting the annual distribution requirements to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2004 and subsequent years, it is possible that economic, market,
legal, tax or other considerations may limit our ability to meet such requirements. As a result, if we were not able to meet the annual distribution requirement, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.

Failure to Continue to Qualify

If our election to be taxed as a REIT is revoked or terminated (e.g., due to
a failure to meet the REIT qualification tests), we will be subject to tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates except to the extent of net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards.
Distributions to stockholders will not be deductible by us, nor will they be required to be made. To the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits, all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income, and, subject to
certain limitations in the Code, corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction. In addition, we would be prohibited from re-electing REIT status for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to
qualify as a REIT, unless certain relief provisions of the Code applied. It is impossible to predict whether we would be entitled to such statutory relief.

Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Stockholders

As used herein, the term “U.S. Stockholder” means a holder of our common stock that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is (i) a citizen or
resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision thereof, (iii) an estate whose income from sources without the United
States is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its connection with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States or (iv) any trust with respect to which (A) a U.S. court is able to exercise
primary supervision over the administration of such trust and (B) one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.



Index to Financial Statements

As long as we qualify as a REIT, distributions made to our taxable U.S. Stockholders out of current or
accumulated earnings and profits (and not designated as capital gain dividends) will be taken into account by such U.S. Stockholders as ordinary income and will not be eligible for the capital gains tax rate (i.e., qualified dividends rate)
generally available to individuals or for the dividends received deduction generally available to corporations. Distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as a capital gain (to the extent such distributions do not
exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year) without regard to the period for which the stockholder has held its shares. The tax rates applicable to such capital gains are discussed below. Distributions in excess of current and
accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a stockholder to the extent that they do not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder’s shares, but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of such shares. To the extent that
distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a stockholder’s shares, such distributions will be included in income as capital gains assuming the shares are capital assets in the hands of
the stockholder. The tax rate applicable to such capital gain will depend on the stockholder’s holding period for the shares. In addition, any distribution declared by us in October, November or December of any year and payable to a stockholder
of record on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by the stockholder on December 31 of such year, provided that the distribution is actually paid by us during January of the following calendar year.

We may elect to treat all or a part of our undistributed net
capital gain as if it had been distributed to our stockholders (including for purposes of the 4% excise tax discussed above under “—Requirements for Qualification as a REIT—Annual Distribution Requirements”). If we make such an
election, our stockholders would be required to include in their income as long-term capital gain their proportionate share of our undistributed net capital gain, as designated by us. Each such stockholder would be deemed to have paid its
proportionate share of the income tax imposed on us with respect to such undistributed net capital gain, and this amount would be credited or refunded to the stockholder. In addition, the tax basis of the stockholder’s shares would be increased
by its proportionate share of undistributed net capital gains included in its income, less its proportionate share of the income tax imposed on us with respect to such gains.

Stockholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses.
Instead, such losses would be carried over by us for potential offset against our future income (subject to certain limitations). Taxable distributions from us and gain from the disposition of our common stock will not be treated as passive activity
income and, therefore, stockholders generally will not be able to apply any “passive activity losses” (such as losses from certain types of limited partnerships in which the stockholder is a limited partner) against such income. In
addition, taxable distributions from us generally will be treated as investment income for purposes of the investment interest limitations. Capital gains from the disposition of the shares (or distributions treated as such) will be treated as
investment income only if the stockholder so elects, in which case such capital gains will be taxed at ordinary income rates. We will notify stockholders after the close of our taxable year as to the portions of the distributions attributable to
that year that constitute ordinary income, return of capital and capital gain.

In general, any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of our common stock by a stockholder who is not a dealer in securities will be treated as capital gain or loss. Lower marginal tax rates for individuals
may apply in the case of capital gains, depending on the holding period of the shares that are sold. However, any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares by a stockholder who has held such shares for six months or less (after applying certain holding
period rules) will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of distributions from us required to be treated by such stockholder as long-term capital gain. All or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares may be
disallowed if other shares are purchased within 30 days before or after the disposition.

For non-corporate taxpayers, the tax rate differential between capital gain and ordinary income may be significant. The highest marginal individual income tax rate applicable to ordinary income is currently 35%. Any
capital gain generally will be currently taxed to a non-corporate taxpayer at a maximum rate of 15% with respect



Index to Financial Statements

to capital assets held for more than one year. The tax rates applicable to ordinary income apply to gain attributable to the sale or exchange of capital
assets held for one year or less. In the case of capital gain attributable to the sale or exchange of certain real property held for more than one year, an amount of such gain equal to the amount of all prior depreciation deductions not otherwise
required to be taxed as ordinary depreciation recapture income will be taxed at a maximum rate of 25%. With respect to distributions designated by a REIT as capital gain dividends (including deemed distributions of retained capital gains), the REIT
also may designate (subject to certain limits) whether the dividend is taxable to non-corporate stockholders as a 15% rate gain distribution or an unrecaptured depreciation distribution taxed at a 25% rate.

The characterization of income as capital or ordinary may affect the
deductibility of capital losses. Capital losses not offset by capital gains generally may be deducted against a non-corporate taxpayer’s ordinary income only up to a maximum annual amount of $3,000. Non-corporate taxpayers may carry forward
their unused capital losses. All net capital gain of a corporate taxpayer is subject to tax at ordinary corporate rates. A corporate taxpayer can deduct capital losses only to the extent of capital gains, with unused losses being carried back three
years and forward five years.

Treatment of Tax-Exempt Stockholders

Tax-exempt organizations, including qualified employee
pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts (collectively, “Exempt Organizations”), generally are exempt from federal income taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable
income (“UBTI”). While many investments in real estate generate UBTI, the IRS has issued a published ruling that dividend distributions by a REIT to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares of the
REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust. Based on that ruling, and subject to the exceptions discussed below, amounts distributed by us to Exempt Organizations generally should not
constitute UBTI. However, if an Exempt Organization finances its acquisition of our common stock with debt, a portion of its income from us will constitute UBTI pursuant to the “debt-financed property” rules. Furthermore, social clubs,
voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans that are exempt from taxation under paragraphs (7), (9), (17) and (20), respectively, of Section 501(c) of the Code are
subject to different UBTI rules, which generally will require them to characterize distributions from us as UBTI. In addition, in certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns more than 10% of our stock is required to treat a percentage of the
dividends from us as UBTI (the “UBTI Percentage”). The UBTI Percentage is the gross income, less related direct expenses, derived by us from an unrelated trade or business (determined as if we were a pension trust) divided by our gross
income, less related direct expenses, for the year in which the dividends are paid. The UBTI rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10% of our stock only if (i) the UBTI Percentage is at least 5%, (ii) we qualify as a REIT by reason of
the modification of the 5/50 Rule that allows the beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding our shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and (iii) either (A) one pension trust owns more than 25% of the
value of our stock or (B) a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10% of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50% of the value of our stock.

Special Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Stockholders

The rules governing U.S. federal income taxation of nonresident alien individuals, foreign corporations, foreign
partnerships and other foreign stockholders (collectively, “Non-U.S. Stockholders”) are complex, and no attempt will be made herein to provide more than a summary of such rules. Non-U.S. stockholders should consult with their own tax
advisors to determine the impact of federal, state and local income tax laws with regard to their ownership of our common stock, including any reporting requirements.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Stockholder” does not include any foreign stockholder whose
investment in our stock is “effectively connected” with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Such a foreign stockholder, in general, will be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to its



Index to Financial Statements

investment in our stock in the same manner as a U.S. Stockholder is taxed (subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum
tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals). In addition, a foreign corporation receiving income that is treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business also may be subject to an additional 30% “branch profits tax,”
unless an applicable tax treaty provides a lower rate or an exemption. Certain certification requirements must be satisfied in order for effectively connected income to be exempt from withholding.

Distributions to Non-U.S. Stockholders that are not attributable to gain from
sales or exchanges by us of U.S. real property interests and are not designated by us as capital gain dividends (or deemed distributions of retained capital gains) will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out
of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. Such distributions ordinarily will be subject to a withholding tax equal to 30% of the gross amount of the distribution unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates that tax. Distributions
in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a stockholder to the extent that such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder’s shares, but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of
such shares. To the extent that distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a Non-U.S. Stockholder’s shares, such distributions will give rise to tax liability if the Non-U.S. Stockholder
would otherwise be subject to tax on any gain from the sale or disposition of its shares, as described below.

For any year in which we qualify as a REIT, distributions that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of U.S. real property interests will
be taxed to a Non-U.S. Stockholder under the provisions of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”). Under FIRPTA, distributions attributable to gain from sales of U.S. real property interests are taxed to a
Non-U.S. Stockholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. business. Non-U.S. Stockholders thus would be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to U.S. Stockholders (subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a
special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals). Distributions subject to FIRPTA also may be subject to 30% branch profits tax in the hands of a foreign corporate stockholder not entitled to treaty relief or exemption.

We expect to withhold U.S. tax at the rate of 30% on the gross
amount of any dividends, other than dividends treated as attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests and capital gain dividends, paid to a Non-U.S. Stockholder, unless (i) a lower treaty rate applies and the required
form evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with us or the appropriate withholding agent or (ii) the Non-U.S. Stockholder files an IRS Form W-8 ECI or a successor form with us or the appropriate withholding agent claiming that the
distributions are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Stockholder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business.

Under FIRPTA, we are required to withhold 35% of any distribution that is designated as a capital gain dividend or which could be designated as a capital
gain dividend. Thus, if we designate previously made distributions as capital gain dividends, subsequent distributions (up to the amount of such prior distributions) will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of FIRPTA withholding.

For so long as our common stock continues to be regularly
traded on an established securities market, the sale of such stock by any Non-U.S. Stockholder who is not a Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder (as defined below) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax (unless the Non-U.S.
Stockholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions apply, in which case such gain will be subject to a 30% tax on a gross basis).
A “Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder” is a Non-U.S. Stockholder who, at some time during the five-year period preceding such sale or disposition, beneficially owned (including under certain attribution rules) more than 5% of the total fair
market value of our common stock (as outstanding from time to time) or owned shares of another class of our stock that represented value greater than 5% of our common stock (measured at the time such shares were acquired).



Index to Financial Statements

In general, the sale or other taxable disposition of our common stock by a Five Percent Non-U.S.
Stockholder also will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if we are a “domestically controlled REIT.” A REIT is a “domestically controlled REIT” if, at all times during the five-year period preceding the relevant testing
date, less than 50% in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by Non-U.S. Stockholders (taking into account those persons required to include the REIT’s dividends in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes). Although we believe
that we currently qualify as a domestically controlled REIT because our common stock is publicly traded, we cannot assure you that we will qualify as a domestically controlled REIT at any time in the future. If we do not constitute a domestically
controlled REIT, a Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder will be taxable in the same manner as a U.S. Stockholder with respect to gain on the sale of our common stock (subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax
in the case of nonresident alien individuals).

Information Reporting
Requirements and Backup Withholding Tax

We will report to
our U.S. Stockholders and to the IRS the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and distributions required to be treated as so paid during a calendar year, and the amount of tax withheld, if any. Under the backup withholding rules, a
stockholder may be subject to backup withholding at the applicable rate (currently 28%) with respect to distributions paid unless such holder (i) is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories and, when required, demonstrates this
fact or (ii) provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. A stockholder who does not provide us with
its correct taxpayer identification number also may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS. In addition, we may be required to withhold a portion of capital gain distributions to any stockholders who fail to certify their non-foreign status to
us.

U.S. Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors
regarding their qualifications for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a U.S.
Stockholder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Stockholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Stockholder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.

Backup withholding tax and information reporting generally will not apply to
distributions paid to Non-U.S. Stockholders outside the United States that are treated as (i) dividends subject to the 30% (or lower treaty rate) withholding tax discussed above, (ii) capital gain dividends or (iii) distributions attributable to
gain from the sale or exchange by us of U.S. real property interests. As a general matter, backup withholding and information reporting will not apply to a payment of the proceeds of a sale of our common stock by or through a foreign office of a
foreign broker. Information reporting (but not backup withholding) will apply, however, to a payment of the proceeds of a sale of our common stock by a foreign office of a broker that (i) is a United States person, (ii) derives 50% or more of its
gross income for certain periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or (iii) is a “controlled foreign corporation” for United States tax purposes, unless the broker has documentary evidence in its records that
the holder is a Non-U.S. Stockholder and certain other conditions are satisfied, or the stockholder otherwise establishes an exemption. Payment to or through a United States office of a broker of the proceeds of a sale of our common stock is subject
to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the stockholder certifies under penalties of perjury that the stockholder is a Non-U.S. Stockholder or otherwise establishes an exemption. A Non-U.S. Stockholder may obtain a refund of any
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS.

Other Tax Considerations

We and our stockholders may be subject to state and local tax in states and localities in which we do business or own property. The tax treatment of us and our stockholders in such jurisdictions may differ from the federal income tax
treatment described above. Consequently, stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on their ownership of shares of our common stock.

RISK FACTORS

Our business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks. Some of these risks are described below;
however, this section does not describe all risks applicable to us, our industry or our business, and it is intended only as a summary of certain material factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, we could be materially and adversely
affected.

We have grouped these risk factors into three general categories:

•

risks arising from our business;

•

risks arising from our capital structure; and

•

risks arising from our status as a REIT.

Risks Arising from Our Business

We are dependent on Kindred; Kindred’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm
us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT.

We are dependent on Kindred in a number of ways:

•

We lease a substantial portion of our properties to Kindred under the Kindred Master Leases, and therefore:

•

Kindred was the primary source of our total revenues in 2004 and 2003; and

•

since the Kindred Master Leases are triple-net leases, we depend on Kindred to pay insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses required in connection with the
leased properties.

•

In connection with the 1998 Spin Off, Kindred assumed, and agreed to indemnify us for, the following:

•

all obligations under third-party leases and third-party contracts, except for those contracts relating to the ownership of our properties;

•

all losses, including costs and expenses, resulting from future claims and all liabilities that may arise out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations either
before or after the date of the spin-off; and

•

any claims that were pending at the time of the spin-off and that arose out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations or were asserted after the spin-off and that
arise out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets or liabilities transferred to Kindred in connection with the spin-off.

We cannot assure you that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing and insurance coverage to
enable it to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us. In addition, any failure by Kindred to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain
patients in its facilities. Any inability or unwillingness on the part of Kindred to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. See “Business—Dependence on Kindred.”

We may be unable to find another lessee/operator for our properties if we
have to replace Kindred or our other operators.

We may
have to find another lessee/operator for the properties covered by one or more of the Kindred Master Leases or the leases with our other operators upon the expiration of the terms of the applicable lease or upon a default by Kindred or our other
operators. During any period that we are attempting to locate one or more



Index to Financial Statements

lessees/operators there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments by Kindred or our other operators. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
locate another suitable lessee/operator or, if we are successful in locating such an operator, that the rental payments from the new operator would not be significantly less than the existing rental payments. Our ability to locate another suitable
lessee/operator may be significantly delayed or limited by various state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules. In addition, we may also incur substantial additional expenses in
connection with any such licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. Such delays, limitations and expenses could have a Material Adverse Effect on us and/or materially delay or impact our ability to collect rent, to obtain possession
of leased properties or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant default.

We may encounter certain risks when implementing our business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional healthcare-related and/or senior housing assets.

We intend to continue to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or
development of, additional healthcare-related and/or senior housing assets, subject to the contractual restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes. Acquisitions of and investments
in such properties entail general investment risks associated with any real estate investment, including risks that the investment will fail to perform in accordance with expectations, the estimates of the cost of improvements necessary for acquired
properties will prove inaccurate and the lessee/operator will fail to meet performance expectations. If we pursue new development projects, such projects would be subject to numerous risks, including risks of construction delays or cost overruns
that may increase project costs, new project commencement risks such as receipt of zoning, occupancy and other required governmental approvals and permits and the incurrence of development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to
completion. In addition, we may borrow to finance investments in, and/or acquisition or development of, healthcare-related or other properties, which would increase our leverage.

We compete for acquisition or investment opportunities with entities that have substantially greater financial resources
than we have. Our ability to compete successfully for such opportunities is affected by many factors, including our cost of obtaining debt and equity capital at rates comparable to or better than our competitors. Competition generally may reduce the
number of suitable acquisition or investment opportunities available to us and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding our acquisitions, investment or development activities. See
“Business—Competition.”

Even if we are
successful at identifying and competing for acquisition or investment opportunities, such opportunities involve a number of risks. These risks include diversion of management’s attention, the risk that the value of the properties or businesses
we acquire or invest in could decrease substantially after such acquisition or investment and the risk that we will not be able to accurately assess the value of properties or businesses that are not of the type we currently own, some or all of
which could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Additionally, if we are successful in continuing to implement our business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional, healthcare-related and/or senior housing assets or businesses, we intend to
increase the number of operators of our properties and our business segments. We cannot assure you that we will have the capabilities to successfully monitor and manage a portfolio of properties with a growing number of operators and/or manage such
businesses.

We are subject to the risks associated with
investment in a single industry, the heavily regulated healthcare industry.

All of our investments are in properties used in the healthcare industry; therefore we are exposed to risks associated with the healthcare industry in particular. The healthcare industry is highly regulated and
changes in government regulation have in the past had material adverse consequences on the industry in general, which may not even have been contemplated by lawmakers and regulators. We cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation
of healthcare will not have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry, including



Index to Financial Statements

our lessees/operators. Moreover, our ability to invest in non-healthcare, non-healthcare-related or non-senior housing properties is restricted by the terms
of our revolving credit facility. See “Governmental Regulation—Healthcare Regulation.”

Our tenants, including Kindred, may be adversely affected by increasing healthcare regulation and enforcement.

We believe that the regulatory environment surrounding the long-term care
industry has intensified both in the amount and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. This is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like Kindred.

The extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the
healthcare industry include, but are not limited to, laws and regulations relating to licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, quality of care,
patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, and financial and other arrangements which may be entered into by healthcare providers. Federal and state governments have intensified enforcement policies, resulting in a significant increase in the
number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, bars on Medicare and Medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even
criminal penalties. See “Governmental Regulation—Healthcare Regulation.” If Kindred or our other tenants and operators fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses, they
could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, suffer civil and/or criminal penalties and/or be required to make significant changes to their operations. Kindred and our other tenants also
could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. In addition, as part of the settlement agreement Kindred entered into with the federal government, it
agreed to comply with the terms of a corporate integrity agreement. Kindred could incur additional expenses in complying with the corporate integrity agreement, and its failure to comply with the corporate integrity agreement could have a material
adverse effect on Kindred’s results of operations, financial condition and its ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

We are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local regulation or legislation, including the Medicare and
Medicaid statutes and regulations. Changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on Kindred and our other operators, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party
payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on our tenants.

Kindred and certain of our other tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, for
substantially all of their revenues. See “Governmental Regulation—Healthcare Regulation.” There continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost-containment measures that limit payments
to healthcare providers. In addition, private third-party payors have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. We cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services to be provided by Kindred and other
tenants which are currently being reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material
adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of Kindred and certain of our other operators and tenants, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Significant legal actions could subject Kindred and our other operators to
increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect Kindred’s and our other operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operation.

Although claims and costs of professional liability insurance seem to be
growing at a slower pace, over the past few years, Kindred and our other skilled nursing facility operators have experienced substantial increases in



Index to Financial Statements

both the number and size of professional liability claims in recent years. In addition to large compensatory claims, plaintiffs’ attorneys continue to
seek significant punitive damages and attorneys’ fees.

Due to the high level in the number and severity of professional liability claims against healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has been severely restricted and the premiums on such insurance coverage
have increased dramatically. As a result, Kindred’s and our other operators’ insurance coverage might not cover all claims against them or continue to be available to them at a reasonable cost. If Kindred or our other operators are unable
to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, they may be exposed to substantial liabilities.

Kindred insures its professional liability risks in part through a wholly-owned, limited purpose insurance company. The limited purpose insurance company
insures initial losses up to specified coverage levels per occurrence with no aggregate coverage limit. Coverage for losses in excess of those per occurrence levels is maintained through unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers up to an aggregate
limit. The limited purpose insurance company then insures all claims in excess of the aggregate limit for the unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers. Kindred maintains general liability insurance and professional malpractice liability insurance
in amounts and with deductibles which Kindred management has indicated that it believes are sufficient for its operations.

Operators that insure their professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of
professional liability through actuarial studies which rely primarily on historical data. However, due to the increase in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the
future cost of claims and we cannot assure you that such operators’ reserves for future claims will be adequate to cover the actual cost of such claims. If the actual cost of such claims is significantly higher than the operators’
reserves, it could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operation of our operators and their ability to make rental payments to us, which in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

Kindred and our other operators may be sued under a federal
whistleblower statute.

Kindred and our other operators
may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. See “Government Regulation—Healthcare Regulation.” These lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award
bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. If any such lawsuits were to be brought against Kindred or our other operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a
material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operation of Kindred and our other operators and their ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

If any of our properties are found to be contaminated, or if we become
involved in any environmental disputes, we could incur substantial liabilities and costs.

Under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or
petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. Owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by
regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or
disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. In certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. While we are generally indemnified by the current operators of
our properties for contamination caused by such operators, such indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs. See “Government Regulation—Environmental Regulation.”

Risks Arising from Our Capital Structure

We may become more leveraged.

As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $843.2 million of indebtedness. Our revolving credit facility and the
indentures governing our outstanding senior notes permit us to incur substantial additional debt, and we may borrow additional funds, which may include secured borrowings. A high level of indebtedness may have the following consequences:

•

a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of debt service, thus reducing the funds available for our business strategy and for
distributions to stockholders;

•

potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate
and/or healthcare sectors;

•

a potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing for our business strategy; and

•

a potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies which could have the effect of, among other things, increasing the cost of our borrowing.

We may be unable to raise additional capital
necessary to continue to implement our business plan and to meet our debt payments.

In order to continue to implement our business plan and to meet our debt payments, we may need to raise additional capital. Our ability to incur additional indebtedness is restricted by the terms of our revolving
credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes. In addition, adverse economic conditions could cause the terms on which we can obtain additional borrowings to become unfavorable. In such circumstances, we may be required
to raise additional equity in the capital markets or liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on the investments and that could result in adverse tax consequences to us. In
addition, certain healthcare regulations may constrain our ability to sell assets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations, and the failure to do so could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.

We hedge our floating-rate debt with an interest rate swap and may record
charges and incur costs associated with the termination or change in value of our interest rate swap.

We have an interest rate swap agreement to hedge all or a portion of our existing floating-rate debt through June 30, 2008. We periodically assess our
interest rate swap in relation to our outstanding balances of floating-rate debt, and based on such assessments may terminate portions of our swap or enter into additional swaps. Termination of swaps with accrued losses, or changes in the value of
swaps as a result of falling interest rates, would require the payment of costs and/or result in charges to our earnings and net worth.

Risks Arising from Our Status as a REIT

Loss of our status as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our common stock.

If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious tax consequences that
will substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because:

•

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;

•

we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and

•

unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were
disqualified.



Index to Financial Statements

In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders would continue to be
treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earning and profits, although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates
generally applicable to long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 15%) with respect to distributions. We would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain REIT status.

As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could
impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and
administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. In addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative
interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes. Although we believe that we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain
qualified as a REIT for tax purposes.

See “Federal Income
Tax Considerations—Federal Income Taxation of Ventas” and “—Requirements for Qualification as a REIT.”

The 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions.

To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and
to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. See “Federal Income Tax Considerations—Requirements for Qualification as a REIT—Annual Distribution Requirements.” The indentures governing
our outstanding senior notes permit us to make annual distributions to our stockholders in an amount equal to the minimum amount necessary to maintain our REIT status so long as the ratio of our Debt to Adjusted Total Assets (as each term is defined
in the indentures) does not exceed 60% and to make additional distributions if we pass certain other financial tests. However, distributions may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our properties or subsequently acquired properties
to finance investments, acquisitions or new developments.

Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to
meet the 90% distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. This may be due to the timing differences between the actual receipt of income and
actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition, nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or
repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may also cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement.

In the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to
retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended
to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see “—Risks Arising from Our Capital Structure—We may be unable to raise additional capital
necessary to continue to implement our business plan and to meet our debt payments.” The terms of our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes restrict our ability to engage in some of these
transactions.



Index to Financial Statements

We may still be subject to corporate level taxes.

Following our REIT election, we are considered to be a former C corporation
for income tax purposes. Therefore, potentially, we remain subject to corporate level taxes for any asset dispositions occurring on or before December 31, 2008.

ITEM 2.

Properties

Healthcare and Senior Housing Facilities

As of December 31, 2004, we owned 201 skilled nursing facilities, 40 hospitals, 30 senior housing facilities and 16 other facilities in 39 states. We believe that the geographic diversity of the properties makes our
portfolio less susceptible to adverse changes in state reimbursement and regulation and regional economic downturns.

Ventas Realty has granted mortgage liens on certain of its properties to secure borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and Ventas Finance has
granted mortgage liens on all of the properties covered by the Kindred CMBS Master Lease to secure a loan in the original principal amount of $225.0 million from Merrill Lynch Mortgage Lending, Inc. In addition, certain subsidiaries of Ventas
have mortgage debt secured by that subsidiary’s facility.

Selected Financial Data

You should read the following selected financial data in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Index to Financial Statements

(1)

We consider funds from operations (“FFO”) an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT, and we use the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts’ (“NAREIT”) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”)), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate
property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact
that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from
operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is FFO indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations—Results of Operations—Funds from Operations” included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

•

We raised $51.1 million of equity with the public sale of two million shares of our common stock.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(“GAAP”), which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among
others, affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements.



Index to Financial Statements

Long-Lived Assets

Investments in real estate properties are recorded at cost. We account for acquisitions using the purchase method. The cost
of the properties acquired is allocated among tangible land, buildings and equipment and recognized intangibles based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No.
141, “Business Combinations.” We estimate fair values of the components of assets acquired as of the acquisition date or engage a third party appraiser as necessary. Recognized intangibles, if any, include the value of acquired lease
contracts and related customer relationships.

Our method for
determining fair value varies with the categorization of the asset acquired. We estimate the fair value of buildings on an as-if-vacant basis, and amortize the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building. We determine the
allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and amortize such value over their estimated remaining useful lives. We determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value
of the asset, internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio or third party appraisals. The fair value of in-place leases, if any, reflects (i) above and below market leases, if any, determined by
discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in-place rentals, the resulting intangible asset of which is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal
periods, if applicable, (ii) the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants, including tenant allowances, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease, and (iii) an estimated
value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period, as if the acquired space was vacant, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease. We also
estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with such tenant, such tenant’s credit
quality, expectations of lease renewals with such tenant, and the potential for significant, additional future leasing arrangements with such tenant. We amortize such value, if any, over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases,
which would include the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected renewal periods.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily consisting of our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. If indicators of
impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations and adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long-lived
assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future cash flow or sales proceeds is less than book value. An impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such adjustment. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that
impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.

Revenue Recognition

Certain of our leases,
excluding our master lease agreements (the “Kindred Master Leases”) with Kindred Healthcare, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Kindred”), provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. Base rental
revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable lease. Certain of our other leases, including the Kindred Master Leases, provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue
parameters or other contingencies are met. We recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other contingencies are met rather than on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable lease. We
recognize income from rent, lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 104: (i) the agreement has been fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have been
rendered; (iii) the amount is fixed or determinable; and (iv) the collectibility is reasonably assured.



Index to Financial Statements

Legal Contingencies

We are involved in litigation as described in “Note 13—Litigation” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. We evaluate such matters by (i) ascertaining the probability that such litigation could result in a loss for us and (ii) determining an estimate of any possible loss. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies,” we accrue for any probable losses that are estimable and disclose any loss contingencies that are possible. If management’s assessment of our liability with respect to these actions is incorrect, such matters could have a
material adverse effect on us.

Fair Value of Derivative
Instruments

The valuation of derivative instruments
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair values for our derivatives are verified with a third party consultant which utilizes pricing models that consider forward yield curves and discount
rates. Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts in the financial statements are subject to significant estimates which may change in the future.

Adoption of Accounting Policies

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No.
123(R)”), which is a revision to SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS No. 123”). SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” (“APB Opinion No. 25”). Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123, except that SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
employee stock options, be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under SFAS No. 123(R).

As required under SFAS No. 123(R), we expect to adopt the provisions of this accounting standard on July 1, 2005. We
expect to apply the modified prospective method of adoption in which compensation cost is recognized beginning on the date we adopt the accounting standard for all share-based payments granted after the adoption date and for all awards granted to
employees prior to the adoption date that remain unvested on the adoption date. As permitted by SFAS No. 123(R), we currently account for share-based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25 and, as such,
generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) is expected to result in an immaterial increase in expense during the second half of 2005 based on unvested options outstanding as of December 31,
2004 and current compensation plans. While the effect of adoption depends on the level of share-based payments granted in the future and unvested grants on the date we adopt SFAS No. 123(R), the effect of this accounting standard on our prior
operating results would approximate the effect of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share. See “Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity and Stock Options” of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

In April 2002, FASB issued SFAS
No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Correction” (“SFAS 145”). SFAS No. 4, “Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt” (“SFAS
4”), required that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt that were included in the determination of net income be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item. The provisions of SFAS 145 that relate to the
rescission of SFAS 4 required us to reclassify certain prior period items that no longer meet the extraordinary classification into continuing operations. Additionally, future gains and losses related to debt extinguishment may be required to be
classified as income from continuing operations. The provisions of SFAS 145 relating to the rescission of SFAS 4 became effective in fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. As required, on January 1, 2003 we adopted SFAS 145. In accordance with
SFAS 145, our prior year financial statements have been reclassified to include gains and losses from extinguishment of debt in continuing operations. This reclassification has no effect on our net income.



Index to Financial Statements

Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”), SFAS 144 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS 144 extends the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to
include components of an entity that have either been disposed or are classified as held for sale. The operating results of properties that were disposed of subsequent to January 1, 2002 have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the
Consolidated Statements of Income for each of the three years ended December 31, 2004 included herein. See “Note 5—Dispositions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Results of Operations

The tables below show our results of operations for each year and the absolute and percentage change in those results from
year to year.

Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003

Revenues

The increase in our 2004 rental income reflects (i) a
$10.4 million increase resulting from the 3.5% annual increase in the rent paid under Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2004, and the rent increase from the July 1, 2003 amendment to the Kindred Master Leases, and (ii) the recognition of
$32.1 million in additional rent relating to the properties acquired during 2004. See “Note 6—Mergers and Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The rental income from Kindred includes $2.3 million related to
the



Index to Financial Statements

amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of our receipt of Kindred common stock in connection with Kindred’s emergence from bankruptcy on
April 20, 2001 and the receipt of $4.5 million of additional future rent under the Kindred Master Leases.

Interest income from loan receivable represents interest income received in connection with a $17.0 million mezzanine loan made to Trans Healthcare, Inc.
(“THI”) on November 4, 2002. As of February 15, 2005, the mezzanine loan amount outstanding was $12.4 million.

The decrease in interest and other income is primarily attributable to the recovery in 2003 of a previously written-off receivable.

Expenses

The increase in general, administrative and professional fees is primarily
attributable to costs associated with our initiative to develop and market our strategic diversification program, engage in comprehensive asset management, comply with regulatory requirements such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and to attract
and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, we reported an increase of approximately $20.2 million to our operating results, reflecting the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability. See “Note 10—Income Taxes” of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Depreciation
expense increased primarily due to the properties acquired during 2004. See “Note 6—Mergers and Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As a result of anticipated lower variable rate debt balances due to the sale of 10 facilities on December 11, 2003, we
entered into an agreement with the counterparty to our interest rate swap to break $120.0 million of the $450.0 million notional amount in exchange for a payment to the counterparty of approximately $8.6 million. In addition, we recognized $3.4
million of a previously deferred gain recorded in connection with the 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of a separate interest rate swap. The $5.2 million net expense, which was previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive income on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was recognized as a net expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Interest expense includes $3.9 million and $4.1 million of amortized deferred financing costs for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $0.4 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Total interest expense, excluding interest on the United States settlement but
including interest allocated to discontinued operations, increased $2.0 million in 2004 over 2003. The increase in interest expense from continuing and discontinued operations was due primarily to (i) a $6.6 million increase related to the assumed
debt for the ElderTrust merger and Brookdale transactions partially offset by, (ii) a $3.2 million decrease from lower effective interest rates, (iii) a $0.8 million decrease from the amortization of a deferred gain recorded in connection with
the 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of our previous $800.0 million notional amount interest rate swap (the “1998 Swap”), (iv) a $0.3 million decrease from reduced principal balances of our existing debt and (v) a $0.3 million
decrease in amortization of deferred financing costs.

In
September 2004, we refinanced indebtedness under our prior credit agreement at lower interest rates and incurred a loss from extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

Interest expense on our settlement with the United States Department of
Justice declined to zero in 2004 from $4.9 million in 2003 due to full prepayment in 2003. On June 30, 2003, we incurred a $2.7 million non-cash expense relating to the early repayment of the settlement that is reflected as interest on United States
settlement on our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2003. There was no prepayment penalty or other cash expense upon early repayment of the United States settlement. See “Note 11—Commitments and
Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Index to Financial Statements

Gain On Sale of Kindred Common Stock

During the year ended December 31, 2003, we disposed of 920,814 shares of
Kindred common stock and recognized a gain of $9.0 million. Since the sale, we have not owned any shares of Kindred common stock.

Discontinued Operations

The decrease in discontinued operations is a result of a lower net gain on the sale of properties in 2004. Discontinued operations in 2003 includes the
net income of 27 properties sold in 2003 and in 2004, whereas the discontinued operations in 2004 only includes the net income of two properties sold in 2004.

In 2004, we completed the sale of two facilities for $21.1 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of $19.4 million. In
addition, the tenant paid us lease termination fees approximating $0.5 million. In 2003, we completed the sale of 27 facilities for $139.2 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of $51.8 million. In addition, the tenants
paid us lease termination fees approximating $10.1 million. The net gains and lease termination fees are included in discontinued operations for the respective years in which the dispositions occurred.

See “Note 5—Dispositions” of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Years Ended December 31, 2003 and



Index to Financial Statements

Revenues

The increase in 2003 rental income reflects (i) the 3.5% increase in the rent paid under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2003, (ii) the $8.6
million increase in annualized rent on certain Kindred facilities effective July 1, 2003 and (iii) $6.0 million in additional rent earned during the year ended December 31, 2003 under our master lease with THI.

The rental income from Kindred includes $2.3 million related to the
amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of our receipt of Kindred common stock on April 20, 2001 and the receipt of $4.5 million of additional future rent under the Kindred Master Leases.

Interest income from loan receivable represents interest income received in
connection with the THI mezzanine loan.

The increase in
interest and other income is primarily attributable to the recovery in 2003 of a previously written-off receivable. In addition, interest income increased due to higher cash balances on hand to invest during 2003, which was partially offset by
reduced interest rates.

Expenses

The increase in general, administrative and professional fees is primarily
attributable to costs associated with our initiative to develop and market our strategic diversification program, to improve our overall asset management system, and to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, we reported an
increase of approximately $20.2 million to our operating results, reflecting the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability. See “Note 10—Income Taxes” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded an expense of $5.2 million
related to the loss on a $120 million notional swap breakage. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded an expense of $5.4 million related to the loss on a $350 million notional swap breakage. See “Note 7—Borrowing
Arrangements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest expense includes $4.1 million and $3.7 million of amortized deferred financing costs for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $3.5 million and $6.2
million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total interest expense, excluding interest on the United States settlement but including interest allocated to discontinued operations, decreased $13.4 million in 2003 over 2002.
The decrease in interest expense from continuing and discontinued operations was due primarily to (i) a $9.9 million decrease as a result of reduced debt balances, (ii) a $0.4 million decrease from reduced interest rates, (iii) a $1.6 million
decrease in swap ineffectiveness (See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and (iv) a $1.5 million decrease from the amortization of a deferred gain recorded in connection with a 1999
transaction to shorten the maturity of the 1998 Swap. We recorded swap ineffectiveness in the Consolidated Statement of Income of $0.3 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, to reflect the value of the
excess of the notional amount of the 1998 Swap and 2003-2008 Swap (as defined below) over our future anticipated variable rate debt balance.

In April 2002, we refinanced indebtedness under our prior credit agreement and incurred a loss from extinguishment of debt of $6.9 million related to the
write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our previous revolving credit facility. In December 2002, we incurred an additional $4.2 loss related to the repurchase of $34.0 million principal amount of our outstanding senior
notes consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums paid to repurchase.



Index to Financial Statements

On June 30, 2003, we incurred a $2.7 million expense relating to the early repayment of our United States
settlement that is reflected as interest on United States Settlement on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Gain on Sale of Kindred Common Stock

During the year ended December 31, 2003, we disposed of 920,814 shares of Kindred common stock and recognized a gain of $9.0 million. During the year
ended December 31, 2002, we disposed of 159,500 shares of Kindred common stock and recognized a gain of $5.0 million.

Discontinued Operations

The increase in discontinued operations is a result of a higher net gain on the sale of properties in 2003, offset by the loss of net income due to the
sales. Discontinued operations in 2002 includes the net income of properties sold in 2002 and in 2003, whereas the discontinued operations in 2003 only includes the net income of properties sold in 2003.

In the second quarter ended June 30, 2002, we sold a skilled nursing facility
for $1.5 million in net cash proceeds to an unrelated third party and recognized a gain of $1.1 million which was included as a component of discontinued operations and we sold a hospital facility for $27.1 million in net cash proceeds to an
unrelated third party and recognized a gain of $22.4 million which was also included as a component of discontinued operations.

Funds from Operations

Our funds from operations (“FFO”) for the five years ended December 31, 2004 are summarized in the following table:

Historical cost
accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have
considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, we consider FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT, and we
use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real
estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use
the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative



Index to Financial Statements

to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities
(determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical
operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Asset/Liability Management

Asset/liability management is a key element of our overall risk management
program. The objective of asset/liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels. The asset/liability management process focuses on a variety of risks, including market risk
(primarily interest rate risk) and credit risk. Effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and
liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Market Risk

We receive revenue primarily by leasing our assets under leases that are long-term triple net-leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with
annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. We also earn revenue from the THI mezzanine loan. Our obligations under our revolving credit facility are floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly interest payments vary
with the movement in LIBOR. The general fixed nature of our assets and the variable nature of our obligations create interest rate risk. If interest rates were to rise significantly, our lease and other revenue might not be sufficient to meet our
debt obligations. In order to mitigate this risk, on September 28, 2001, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of $450 million to hedge floating rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008 (the
“2003-2008 Swap”). The swap is treated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes and is with a highly rated counterparty on which we pay a fixed rate of 5.385% and receive LIBOR from the counterparty. On December 11, 2003, due to our
lower expected future variable debt balances, we reduced the notional amount of the swap for the period from December 11, 2003 through June 29, 2006 from $450 million to $330 million. See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements. There are no collateral requirements under the swap. The notional amount of the swap is scheduled to decline from $330.0 million as follows:

To highlight the
sensitivity of the interest rate swap and fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points (BPS) in interest rates as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 (in
thousands):



Index to Financial Statements

(a)

The change in fair value of the swap was due to the general increase in interest rates. The change in fair value of fixed rate debt was due to (i) the assumption of approximately
$96.3 million in fixed rate debt as a result of our ElderTrust merger and acquisitions during 2004, the fair value of which approximated book value at December 31, 2004, (ii) the issuance of $125.0 million in Senior Notes (as defined below) in
October 2004, the fair value of which was approximately $127.5 million at December 31, 2004, and (iii) general increase in interest rates.

N/A

Not applicable.

We paid $13.3 million under the swap during the year ended December 31, 2004. Assuming that interest rates do not change, we estimate that we will pay
approximately $7.7 million on the swap during the year ending December 31, 2005.

The carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value. There is no cash flow impact from the fluctuation of interest rates because we currently hedge 100% of our variable rate debt. The fair value of
our fixed rate debt is $636.0 million, which is based on open market trading activity provided by a third party for our Senior Notes and based on rates offered for similar arrangements for our mortgage indebtedness.

Credit Risk

As a result of our spin off of Kindred in 1998, we have a significant
concentration of credit risk with Kindred under the Kindred Master Leases. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, Kindred accounted for $192.4 million, or 81.2% of our total revenues, and $182.0, or 93.5% of our total revenues,
respectively. Accordingly, Kindred’s financial condition and ability to meet our rent obligations will largely determine our rental revenues and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, any failure by Kindred to
effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Arising from Our Business—We are dependent
on Kindred; Kindred’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders
as required to continue to qualify as a REIT” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “Note 4—Concentration of Credit Risk” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We monitor our credit risk
under our lease agreements with our tenants by, among other things, (i) reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally, publicly available information regarding tenants, and information provided by the tenants and
borrowers under our lease and other agreements, and (ii) having periodic discussions with tenants, borrowers and their representatives.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During 2004, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from equity and debt issuances, cash flow from operations, borrowings under revolving credit
facilities and disposition of real estate assets, proceeds from stock option exercises, and proceeds from the Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. We anticipate that cash flow from operations over the next twelve months will be
adequate to fund our business operations, dividends to shareholders and debt amortization. Capital requirements for acquisitions may require funding from borrowings, assumption of debt from the seller, issuance of secured or unsecured long-term debt
or other securities or equity offerings.

We intend to continue
to fund future investments through cash flow from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, disposition of assets and issuance of secured or unsecured long-term debt or other securities. As of December 31, 2004, we had cash and
cash equivalents of $3.4 million, escrow deposits and restricted cash of $25.7 million (comprised of $5.0 million of reserves under the CMBS Loan (as defined below), $11.2 million that we paid into escrow as required under our mortgage agreements, a
deposit of $9.5 million in connection with an IRS Section 1031 Exchange), and unused revolving credit availability of $251.3 million under our revolving credit facility.



Index to Financial Statements

CMBS Transaction

On December 12, 2001, we raised $225.0 million in gross proceeds from the completion of a commercial mortgage backed
securitization transaction (the “CMBS Loan”). As of December 31, 2004, the CMBS Loan bears interest at a weighted average of LIBOR plus 1.4935%, with principal and interest payable monthly. The CMBS Loan matures on December 9, 2006, at
which time a principal balloon payment of approximately $206.4 million will be due, assuming all scheduled amortization payments are made and no prepayments are made. The CMBS Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time and from time to time
without penalty or premium.

The CMBS Loan is secured by liens
on 39 skilled nursing facilities transferred by Ventas Realty to Ventas Finance I, LLC (“Ventas Finance”) and leased to Kindred under a Kindred Master Lease (the “Kindred CMBS Master Lease”). Except for certain customary
exceptions, the CMBS Loan is non-recourse to Ventas Finance and us. See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revolving Credit Facility

We obtained a new $300.0 million revolving credit facility in September 2004 that replaced our previous revolving credit facility. The revolving credit
facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a percentage ranging 1.05% to 1.75%, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2004, borrowings under the revolving credit facility were bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.25%. We also incur
an annual facility fee of 25 basis points payable in quarterly installments. The borrowing rate on the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2004 was approximately 3.65%. Initial borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to
refinance all of the amounts outstanding under our previous revolving credit facility and pay off the $60.0 million term loan under our previous revolving credit facility (the “Tranche B Term Loan”). Our current revolving credit facility
matures in September 2007, subject to a one-year extension.

The outstanding aggregate principal balance of the revolving credit facility may not exceed either (a) the borrowing base (as described below) or (b) $300.0 million. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding principal balance under the
revolving credit facility (excluding outstanding letters of credit of $0.5 million) was $39.0 million and there was no term loan. Subject to the terms of the revolving credit facility, we have the option to increase our borrowing capacity to an
amount not to exceed $450.0 million.

As of December 31, 2004,
the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility was $290.8 million. The borrowing base is the sum of (i) sixty-five percent (65%) of the aggregate appraised property value of the borrowing base properties, plus (ii) 100% of amounts on deposit
in certain cash collateral or pledged accounts. The borrowing base properties are currently comprised of 44 owned or leased real properties, which are also mortgaged to secure the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2004, the borrowing
base properties had a net book value of $113.5 million and were leased to Kindred pursuant to Master Lease No. 1.

The agreement relating to the revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictive covenants. See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Senior
Notes Offering

In October 2004, we completed the offering
of 6


/


% Senior Notes due October 15, 2014 of our subsidiaries, Ventas Realty and Ventas Capital Corporation
(“the Issuers”), in the aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million (the “2014 Senior Notes”). In April 2002, we completed the offering of 8


/


% Senior Notes due May 1, 2009 of the Issuers in the aggregate principal amount of $175.0 million (the “2009 Senior Notes”) and 9% Senior Notes due May 1, 2012 of the
Issuers, in the aggregate principal amount of $225.0 million (the “2012 Senior Notes” and, together with the 2009 Senior Notes and the 2014 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”). On December 31, 2002, we purchased $0.8 million
principal amount of 2009 Senior Notes and $33.2 million principal amount of 2012 Senior Notes in open market transactions. As of December 31, 2004, $125.0 million principal amount of 2014 Senior Notes, $174.2 million principal amount of 2009 Senior
Notes and $191.8 million principal amount of 2012 Senior Notes were outstanding. We and certain of our subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Senior Notes.



Index to Financial Statements

Pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the 2014 Senior Notes
offering, on January 28, 2005, we completed an offer to exchange the 2014 Senior Notes with a new series of notes that are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and are otherwise substantially identical to the outstanding 2014
Senior Notes, except that certain transfer restrictions, registration rights and liquidated damages do not apply to the new notes. We did not receive any additional proceeds in connection with the exchange offer.

The Senior Notes are subject to a number of restrictive covenants. See
“Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Dividends

In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of REIT taxable income (excluding net
capital gain). We declared dividends greater than 100% of estimated taxable income for 2004 and intend to pay a dividend greater than 100% of taxable income for 2005.

We expect that REIT taxable income will be less than cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non-cash
deductions in computing REIT taxable income. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, it is possible that from time to time we may not have
sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. If we do not have sufficient cash or liquid
assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in
a transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements.

Capital Expenditures and Property Acquisitions

Except with respect to our medical office buildings, capital expenditures to maintain and improve the leased properties generally will be incurred by our tenants. Accordingly, we do not believe that we will incur any
major expenditures in connection with the leased properties. After the expiration of the leases, or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under the leases, we anticipate that any expenditures relating to the
maintenance of leased properties for which we may become responsible will be funded by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings. To the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity
may be affected adversely. Our ability to make expenditures and borrow funds is restricted by the terms of our revolving credit facility and the Senior Notes.

Shelf Registration Statement and Equity Offering

On June 19, 2002, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to $750.0 million of
common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares and warrants. The registration statement became effective on July 8, 2002.

On March 15, 2004, we completed the sale of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering under the shelf registration
statement. We received $51.1 million in net proceeds from the sale, which we used to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions. As of December 31, 2004, $599.1
million of securities remained available for offering under the shelf registration statement.

During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002, we completed the sale of 9,000,000 shares of our common stock in a joint equity offering with Tenet Healthcare Corporation (“Tenet”). In the offering, Tenet
sold all 8,301,067 shares of our common stock that it held. Our net proceeds from the sale were $93.6 million, which we used to repay outstanding indebtedness, including the indebtedness incurred by us to invest in transactions with THI.

Other

In 2004, we assumed facility level mortgage debt in connection with acquisitions of certain facilities and the ElderTrust merger. Outstanding facility
level mortgage debt was approximately $100.5 million as of December 31, 2004. See “Note 6—Mergers and Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2000, we recorded a $96.5 million charge related to the United States settlement. Under the United States settlement, we
were required to pay $103.6 million to the federal government, of which $34.0 million was paid on April 20, 2001, the date of Kindred’s emergence from bankruptcy. The balance of $69.6 million bore interest at 6% per annum and was payable in
equal quarterly installments over a five-year term commencing on June 30, 2001. The charge in the fourth quarter of 2000 was discounted for accounting purposes based on an imputed borrowing rate of 10.75%. We were required to pay $16.2 million in
principal and interest in 2003 under the United States settlement. On June 30, 2003, we prepaid in full the principal amount owed on the United States settlement. There was no prepayment penalty or other charges payable on account of the early
repayment.

We received proceeds on the exercises of stock
options in the amounts of $17.7 million and $22.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Future proceeds on the exercises of stock options are primarily affected by the future performance of our stock price and the
number of options outstanding. Options outstanding have decreased to 1.6 million as of December 31, 2004, from 2.6 million and 4.2 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

We generated net proceeds from our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan of $5.3 million during the fourth
quarter of 2004 and $13.1 million for the year ended December 31 2004. Beginning in March 2005, we are offering a 1% discount on the purchase price of our stock to shareholders who reinvest their dividends and/or make optional cash purchases of
common stock through the plan. During 2004 we offered a 2% discount. Each month or quarter, as applicable, we may lower or eliminate the discount without prior notice, thereby affecting the future proceeds that we receive from this plan.

We have outstanding loans to certain current and former executive officers
in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.2 million as of December 31, 2004, down from $3.8 million at December 31, 2003. The loans are payable over ten years beginning, in each case, on the date such loan was made. See “Note
15—Related Party Transactions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash Flows

Net cash
provided by operating activities totaled $150.0 million and $137.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2004 cash flows is primarily a result of increases due to rent escalators and additional rent
net of interest expense relating to the properties acquired during 2004.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $298.7 million. We invested $323.7 million in real property which was financed through borrowings under the revolving credit facility and
cash on hand and sold two facilities for proceeds of $21.1 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $159.7 million. We received $139.2 million in proceeds from the disposal of real estate properties
and $20.2 million in proceeds from the sale of the Kindred common stock. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $34.1 million. We made a net investment in transactions with THI of $68.9 million, received $28.6
million in proceeds from the disposal of real estate properties, and received $7.0 million in proceeds from the sale of the Kindred common stock.

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $70.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The proceeds included (i) $125.0 million from the
issuance of the 2014 Senior Notes, (ii) $64.2 million from the issuance of common stock; (iii) $39.0 million from net borrowings on the revolving credit facility and (iv) $17.7 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock
options. The uses included (i) an aggregate principal payment of $67.0 million on our Tranche B Term Loan, CMBS Loan and other mortgage loans, and (ii) $103.5 million of cash dividend payments.



Index to Financial Statements

Net cash used in financing activities totaled $217.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
uses included (i) an aggregate principal payment of $67.1 million on our revolving credit facility and the CMBS Loan, (ii) $37.4 million payment in 2003 for the settlement of the repurchase of the Senior Notes that occurred on December 31, 2002,
(iii) $8.6 million in swap breakage fees, (iv) full repayment on the United States settlement of $46.6 million and (v) $80.2 million of cash dividend payments. The uses were offset by $22.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon
of exercise of stock options.

Net cash used in financing
totaled $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The uses include (i) a net of $106.7 million payment of principal on our revolving credit facility and the CMBS Loan, (ii) $15.1 million in financing fees, (iii) $12.8 million in swap
breakage costs, (iv) $50.1 million of cash dividend payments, and (v) $10.8 million of principal payments on the United States settlement. The uses were offset by net proceeds of $97.2 million from the issuance of common stock including the net
proceeds of $93.6 million from the issuance of nine million shares and $3.6 million from the exercise of stock options.

On December 31, 2002, we repurchased through open market purchases $0.8 million principal amount of 2009 Senior Notes and $33.2 million principal amount
of 2012 Senior Notes. The total purchase price aggregated $37.4 million. As a result of these purchases, we reported a loss from the extinguishment of debt of $4.2 million in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes the effect that minimum debt (which includes principal and interest payments) and other
material noncancelable commitments are expected to have on our cash flow in the future periods (in thousands).

(1)

Amounts represent contractual amounts due, including interest.

(2)

Interest on variable rate debt and obligations under the interest rate swap were based on forward rates obtained as of December 31, 2004.

(3)

Includes a $206.4 million balloon payment due December 2006 on the CMBS Loan.

(4)

Includes $174.2 million outstanding principal amount of the 2009 Senior Notes.

(5)

Includes $191.8 million outstanding principal amount of the 2012 Senior Notes, and $125.0 million of the 2014 Senior Notes.

In connection with the Kindred spin off, we assigned our former third-party
lease obligations and third-party guarantee agreements to Kindred. As of December 31, 2004, we believe that the aggregate exposure under our third-party lease obligations was approximately $26.0 million and that we have no material exposure under
the third-party guarantee agreements. Kindred has agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against all claims against us arising out of the third-party leases, and we do not expect to incur any liability under those leases. However, we
cannot assure you that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy, or that it will continue to honor its obligations under the indemnity agreement relating to the third-party leases. See “Note
11—Commitments and Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Ventas, Inc. (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. The Company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

Management, under the supervision of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 was effective. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Therefore, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation and may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, has been
audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Stockholders and Board of Directors

Ventas, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ventas, Inc. as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index. These financial statements and schedule are
the responsibility of our management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Ventas, Inc. at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Ventas, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

As discussed in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt in 2003 and changed its method of accounting for disposal of long-lived assets in 2002.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Ventas, Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Ventas, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, and the financial statement schedule listed in the index of Ventas, Inc. and our report dated February 22,
2005, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1—Description of Business

Ventas,
Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, except where the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us” or “our”) is a healthcare real estate investment trust (“REIT”) with a geographically diverse portfolio of
healthcare and senior housing facilities. As of December 31, 2004, this portfolio consisted of 201 skilled nursing facilities, 40 hospitals, 30 senior housing facilities and 16 other facilities in 39 states. Except with respect to our medical office
buildings, we lease these facilities to healthcare operating companies under “triple-net” or “absolute net” leases. Kindred Healthcare, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Kindred”) leased 225 of our facilities as
of December 31, 2004. We also have real estate loan investments relating to 25 healthcare and senior housing facilities as of December 31, 2004.

We conduct substantially all of our business through a wholly owned operating partnership, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership (“Ventas Realty”),
a wholly owned limited liability company, Ventas Finance I, LLC (“Ventas Finance”), and an operating partnership, ElderTrust Operating Partnership (“ETOP”), in which we own 99.6% of the partnership units.

Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), which is a revision to SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (“SFAS No. 123”). SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB Opinion No. 25”). Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R)
is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123, except that SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro
forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under SFAS No. 123(R).

As required under SFAS No. 123(R), we expect to adopt the provisions of this accounting standard on July 1, 2005. We expect to apply the modified prospective method of adoption in which compensation cost is recognized beginning on the
date we adopt the accounting standard for all share-based payments granted after the adoption date and for all awards granted to employees prior to the adoption date that remain unvested on the adoption date. As permitted by SFAS No. 123(R), we
currently account for share-based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25 and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) is expected to
result in an immaterial increase in expense during the second half of 2005 based on unvested options outstanding as of December 31, 2004 and current compensation plans. While the effect of adoption depends on the level of share-based payments
granted in the future and unvested grants on the date we adopt SFAS No. 123(R), the effect of this accounting standard on our prior operating results would approximate the effect of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income
and earnings per share. See “Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity and Stock Options”.

In April 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Correction” (“SFAS No. 145”). SFAS No. 4, “Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt” (“SFAS No. 4”), required that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt that were included in the
determination of net income be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 that related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 required us to reclassify certain prior period items that no longer meet the
extraordinary classification into continuing operations. Additionally, future gains and losses related to debt extinguishment may be required to be classified as income from continuing operations. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 related to the
rescission of

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

SFAS No. 4 became effective in fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. As required, on January 1, 2003 we adopted SFAS No. 145. In accordance with SFAS
No. 145, our prior year financial statements have been reclassified to include gains and losses from extinguishment of debt in continuing operations. This reclassification has no effect on our net income.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ventas, Inc.
and all of its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and ETOP. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of rental revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Segment Reporting

We have one primary
reportable segment, which consists of investment in real estate. Our primary business is financing, owning and leasing healthcare-related and senior housing facilities and leasing or subleasing such facilities to third parties, primarily Kindred.
See “Note 4—Concentration of Credit Risk.” Substantially all of our leases are triple-net leases, which require the tenants to pay all property-related expenses. With the exception of our medical office buildings, we do not operate
our facilities nor do we allocate capital to maintain the properties. Substantially all depreciation and interest expenses, except for interest expense relating to the United States Settlement (as defined in “Note 11—Commitments and
Contingencies—Settlement of United States Claims”), reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income relate to the ownership of our investment in real estate.

Discontinued Operations

The results of operations and gain/(loss) on real estate properties sold or held for sale are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as
“discontinued operations” for all periods presented. Interest expense allocated to discontinued operations has been estimated based on a proportional allocation of rental income among all of our facilities.

Long-Lived Assets

Investments in real estate properties are recorded at cost. We account for
acquisitions using the purchase method. The cost of the properties acquired is allocated among tangible land, buildings and equipment and recognized intangibles based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141,
“Business Combinations.” We estimate fair values of the components of assets acquired as of the acquisition date or engage a third party appraiser as necessary. Recognized intangibles, if any, include the value of acquired lease contracts
and related customer relationships.



Index to Financial Statements

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Our method for determining fair value varies with the categorization of the asset acquired. We
estimate the fair value of our buildings on an as-if-vacant basis, and amortize the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building. We determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and amortize
such value over their estimated remaining useful lives. We determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset, internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable
properties within our portfolio or third party appraisals. The fair value of in-place leases, if any, reflects (i) above and below market leases, if any, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the
in-place rentals, the resulting intangible asset of which is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods, if applicable, (ii) the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants,
including tenant allowances, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease, and (iii) an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs
foregone during a reasonable lease-up period, as if the acquired space was vacant, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease. We also estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the
nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with such tenant, such tenant’s credit quality, expectations of lease renewals with such tenant, and the potential for
significant, additional future leasing arrangements with such tenant. We amortize such value, if any, over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases, which would include the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected
renewal periods.

Depreciation for buildings is recorded on the
straight-line basis, using estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 50 years.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily consisting of our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate
investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. We adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long-lived assets to fair value, if the sum of the expected future cash flow or sales proceeds is
less than book value. An impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such adjustment. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded a $0.8 million
impairment on one non-operating skilled nursing facility. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2002, we did not recognize an impairment loss.

Loan Receivable

The loan receivable is stated at the unpaid principal balance net of deferred origination fees. Net deferred origination fees are comprised of loan fees
collected from the borrower net of certain direct costs. Net deferred origination fees are amortized over the contractual life of the loan using the level yield method. Interest income on the loans receivable is recorded as earned. We evaluate the
collectibility of the loan receivable based on, among other things (i) corporate and facility level financial and operational reports, (ii) compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the applicable loan documents and (iii) the financial
stability of the applicable borrower and any guarantor.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of
highly liquid investments with a maturity date of three months or less when purchased. These investments are stated at cost which approximates fair value.



Index to Financial Statements

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Escrow Deposits and Restricted Cash

Escrow deposits primarily consist of amounts held by lenders to provide for
future real estate tax and insurance expenditures and tenant improvements, earnest money deposits on acquisitions and net proceeds from property sales that were executed as a tax-deferred disposition. Restricted cash represents amounts committed for
various utility deposits and security deposits paid to us by third parties.

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs are amortized as a component of interest expense over the terms of the related borrowings using a method that approximates a level yield, and are net of accumulated amortization of approximately $7.3 million and
$7.4 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Derivative Instruments

As discussed in
“Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements,” we use derivative instruments to protect against the risk of interest rate movements on future cash flows under our variable rate debt agreements. Derivative instruments are reported at fair value on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of derivatives deemed to be eligible for hedge accounting are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income exclusive of ineffectiveness amounts which are reported in interest expense.
As of December 31, 2004, a $9.1 million net unrealized loss on the derivatives is included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are not eligible for hedge accounting are reported in the
Consolidated Statements of Income. See “Note 8—Fair Values of Financial Instruments.” Fair values of derivative instruments are verified with a third party consultant.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating fair value disclosures for financial instruments.

•

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates fair value because of the short maturity of
these instruments.

•

Real estate loan receivable: The fair value of loans receivable approximates net carrying value, based on rates offered for similar arrangements.

•

Notes receivable from employees: The fair values of the notes receivable from employees are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates being offered for
similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings.

•

Interest rate swap agreement: The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is based on rates being offered for similar arrangements which consider forward yield curves and
discount rates.

•

Revolving credit facilities and CMBS Loan: The fair values of borrowings under variable rate agreements approximate their carrying value.

•

Senior Notes payable: The fair values of borrowings under fixed rate agreements are estimated based on open market trading activity provided by a third party.

•

Other mortgages: The fair value of other mortgage loans approximates net carrying value, based on rates offered for similar arrangements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Comprehensive Income

SFAS No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income,” establishes guidelines for the reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components in financial statements. Comprehensive income includes net income and all other non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity during a period including unrealized gains and losses on equity securities
classified as available-for-sale and unrealized fair value adjustments on certain derivative instruments.

Revenue Recognition

Certain of our leases, excluding the Kindred Master Leases (as defined below), provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. Base rental
revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the applicable lease. Certain of our other leases, including the Kindred Master Leases, provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue
parameters or other contingencies are met. We recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other contingencies are met rather than on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable lease. We
recognize income from rent, lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 104: (i) the agreement has been fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have
been rendered; (iii) the amount is fixed or determinable; and (iv) the collectibility is reasonably assured.

Note 3—Revenues from Properties

Approximately 81.2% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 was derived from our master lease agreements with Kindred (the “Kindred Master Leases”). Each Kindred Master Lease is a
“triple-net lease” pursuant to which Kindred is required to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance and repairs related to the properties. There are several renewal bundles of properties under each Kindred Master Lease, with each
bundle containing a varying number of properties. All properties within a bundle have primary terms ranging from 10 to 15 years from May 1, 1998, subject to certain exceptions, and are subject to three five-year renewal terms.

Kindred is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) and is required to file with the Commission annual reports containing audited financial information and quarterly reports containing unaudited financial information. The information related to Kindred
provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is derived from filings made with the Commission or other publicly available information, or has been provided to us by Kindred. We have not verified this information either through an independent
investigation or by reviewing Kindred’s public filings. We have no reason to believe that such information is inaccurate in any material respect, but we cannot assure you that all of this information is accurate. Kindred’s filings with the
Commission can be found at the Commission’s website at www.sec.gov. We are providing this data for informational purposes only, and you are encouraged to obtain Kindred’s publicly available filings from the Commission.

Under each Kindred Master Lease, the aggregate annual rent is referred to as
Base Rent (as defined in each Kindred Master Lease). Base Rent escalates on May 1 of each year at an annual rate of 3.5% over the prior period Base Rent if certain Kindred revenue parameters are met. Assuming such Kindred revenue parameters are met,
annual Base Rent under the Kindred Master Leases will be $198.9 million from May 1, 2005 to April 30, 2006.

On July 1, 2003, we amended the Kindred Master Leases to increase rent on certain facilities leased to Kindred by $8.6 million per year on an annualized
basis (May 1, 2003-April 30, 2004), for approximately seven years. This amount will escalate 3.5% annually in accordance with the Kindred Master Leases.



Index to Financial Statements

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The future contracted minimum rentals, excluding rent escalations and excluding the amortization of
the value of the Kindred common stock and the $4.5 million in cash received on April 20, 2001, the date on which Kindred emerged from bankruptcy, but with straight-line rents where applicable, for all our leases are as follows:

We have a one-time
right under each Kindred Master Lease (the “Reset Right”), exercisable by notice given on or after January 20, 2006 and on or before July 19, 2007, to increase the rent to a then fair market rental rate, commencing as early as July 19,
2006, for a total fee of $4.6 million payable on a pro-rata basis at the time of exercise under the applicable Kindred Master Lease. The Reset Right generally applies on a lease-by-lease basis, except that the Reset Rights under Master Lease No. 1,
Master Lease No. 1A and the Kindred CMBS Master Lease (defined in “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements—CMBS Transaction”) can only be exercised together. If the Reset Right is exercised for any Kindred Master Lease, the annual
escalations currently applicable to that lease may be altered or reduced, depending on market conditions at the time. We believe that, based on information currently available to us and current market conditions, if we were entitled to and did
exercise the Reset Right, the rent under the Kindred Master Leases would increase, perhaps materially. However, the value of the Reset Right is dependent on a variety of factors and is highly speculative and there can be no assurances regarding the
value of the Reset Right.

Note 4—Concentration of Credit Risk

As of December 31, 2004, approximately 67.3% of our
properties, based on their original cost, were operated by Kindred and approximately 55.1% of our properties, based on their original cost, were skilled nursing facilities. Our remaining properties consist of hospitals, senior housing facilities and
other facilities. Our facilities are located in 39 states, with facilities in one state accounting for more than 10% of total revenues during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Because we lease a substantial portion of our properties to Kindred and
Kindred is the primary source of our total revenues, Kindred’s financial condition and ability and willingness to satisfy its obligations under the Kindred Master Leases and certain other agreements with us will significantly impact our
revenues and our ability to service our indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. On September 13, 1999, Kindred filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Delaware, and Kindred emerged from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001. Despite Kindred’s emergence from bankruptcy, we cannot assure you that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations
under the Kindred Master Leases or that Kindred will perform its obligations under the Kindred Master Leases. The inability or unwillingness of Kindred to satisfy its obligations under the Kindred Master Leases would have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity, on our ability to service our indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders as required to maintain our status as a REIT.

Note 5—Dispositions

In 2004, we completed the sale of two facilities for $21.1 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the
sale of $19.4 million. In addition, the tenant paid us lease termination fees approximating $0.5 million. In 2003, we completed the sale of 27 facilities for $139.2 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of $51.8 million.
In addition, the tenants paid us lease termination fees approximating $10.1 million. In 2002, we completed the sale of two facilities for $28.6 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of $23.5 million. The net gains and
lease termination fees are included in discontinued operations for the respective years in which the dispositions occurred.

As of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the net book value of the facilities sold and held for sale during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $3.2 million, $91.7
million and $5.3 million, respectively.

Set forth below is a
summary of the results of operations of the sold and held for sale facilities during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:

Note 6—Mergers and
Acquisitions

During the year ended December 31, 2004, we
completed the acquisitions described below. The primary reason for these acquisitions was to invest in healthcare and senior housing properties with an expected yield on investment, as well as to diversify our properties and revenue base and reduce
our dependence on Kindred for rental revenue.

ElderTrust
Merger

On February 5, 2004, we acquired all of the
outstanding common shares of ElderTrust, in an all cash transaction valued at $184.0 million. At the close of the ElderTrust transaction, ElderTrust had approximately $33.5 million in unrestricted and restricted cash. After transaction costs, the
net investment of the ElderTrust transaction was approximately $160.0 million. The ElderTrust transaction added 18 facilities to our portfolio. The ElderTrust properties are leased to various operators under leases having remaining terms primarily
ranging from four to 11 years and initially providing for aggregate, annual cash base rent of approximately $16.4 million, subject to escalation as provided in the leases. Concurrent with the consummation of the ElderTrust transaction, we also
purchased all of the limited partnership units in ETOP, then held by third parties at $12.50 per unit, other than 31,455 Class C Units in ETOP (which remain outstanding). ETOP owns directly or indirectly all of the ElderTrust properties. Our
ownership of the ElderTrust properties is subject to approximately $77.7 million of property-level debt as of December 31, 2004.

Brookdale Transactions

During the period from January 1, 2004 through May 12, 2004, we acquired 15 independent living or assisted living facilities
for an aggregate purchase price of $157.4 million. These facilities are leased by us to affiliates of Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. (“Brookdale”) pursuant to a master lease containing 10 properties and five separate single facility
leases, all of which are triple-net leases guaranteed by Brookdale having an initial term of 15 years and initially providing for aggregate, annual cash base rent of approximately $14.5 million, subject to annual escalation of the greater of (i) 2%
or (ii) 75% of the annual increase in the consumer price index.

Other 2004 Acquisitions

During 2004, we
acquired four senior housing facilities and two skilled nursing facilities, for an aggregate purchase price of $93.3 million. The facilities are leased under triple-net leases, having initial terms of 10 to 15 years and providing aggregate, annual
cash base rent of approximately $8.9 million, subject to escalation as provided in the leases. We also acquired five medical office buildings, for an aggregate purchase price of $15.9 million. These buildings are leased to various tenants under
leases having remaining terms ranging from four to six years and initially providing for aggregate, annual cash base rent of approximately $1.9 million, subject to escalation as provided in the leases. We have engaged managers to manage the
operations at the medical office buildings.

Estimated Fair
Value

The 2004 acquisitions were accounted for under the
purchase method. The following table summarizes the preliminary estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. Such estimates are subject to refinement as additional valuation information is
received. We are in the process of computing fair values; thus, the allocation of the purchase price is subject to refinement.

The buildings
are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which were determined to be 30 years for those acquired in the ElderTrust merger and 35 years for all other 2004 acquisitions.

Transactions with
Trans Healthcare, Inc.

On November 4, 2002, we, through
Ventas Realty completed a $120.0 million transaction with Trans Healthcare, Inc. (“THI”), a privately owned long-term care and hospital company. The transaction was structured as a $53.0 million sale-leaseback transaction and a $67.0
million loan, comprised of a first mortgage loan and a mezzanine loan. Following a sale of the $50 million THI first mortgage loan in December 2002, our investment in THI was $70.0 million.

As part of the THI sale leaseback, Ventas Realty purchased five properties
and is leasing them back to THI under a triple-net master lease. The properties subject to the sale leaseback are four skilled nursing facilities and one continuing care retirement community. The THI master lease, which has an initial term of
10 years, provides for initial annual base rent of $5.9 million. The THI master lease provides that if THI meets specified revenue parameters, annual base rent will escalate each year by the greater of (i) 3% or (ii) 50% of the consumer price index.

THI remains current on all of its payment obligations to us,
although we have entered into several forbearance agreements with THI regarding certain non-financial terms of its agreements with us. As of February 15, 2005, the balance of the mezzanine loan was $12.4 million. The THI mezzanine loan bears
interest, inclusive of upfront fees, at 18% per annum and is secured by equity pledges in entities that own and operate the 17 healthcare facilities that also collateralize the THI first mortgage loan, plus liens on four other healthcare properties,
and interests in three additional properties and a physical therapy business.

Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements

The following is a summary of our long-term debt and certain interest rate and maturity information as of December 31, 2004
and 2003:

CMBS Loan

On December 12, 2001, we raised $225.0 million in gross
proceeds from the completion of a commercial mortgage backed securitization transaction (the “CMBS Transaction”). Under a Loan and Security Agreement dated as of December 12, 2001 (the “CMBS Loan Agreement”), Ventas Finance
obtained a loan in the principal amount of $225.0 million (the “CMBS Loan”) from Merrill Lynch Mortgage Lending, Inc., as lender (the “CMBS Lender”). The CMBS Loan is comprised of six components (i) a component in the original
principal amount of $125,230,000 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.8665%; (ii) a component in the original principal amount of $17,970,000 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.1665%; (iii) a component in the original principal amount of
$8,860,000 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.5165%; (iv) a component in the original principal amount of $26,830,000 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.9665%; (v) a component in the original principal amount of $26,830,000 which bears interest
at LIBOR plus 2.6665%; and (vi) a component in the original principal amount of $19,280,000 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.1665%. Principal of and interest on the CMBS Loan is payable monthly. Principal payments on the CMBS Loan were
calculated based upon a 25-year amortization schedule using an assumed interest rate of 9.46% per annum. The CMBS Loan matures on December 9, 2006, at which time a principal balloon payment of approximately $206.4 million will be due, assuming all
scheduled amortization payments are made and no prepayments are made on the CMBS Loan. The CMBS Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time and from time to time without penalty or premium.

The CMBS Loan is secured by liens on 39 skilled nursing facilities
transferred by Ventas Realty to Ventas Finance and leased to Kindred under a Kindred Master Lease (the “Kindred CMBS Master Lease”). Except for certain customary exceptions, the CMBS Loan is non-recourse to Ventas Finance and us.

Ventas Finance is required to maintain or cause to be
maintained various reserve accounts under the CMBS Loan Agreement including a debt service reserve, an imposition and insurance reserve and a replacement reserve account. The impositions and insurance reserve and the replacement reserve under the
CMBS Loan Agreement are being funded and/or maintained by Kindred as required under and in accordance with the terms of the Kindred CMBS Master Lease. If Kindred should be unwilling or unable to fund these reserves under the CMBS Loan Agreement,
Ventas Finance will be required to fund and/or maintain such reserves. Restricted cash at December 31, 2004 included $5.0 million related to the debt service reserve account for the CMBS Loan.

Monthly rental amounts under the Kindred CMBS Master Lease are deposited directly by Kindred into a
central account for the benefit of the CMBS Lender. After application to monthly principal and interest payments and the reserve accounts, the central account is swept on a daily basis to Ventas Finance. However, during the continuance of an event
of default or a Cash Flow Sweep Event, as defined in the CMBS Loan Agreement, all amounts in the central account in excess of the current month’s principal and interest payment and the required reserve payments will be deposited into an account
and applied as a prepayment of the CMBS Loan on the next monthly payment date.

Revolving Credit Facility

On September 8, 2004, we entered into a three-year revolving credit facility totaling $300 million which replaced our previous revolving credit facility. Subject to certain conditions, we may extend the revolving credit facility for one
year and increase our borrowing capacity to an amount not to exceed $450.0 million. Generally, borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility bears interest at a fluctuating LIBOR-based rate per annum plus an applicable percentage
ranging from 1.05% to 1.75% depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. The applicable percentage was 1.25% at December 31, 2004. The previous revolving credit facility included borrowings bearing interest at a fluctuating LIBOR-based rate and the
Tranche B Term Loan. The Tranche B Term Loan bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% and was due April 2007. Ventas Realty is the borrower and we are guarantors under the revolving credit facility.

Obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by liens on
certain of Ventas Realty’s real property assets and any related leases, rents and personal property, and, at Ventas Realty’s option, may be secured by certain cash collateral. Currently, 44 real properties owned or leased by Ventas Realty
are mortgaged to secure the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2004, the net book value of these properties was $113.5 million. As of December 31, 2004, the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility was $290.8 million, the
aggregate principal balance of outstanding obligations (excluding outstanding letters of credit of $0.5 million) was $39.0 million and the remaining availability was $251.3 million.

We incurred losses on extinguishment of debt in the amounts of $1.4 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December
31, 2004 and 2002, respectively, representing the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to previous revolving credit facilities and early extinguishment premium on the 2009 Senior Notes and 2012 Senior Notes (as each term is
defined below).

The revolving credit facility contains a
number of restrictive covenants, including, without limitation, covenants pertaining to (i) the incurrence of additional indebtedness; (ii) limitations on liens; (iii) customary restrictions on certain dividends, distributions and other payments
(the sum of all restricted payments made by us after April 17, 2002 cannot exceed 95% of our aggregate cumulative funds from operations (“FFO”)); (iv) mergers, sales of assets and other transactions; (v) requirements regarding the
maintenance of certain (a) consolidated leverage ratios, (b) consolidated fixed charge coverage ratios and (c) consolidated adjusted net worth; (vi) transactions with affiliates; (vii) permitted business and development activities and uses of
loan proceeds; and (viii) changes to material agreements. The revolving credit facility contains various potential events of default and is, among other things, cross-defaulted with certain other indebtedness and obligations of Ventas Realty.

Senior Notes

On April 17, 2002, Ventas Realty and Ventas Capital Corporation, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Ventas Realty (collectively, the “Issuers”), completed the offering of 8

principal amount of $225.0 million (the “2012 Senior Notes”). On October 15, 2004, the Issuers completed the offering of 6


/


% Senior Notes due 2014 in the aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million (the “2014 Senior Notes” and
together with the 2009 Senior Notes and the 2012 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes were issued under separate indentures, and mature on May 1, 2009, May 1, 2012, and October 15, 2014, respectively.

The Senior Notes are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a
senior unsecured basis by us and by certain of our current and future subsidiaries as described in the indentures (collectively, the “Guarantors”). The Senior Notes are part of our general unsecured obligations, rank equal in right of
payment with all of our existing and future senior obligations and rank senior to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness. However, the Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to all borrowings under our revolving credit facility
with respect to the assets securing obligations under the facility. In addition, the Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to the CMBS Loan.

The Issuers may redeem the 2009 Senior Notes and the 2012 Senior Notes in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date and a make-whole premium described in the applicable indenture. The Issuers may redeem the 2014 Senior Notes in whole at any time, or in part from
time to time, (i) prior to October 15, 2009 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a make-whole premium described in the applicable indenture and (ii) on or after October 15, 2009 at varying redemption prices set
forth in the applicable indenture, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. In addition, the Issuers may redeem up to 35% of the 2014 Senior Notes prior to October 15, 2007 with the net cash proceeds from
certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 106.625% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.

If we experience certain kinds of changes of control, the Issuers must make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes, in
whole or in part, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase; provided, however, that in the event Moody’s and S&P have confirmed their
ratings at Ba3 or higher and BB- or higher on the Senior Notes and certain other conditions are met, this repurchase obligation will not apply.

The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries (collectively, the
“Restricted Group”) to, among other things: (i) incur debt; (ii) incur secured debt; (iii) make certain dividends, distributions and investments (the sum of all restricted payments made by us cannot exceed 95% of our aggregate cumulative
FFO from April 2002); (iv) enter into certain transactions, including transactions with affiliates; (v) subject our subsidiaries to restrictions on dividends or other payments to us; (vi) merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of
the Restricted Group’s assets; and (vii) sell assets. The Restricted Group is also required to maintain total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of the Restricted Group’s unsecured debt.

On December 31, 2002, we purchased $0.8 million principal amount of 2009
Senior Notes and $33.2 million principal amount of 2012 Senior Notes in open market transactions. The total purchase price aggregated $37.4 million. As a result of these purchases, we reported a loss on extinguishment of debt of $4.2 million in the
fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002.

Other Mortgages

We have outstanding 16 other mortgage loans that we
assumed in connection with the acquisition of properties or the ElderTrust merger. Outstanding principal balances on these loans ranges from $0.2 million to



Index to Financial Statements

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

$13.0 million as of December 31, 2004. The loans bear interest at fixed rates ranging 6.2% to 8.5%, except with respect to one loan with an outstanding
principal balance of $8.9 million, which bears interest at the lender’s variable rate 2.0% as of December 31, 2004. The fixed rate debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 7.5% as of December 31, 2004. The loans have a weighted average
maturity of 14 years as of December 31, 2004.

Scheduled
Maturities of Borrowing Arrangements

As of December 31,
2004, our indebtedness has the following maturities (in thousands):

Derivatives and
Hedging

In the normal course of business, we are exposed
to the effect of interest rate changes. We limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used primarily to fix the rate on debt based
on floating-rate indices and to manage the cost of borrowing obligations. We currently have an interest rate swap to manage interest rate risk (the “2003-2008 Swap”). We prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative
purposes. Further, we have a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivative is
designed to hedge, we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.

In 1998, we entered into an $800.0 million notional amount interest rate swap (the “1998 Swap”) that was treated as a cash flow hedge. In 1999,
we shortened the maturity of the 1998 Swap in exchange for a payment to us of $21.6 million, which was recorded as other comprehensive income. We began amortizing this deferred gain out of accumulated other comprehensive income in July 2003, the
amended expiration date of the 1998 Swap, and will continue such amortization through December 2007, the original expiration date of the 1998 Swap. As a result of debt refinancing in 2002, we reduced the notional amount of the 1998 Swap in exchange
for a payment to the counterparty from us of $12.8 million. This partial swap breakage cost and $7.4 million of the deferred gain were recognized as a net expense of $5.4 million in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December
31, 2002.

In 2001, we entered into the 2003-2008 Swap in the
notional amount of $450.0 million to hedge floating-rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008, under which we pay a fixed rate at 5.385% and receive LIBOR from the counterparty to the agreement. The 2003-2008 Swap is treated as
a cash flow hedge. On December 11, 2003, we received unanticipated cash proceeds from the sale of various facilities to Kindred, thereby reducing our expected future variable rate debt balances. Accordingly, we entered into an agreement with the
counterparty to break $120.0 million of the notional amount in exchange for a payment from us of approximately $8.6 million. This partial swap breakage cost and $3.4 million of the deferred gain were recognized as a net expense of $5.2 million in
the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2003.



Index to Financial Statements

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Amortization of the deferred gain in accumulated other comprehensive income was $2.3 million and $1.5
million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, the remaining deferred gain in accumulated other comprehensive income was $6.9 million.

Unrealized gains and losses on the 2003-2008 Swap are recorded as other comprehensive income. The amounts reclassified into
interest expense due to the swaps for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $13.3 million, $19.2 million and $24.7 million, respectively. Assuming no changes in interest rates, we estimate that approximately $7.7 million of the
current balance recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized as interest expense within the next twelve months consistent with historical reporting. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, $0.5 million, $0.3
million and $1.9 million, respectively, of the unrealized loss on the swaps previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive income was reclassified to interest expense to reflect the excess of the notional amount of the swaps over the
anticipated variable rate debt balances in the future.

There
are no collateral requirements under the 2003-2008 Swap. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of the non-performance by the counterparty to an interest rate swap agreement. However, we do not anticipate non-performance by the counterparty. The
notional amount of the 2003-2008 Swap is $330.0 million and is scheduled to decline as follows:

At December 31, 2004,
the 2003-2008 Swap was reported at its fair value of $16.5 million in liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The offsetting entry is reported as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Note 8—Fair Values of Financial Instruments

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the carrying amounts and fair values of
our financial instruments were as follows:

Fair value estimates
are subjective in nature and depend on a number of important assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows, risks, discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument. The use of different
market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market
exchange.

Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity and Stock Options

We have five plans under which options to purchase common stock have been,
or may be, granted to officers, employees and non-employee directors, one plan under which executive officers may receive common stock in lieu of compensation and two plans under which certain directors may receive common stock in lieu of director
fees (the following are collectively referred to as the “Plans”): (1) the 1987 Incentive Compensation Program (Employee Plan); (2) the 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan); (3) the 1987 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee
Directors; (4) the 2004 Stock Plan for Directors; (5) the TheraTx, Incorporated 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan; (6) the Executive Deferred Stock Compensation Plan; (7) the Common Stock Purchase Plan for Directors (the “Directors Stock
Purchase Plan”); and (8) the Nonemployee Director Deferred Stock Compensation Plan.

Under the Plans (other than the Executive Deferred Stock Compensation Plan, Directors Stock Purchase Plan and Nonemployee Director Deferred Stock Compensation Plan), options are exercisable at the market price on the
date of grant, expire ten years from the date of grant, and vest over varying periods ranging from one to four years. We have also granted options and restricted stock to certain officers, employees and non-employee directors outside of the Plans.
The options and shares of restricted stock that have been granted outside the Plans vest over varying periods and the options are exercisable at the market price on the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant. As of December 31,
2004, options for 1,579,769 shares had been granted to eligible participants and remained outstanding (including options granted prior to our spin off of Kindred in 1998 and held by Kindred employees) under the Plans. As of December 31, 2004,
options for 38,000 shares had been granted outside of the Plans to certain employees and non-employee directors and remained outstanding. We granted 68,271, 157,934, and 200,634 shares of restricted stock for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. The market value of the restricted shares on the date of the award has been recorded as unearned compensation on restricted stock, with the unamortized balance shown as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.
Unearned compensation is amortized to expense over the vesting period, with charges to operations of approximately $1.2 million in 2004, $1.3 million in 2003 and $1.9 million in 2002.

New option and restricted stock grants and stock issuances may only be made under the 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan
(Employee Plan), the Executive Deferred Stock Compensation Plan, the 2004 Stock Plan for Directors, the Directors Stock Purchase Plan and the Nonemployee Director Deferred Stock Compensation Plan. Under the terms of the 2000 Incentive Compensation
Plan (Employee Plan), 5,620,000 shares are reserved for grants to be issued to employees. Under the terms of the Executive Deferred Stock Compensation Plan, 500,000 shares are reserved for issuance to our executive officers in lieu of the payment of
all or a portion of their salary, at their option. Under the terms of the 2004 Stock Plan for Directors, 200,000 shares are reserved for grants or issuance to the chairman of the board and non-employee directors. Under the terms of the Directors
Stock Purchase Plan, 200,000 shares are reserved for issuance to the chairman of the board and non-employee directors in lieu of the payment of all or a portion of their retainer and meeting fees, at their option. Under the terms of the Nonemployee
Deferred Stock Compensation Plan, 500,000 shares are reserved for issuance to nonemployee directors in lieu of the payment of all or a portion of their retainer and meeting fees, at their option. As of December 31, 2004, the number of shares
available for future grants or issuance under the 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan), the Executive Deferred Stock Compensation Plan, the 2004 Stock Plan for Directors, the Directors Stock Purchase Plan and the Nonemployee Director
Deferred Stock Compensation Plan were 1,243,970, 500,000, 217,250, 164,278 and 497,486, respectively. No additional grants are permitted under the 1987 Incentive Compensation Program, the 1987 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors or the
TheraTx, Incorporated 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan. As a result, the shares reserved under these three Plans equal the options outstanding under such Plans. As of December 31, 2004, we had reserved 211,244 shares for issuance under these
Plans.

In 1995, FASB issued SFAS No. 123. This standard prescribes a fair value based method of accounting
for employee stock options or similar equity instruments and requires certain pro forma disclosures. For purposes of the pro forma disclosures required under SFAS No. 123, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the
option’s vesting period. The estimated fair value of options granted for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $824,700, $235,500, and $337,100, respectively.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per
share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, to all stock-based employee compensation.

In determining the
estimated fair value of our stock options as of the date of grant, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

The Black-Scholes
option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions,
including the expected stock price volatility. Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, in our opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options.

Note 10—Income Taxes

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code commencing with the year that ended December 31, 1999.
We intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to enable it to qualify as a REIT. Our actual qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, distribution levels, stock ownership, and the various
qualification tests. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, our tax treatment of distributions was as follows:

No net provision for
income taxes has been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 due to our belief that we qualified as a REIT and the distribution of more than 100% of our 2004 and 2003 taxable income as a
dividend. In the third quarter of 2002, we filed our 2001 federal tax return on which we elected to apply certain 2002 dividend payments in excess of our 2002 taxable net income. As a result, we recorded a $2.2 million tax benefit for 2002.

The 2002 benefit for income taxes consists of the following
(in thousands):

We believe we have met
the annual distribution requirement by payment of at least 90% of our estimated taxable income for 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Net taxable income for federal income tax purposes results from net income for financial reporting purposes adjusted for the differences between the
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, including depreciation, prepaid rent, impairment losses on real estate, the United States Settlement liability, and the interest rate swap agreement. The net difference between tax bases
of our asset and liabilities for federal income tax purposes was $91.9 and $119.2 million more than the book bases of those assets and liabilities for financial reporting for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

We made no income tax payments for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002.

As a former C corporation for federal income tax
purposes, we potentially remain subject to corporate level taxes for any asset dispositions for the period January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2008 (“built-in gains tax”). The amount of income potentially subject to this special corporate
level tax is generally equal to (a) the excess of



Index to Financial Statements

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

the fair value of the asset as of December 31, 1998 over its adjusted tax basis as of December 31, 1998, or (b) the actual amount of gain, whichever of (a)
and (b) is lower. Some but not all future gains could be offset by available net operating losses. The deferred income tax liability of $30.4 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003 reflects a previously established liability to be utilized for any
built-in gains tax incurred on assets that are disposed of prior to January 1, 2009.

In connection with the Kindred plan of reorganization, we entered into an agreement with Kindred to deposit into a third-party escrow account certain income tax refunds received by either Kindred or us. This agreement
also amended and supplemented the agreement under which Kindred has indemnified us for certain tax liabilities relating to May 1, 1998. Under the terms of this agreement any excess Escrow Funds remaining after no further claims may be made by
governmental authorities with respect to Subject Taxes or Subject Refunds (because of the expiration of statutes of limitation or otherwise) will be distributed equally to Kindred and us. At December 31, 2004, approximately $0.2 million of disputed
Subject Refunds and accrued interest, representing 50% of the Escrow Funds, is recognized in restricted cash and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

On April 1, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) notified us that it had completed its review of our federal
income tax returns for the 1997 and 1998 tax periods. The Joint Committee on Taxation affirmed the IRS Revenue Agent’s report concluding that we (1) do not owe any additional taxes for those periods, (2) are entitled to retain the approximately
$26.0 million federal tax refund we received in 2000 for those periods (the “Original Federal Refund Amount”), and (3) are entitled to receive an additional refund of $1.2 million for those periods (the “Additional Federal Refund
Amount”). In addition, as a result of the completion of the audit, we will retain substantially all of our favorable tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards.

As a result of the Joint Committee on Taxation’s findings, on April 3,
2003, we and Kindred agreed to disburse $13.5 million to each company from a previously established escrow account (the “Tax Refund Escrow”). The Tax Refund Escrow held the Original Federal Refund Amount and certain other tax refunds
(collectively, the “Tax Refund Escrow Funds”) related to periods ending in years prior to or including the date of the 1998 spin off. As a result of the Additional Federal Refund Amount and other state and local refunds, in October 2003
and September 2004 Ventas and Kindred agreed to disburse $1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively, to each company from the Tax Refund Escrow. As of December 31, 2004, our share of the amounts currently held in the Tax Refund Escrow was
approximately $0.2 million.

In 2003, we reported an increase
of approximately $20.2 million to our operating results, reflecting the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability. A portion of this contingent liability included our share of the Tax Refund Escrow Funds reported in Other
Liabilities—Disputed Federal, State and Local Tax Refunds on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The other portion of this contingent liability was previously recorded in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet to take into account the uncertainties surrounding the outcome of the IRS audit for our 1997 and 1998 tax periods as well as other federal, state, local, franchise and miscellaneous tax items. As in certain prior periods, the IRS is currently
reviewing our federal income tax return for the year ended December 31, 2001. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the total contingent liability was $1.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively.

We have a net operating loss carryforward of $10.2 million at December 31,
2004. This amount can be used to offset future taxable income (and/or taxable income for prior years if audits of any prior year’s return determine that amounts are owed), if any, remaining after the dividends paid deduction. We will be
entitled to utilize NOLs and tax credit carryforwards only to the extent that REIT taxable income exceeds our deduction for dividends paid. The NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2018. The availability of the carryforwards are subject to the
results of the ongoing IRS examination for the prior tax years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

As a result of the uncertainties relating to the ultimate utilization of favorable tax attributes
described above, no net deferred tax benefit has been ascribed to net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The IRS may challenge our entitlement to these tax attributes during its review of the tax returns for the previous
tax years. We believe we are entitled to these tax attributes, but there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters.

Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies

Agreement of Indemnity—Third-Party Leases

In connection with our spin off of Kindred in 1998 (the “1998 Spin Off”), we assigned our former third-party lease obligations (i.e., leases
under which an unrelated third party is the landlord) as a tenant or as a guarantor of tenant obligations to Kindred (the “Third-Party Leases”). Under the terms of an indemnity agreement relating to the Third-Party Leases, Kindred agreed
to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against all claims against us arising out of the Third-Party Leases assigned by us to Kindred. Either prior to or following the 1998 Spin Off, the tenant’s rights under a subset of the Third-Party
Leases were assigned or sublet to third parties unrelated to Kindred. If Kindred or such third-party subtenants are unable to or do not satisfy the obligations under any Third-Party Lease, the lessors may claim that we remain liable under the
Third-Party Leases. We believe we may have valid legal defenses to any such claim. However, there can be no assurance we would prevail against a claim brought by a lessor under a Third-Party Lease. In the event that a lessor should prevail in a
claim against us, we may be entitled to receive revenues from those properties that would mitigate the costs incurred in connection with the satisfaction of such obligations. The Third-Party Leases relating to nursing facilities, hospitals, offices
and warehouses have remaining terms (excluding renewal periods) of one to 10 years. The Third-Party Leases relating to ground leases have remaining terms from one to 80 years. Under Kindred’s plan of reorganization, Kindred assumed and agreed
to fulfill its obligations under the indemnity agreement relating to the Third-Party Leases. There can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy, or that it will continue to
honor, its obligations under the indemnity agreement relating to the Third-Party Leases. Under Kindred’s plan of reorganization, Kindred has agreed not to renew or extend any Third-Party Lease unless it first obtains a release of us from
liability under such Third-Party Lease.

The total aggregate
remaining minimum rental payments under the Third-Party Leases are as follows:

Agreement of
Indemnity—Third-Party Guarantees

In connection with
the 1998 Spin Off, we assigned our former third-party guaranty agreements to Kindred (the “Third-Party Guarantees”). Under the terms of an indemnity agreement relating to the Third-Party Guarantees, Kindred agreed to indemnify and hold us
harmless from and against all claims against us arising out



Index to Financial Statements

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

of the Third-Party Guarantees. Under Kindred’s plan of reorganization, Kindred assumed and agreed to fulfill its obligations under the indemnity
agreement relating to the Third-Party Guarantees. There can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy, or that it will continue to honor, its obligations incurred in connection
with the indemnity agreement relating to the Third-Party Guarantees. If Kindred is unable to or does not satisfy the obligations under any Third-Party Guarantee, then we may be liable for the payment and performance of the obligations under any such
agreement. However, we believe we may have valid legal defenses to any such claim under a Third-Party Guarantee. As of December 31, 2004, we believe that we had no material exposure under the Third-Party Guarantees.

In connection with the 1998 Spin Off, Kindred agreed in various
agreements (the “Spin Agreements”) to, among other things, assume and to indemnify us for any and all liabilities that may arise out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations either before or after the date of the 1998
Spin Off. The indemnification provided by Kindred also covers losses, including costs and expenses, which may arise from any future claims asserted against us based on these healthcare operations. In addition, at the time of the 1998 Spin Off,
Kindred agreed to assume the defense, on our behalf, of any claims that were pending at the time of the 1998 Spin Off, and which arose out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations. Kindred also agreed to defend, on our behalf, any
claims asserted after the 1998 Spin Off which arise out of the ownership and operation of the healthcare operations. Under Kindred’s plan of reorganization, Kindred assumed and agreed to perform its obligations under these indemnifications.
There can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy, or that Kindred will continue to honor, its obligations incurred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off. If Kindred does not
satisfy or otherwise honor the obligations under these arrangements, then we may be liable for the payment and performance of such obligations and may have to assume the defense of such claims.

Kindred Common Stock

On April 20, 2001, we received 1,498,500 shares of Kindred common stock,
representing not more than 9.99% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Kindred as of that date. Based on applicable laws, regulations, advice from experts, an appraisal, the trading performance of Kindred common stock at the time and other
appropriate facts and circumstances, the illiquidity and lack of registration of the Kindred common stock when received and our lack of significant influence over Kindred, we determined the value of the Kindred common stock to be $18.2 million on
the date of issuance. The Kindred common stock was issued to us as additional future rent in consideration of our agreement to charge the base rent as provided in the Kindred Master Leases.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, we disposed of a total of 159,500
shares of Kindred common stock and recognized a gain of $5.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we disposed of the remaining 920,814 shares of Kindred common stock and recognized a gain of $9.0 million. As of December 31, 2004 and
2003, we did not own any Kindred common stock.

Settlement
of United States Claims

Kindred and we were the subject
of investigations by the United States Department of Justice regarding our prior healthcare operations, including matters arising from lawsuits filed under the qui tam, or whistleblower, provision of the Federal Civil False Claims Act, which allows
private citizens to bring a suit in the name of the United States. See “Note 13—Litigation.” Kindred’s plan of reorganization contains a comprehensive settlement of all of these claims by the United States Department of Justice
(the “United States Settlement”).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Under the United States Settlement, we were required to pay $103.6 million to the United States, of
which $34.0 million was paid on April 20, 2001. The balance of $69.6 million bore interest at 6% per annum and was payable in equal quarterly installments over a five-year term commencing on June 30, 2001 and ending in 2006. We also paid
approximately $0.4 million to legal counsel for the relators in the qui tam actions. In the fourth quarter of 2000, we recorded the full amount of the obligation under the United States Settlement for $96.5 million based on an imputed interest rate
of 10.75%. On June 30, 2003, we incurred a $2.7 million non-cash expense relating to the early repayment of the United States Settlement that is reflected as interest on United States Settlement on our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The $2.7 million interest expense reflects the difference between the total amount paid by us in final repayment of the United States Settlement and the amount reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet on the date of final
repayment. There was no prepayment penalty or other cash expense on account of such early prepayment.

Note 12—Earnings Per Share

The following table shows the amounts used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share:

There were no
anti-dilutive options outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2004. Options to purchase 1.1 million shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $15.69 to $24.47 were outstanding at December 31, 2003, but were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares for the year ended December 31, 2003 and, therefore, the effect would be anti-dilutive. Options to
purchase 2.8 million shares of common stock at

exercise prices ranging from $13.13 to $26.05 were outstanding at December 31, 2002, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares for the year ended December 31, 2002 and, therefore, the effect would be anti-dilutive.

Note 13—Litigation

Legal Proceedings Presently Defended and Indemnified by Kindred Under the Spin Agreements

The following litigation and other matters arose from our operations prior
to the time of the 1998 Spin Off or relate to assets or liabilities transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off. Under the Spin Agreements, Kindred agreed to assume the defense, on our behalf, of any claims that (i) were pending at
the time of the 1998 Spin Off and which arose out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets or liabilities transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off, or (ii) were asserted after the 1998 Spin
Off and which arose out of the ownership and operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets or liabilities transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off, and to indemnify us for any fees, costs, expenses and liabilities
arising out of such operations (the “Indemnification”). Kindred is presently defending us in the matters described below, among others. Under Kindred’s plan of reorganization, Kindred assumed and agreed to abide by the Indemnification
and to defend us in these and other matters as required under the Spin Agreements. However, there can be no assurance that Kindred will continue to defend us in such matters or that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing
to enable it to satisfy such obligations or its obligations incurred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off. In addition, many of the following descriptions are based primarily on information included in Kindred’s public filings and information
provided to us by Kindred. There can be no assurance that Kindred has included in its public filings and provided us complete and accurate information in all instances.

A stockholder derivative suit entitled

Thomas G. White on behalf of Ventas, Inc. v. W. Bruce Lunsford, et al

., Case
No. 98 C103669 was filed in June 1998 in the Jefferson County, Kentucky, Circuit Court. The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain former officers and directors damaged our company by engaging in breaches of fiduciary duty, insider
trading, fraud and securities fraud and damaging our reputation. The suit seeks unspecified damages, interest, punitive damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees, other costs, and any extraordinary equitable and/or injunctive relief permitted by law
or equity to assure the plaintiff has an effective remedy. We believe the allegations in the complaint are without merit. On October 4, 2002, Kindred filed with the Court a motion to dismiss this action as to all defendants, including us, for lack
of prosecution by the plaintiffs. On October 14, 2002, the Court granted Kindred’s motion to dismiss with prejudice. On October 17, 2002, the plaintiffs filed with the Court a motion to vacate that order of dismissal in order to allow further
briefing. In response to the plaintiffs’ October 17, 2002 motion to vacate the order of dismissal, on August 13, 2003, the Court issued an order declining to dismiss the suit. In September 2003, Kindred filed a motion to dismiss this action as
to all defendants, including us, based on plaintiff’s failure to make demand for remedy upon the appropriate Board of Directors. On March 18, 2004, the presiding judge recused himself and this action was reassigned. In July 2004, the Court
ruled that it would consider the motion to dismiss this action based upon plaintiffs’ failure to make demand for remedy upon the appropriate Board of Directors. The briefing is now complete on this motion to dismiss but the Court has not yet
ruled. Kindred has indicated that it intends to continue to defend this action vigorously on our behalf. We are unable at this time to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for this action and, therefore, no provision for liability, if any,
resulting from this litigation has been made in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2004.

Kindred is a party to certain legal actions and regulatory investigations arising in the normal course of its business. We are a party to certain legal
actions and regulatory investigations that arise from the normal course of

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

our prior healthcare operations, which legal actions and regulatory investigations are being defended by Kindred under the Indemnification. Neither we nor
Kindred are able to predict the ultimate outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or other regulatory agencies will not initiate
additional investigations related to Kindred’s business or our prior healthcare business in the future, nor can there be any assurance that the resolution of any litigation or investigations, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
have a material adverse effect on Kindred’s liquidity, financial position or results of operations, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us.

Other Litigation

We are a plaintiff in an action seeking a declaratory judgment and damages entitled

Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership et al. v. Black Diamond CLO
1998-1 Ltd., et al.,

Case No. 99C107076, filed November 22, 1999 in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Kentucky. Two of the three defendants in that action, Black Diamond International Funding, Ltd. and BDC Finance, LLC (collectively
“Black Diamond”), have asserted counterclaims against us under theories of breach of contract, tortious interference with contract and abuse of process. We dispute the material allegations contained in Black Diamond’s counterclaims
and we intend to continue to pursue its claims and defend the counterclaims vigorously. We are unable at this time to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for the counterclaims in this action, and therefore, no provision for liability, if
any, resulting from this litigation has been made in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2004.

We are the plaintiff in an action entitled

Ventas, Inc. v. Sullivan & Cromwell,

Case No. 02-5232 filed by us on June 27, 2002 in the Superior
Court of the District of Columbia. The complaint asserts claims of legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty by Sullivan & Cromwell in connection with its legal representation of us in the 1998 Spin Off. The Court set a January 23, 2006
trial date for this action. Although we intend to pursue our claims in this action vigorously, there can be no assurances that we will prevail on any of the claims in this action, or, if we do prevail on one or more of the claims, the amount of the
recovery that may be awarded to us for such claims.

We are
party to various other lawsuits arising in the normal course of our business. It is the opinion of management that, except as set forth in this Note 13, the disposition of these lawsuits will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on us. If management’s assessment of our liability with respect to these actions is incorrect, such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on us.

No provision for liability, if any, resulting from the aforementioned litigation has been made in our Consolidated Financial
Statements as of December 31, 2004.

Note 14—Capital Stock

The authorized capital stock at December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002 consisted of 180,000,000 shares of common stock, par value of $0.25 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 300,000 shares have been designated Series A Participating Preferred Stock.

On June 19, 2002, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form
S-3 with the Commission relating to $750.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares and warrants. The registration statement became effective on July 8, 2002. As of December 31, 2004, $599.1 million of securities
remained available for offering under the shelf registration statement.

On March 15, 2004, we completed the sale of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering under our universal shelf registration statement. We received $51.1 million in net proceeds from the sale, which we used to
repay indebtedness under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions.



Index to Financial Statements

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002, we completed the sale of 9,000,000 shares of our
common stock with Tenet Healthcare Corporation (“Tenet”). In the offering, Tenet sold all 8,301,067 shares of our common stock that it held. Our net proceeds from the sale were $93.6 million, which we used to repay outstanding indebtedness
including the indebtedness incurred to invest in transactions with THI.

Excess Share Provision

In order to preserve
our ability to maintain REIT status, our certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires beneficial ownership of greater than 9% of the outstanding stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of such 9% limit are deemed
to be excess shares. These shares are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our Board of Directors. The trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to
the shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the shares.

We have the right to buy the excess shares for a purchase price equal to the lesser of (1) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares, or (2) the market price on the date we buy the shares.
We have the right to defer payment of the purchase price for the excess shares for up to five years. If we do not purchase the excess shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the excess shares at the direction of the Board of
Directors. The owner of the excess shares is entitled to receive the lesser of the proceeds from the sale of the excess shares or the original purchase price for such excess shares; any additional amounts are payable to the beneficiary of the trust.

The Board of Directors is empowered to grant waivers from the
excess share provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation. On June 24, 2003 we granted a waiver (the “C&S Waiver”) from the 9% ownership limitation provisions of Article XII of our Certificate of Incorporation to Cohen & Steers
Capital Management, Inc. (“C&S”). Under the C&S Waiver, C&S may beneficially own, in the aggregate, up to 14.0% in number of shares or value of our common stock.

Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

We have a Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. Under the plan’s terms, existing stockholders may purchase
shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of the cash distribution on their shares of our common stock. In addition, existing stockholders, as well as new investors, may purchase shares of common stock by making optional cash payments.
Beginning in March 2005, we are offering a 1% discount on the purchase price of our stock to shareholders who reinvest their dividends and/or make optional cash purchases of common stock through the plan. In 2004, we offered a 2% discount on
the purchase price of our stock to shareholders that participated in the plan. The availability of a market discount is at our discretion. The granting of a discount for one month or quarter, as applicable, will not insure the availability of a
discount or the same discount in future months or quarters, respectively. Each month or quarter, as applicable, we may lower or eliminate the discount without prior notice. We may also, without prior notice, change our determination as to whether
common shares will be purchased by the plan administrator directly from us or in the open market.

Note 15—Related Party Transactions

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had receivables of approximately $3.2 million and $3.8 million, respectively, due from certain current and former executive officers. The loans include interest provisions (with a
4.9% average rate) and were to finance the income taxes payable by the executive officers resulting from: (i) the 1998 Spin Off and (ii) vesting of restricted shares. The loans are payable over a period of 10 years. Interest on a

note relating to the 1998 Spin Off in the principal amount of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 (the “1998 Spin Off Note”), is paid on a quarterly
basis. The payee of the 1998 Spin Off Note resigned as an employee and director of Ventas on January 30, 2003. In the event of a change in control, as defined in our 1997 Incentive Compensation Plan, accrued interest on and the principal balance of
the 1998 Spin Off Note is forgiven. Interest on the note relating to taxes paid for the vested portion of Restricted Shares (the “Restricted Share Note”) is payable annually out of and only to the extent of dividends from the vested
restricted shares. In the event of a change in control (as defined in the relevant employment agreement) or upon termination of the officer without cause (as defined in the relevant employment agreement), the principal balance of the Restricted
Share Note is forgiven. The Restricted Share Note is secured by a pledge of all of the restricted shares to which the Restricted Share Note relates and the Restricted Share Note is otherwise non-recourse. The 1998 Spin Off Note is not secured.

On October 15, 1998, we acquired eight personal care
facilities and related facilities for approximately $7.1 million from Tangram Rehabilitation Network, Inc. (“Tangram”). Tangram is a wholly owned subsidiary of Res-Care, Inc. (“Res-Care”) of which a director of Ventas is the
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. We lease the Tangram facilities to Tangram pursuant to a master lease agreement which is guaranteed by Res-Care. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, Tangram has paid us approximately
$834,000, $816,000 and $799,000 respectively, in base rent payments.

Consolidating Information

We and certain of our
direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Wholly Owned Subsidiary Guarantors”) have fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, the obligation to pay principal and interest with respect to the Senior Notes
of the Issuers. ETOP, which is a greater than 99% owned indirect subsidiary, and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries (the “ETOP Subsidiary Guarantors” and collectively, with the Wholly Owned Subsidiary Guarantors, the
“Guarantors”), have also provided a guarantee, on a joint and several basis, of the Senior Notes. We have other subsidiaries (“Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries”) that are not included among the Guarantors, and such subsidiaries are not
obligated with respect to the Senior Notes. Contractual and legal restrictions, including those contained in the agreements governing the CMBS Transaction, and instruments governing certain Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries’ outstanding indebtedness,
may under certain circumstances restrict our ability to obtain cash from our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting our debt service obligations, including our guarantee of payment of principal and interest on the Senior Notes.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2004, approximately $113.5 million of the net assets of Ventas Realty were mortgaged to secure our revolving credit facility. Certain of our real estate assets are also subject to mortgages. The following summarizes

Note 18—ETOP Condensed Consolidating Information

ETOP, which is a greater than 99% owned indirect subsidiary of Ventas, Inc.,
and the ETOP Subsidiary Guarantors have provided full and unconditional guarantees, on a joint and several basis with us and certain of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, of the obligation to pay principal and interest with respect

of the Senior Notes are therefore not directly obligated with respect to the Senior Notes.

Contractual and legal restrictions, including those contained in the instruments governing certain of the ETOP Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries’ outstanding indebtedness, may under certain circumstances restrict
ETOP’s (and therefore our) ability to obtain cash from the ETOP Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries for the purpose of satisfying the debt service obligations of ETOP and Ventas including ETOP’s and our guarantee of payment of principal and
interest on the Senior Notes. See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements.” Certain of the ETOP Subsidiary Guarantors’ properties are subject to mortgages.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to us is timely communicated to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of our management
and Board of Directors.

Based upon their evaluation as of
December 31, 2004, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The information set forth under “Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” and “Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 9A.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other
