(“Kindred”) and certain of its affiliates to continue to meet and/or perform their obligations under their contractual arrangements with the Company and the Company’s subsidiaries, including without limitation the lease agreements and
various agreements entered into by the Company and Kindred at the time of the Company’s spin off of Kindred on May 1, 1998 (the “1998 Spin Off”), as such agreements may have been amended and restated in connection with Kindred’s
emergence from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001, (b) the ability and willingness of Kindred to continue to meet and/or perform its obligation to indemnify and defend the Company for all litigation and other claims relating to the healthcare operations
and other assets and liabilities transferred to Kindred in the 1998 Spin Off, (c) the ability of Kindred and the Company’s other operators to maintain the financial strength and liquidity necessary to satisfy their respective obligations and

conditions and/or economic conditions in the markets in which the Company may, from time to time, compete, (k) the ability of the Company to pay down, refinance, restructure, and/or extend its indebtedness as it becomes due, (l) the movement of
interest rates and the resulting impact on the value of and the accounting for the Company’s interest rate swap agreement, (m) the ability and willingness of the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT due to economic, market, legal,
tax or other considerations, (n) final determination of the Company’s taxable net income for the years ending December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004, (o) the ability and willingness of the Company’s tenants to renew their leases with the
Company upon expiration of the leases and the Company’s ability to relet its properties on the same or better terms in the event such leases expire and are not renewed by the existing tenants, and (p) the impact on the liquidity, financial
condition and results of operations of Kindred and the Company’s other operators resulting from increased operating costs and uninsured liabilities for professional liability claims, and the ability of Kindred and the Company’s other
operators to accurately estimate the magnitude of such liabilities. Many of such factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.

PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

BUSINESS

Overview

Ventas, Inc. (“Ventas” or the “Company”) is a healthcare
real estate investment trust (“REIT”) incorporated in Delaware in 1985. The Company owns a geographically diverse portfolio of healthcare and senior housing facilities. As of December 31, 2003, this portfolio consisted of 42 hospitals, 194
nursing facilities and nine other healthcare and senior housing facilities in 37 states. The Company leases these facilities to healthcare operating companies under “triple-net” leases. As of December 31, 2003, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. and
its subsidiaries (collectively, “Kindred”) leased 186 of the Company’s nursing facilities and all but one of the Company’s hospitals. The Company also has investments relating to 25 healthcare and senior housing facilities
located in Ohio and Maryland. The Company operates in one segment which consists of financing, owning and leasing healthcare-related and senior housing facilities. See the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, including “Note
2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of February 25, 2004 after giving effect to the recently completed ElderTrust Transaction (as defined below) and the acquisition of seven
Brookdale Facilities (as defined below), the Company’s portfolio consisted of 42 hospitals, 199 nursing facilities, 18 senior housing facilities and 11 other facilities in 38 states. See “—Recent Developments.” Unless otherwise
stated, the information presented herein does not give effect to the ElderTrust Transaction or the acquisition of any Brookdale Facilities.

The Company’s business strategy is comprised of two primary objectives: diversifying its portfolio of properties and increasing its earnings. The
Company intends to diversify its portfolio by operator, facility type and reimbursement source. The Company intends to invest in or acquire additional healthcare-related and/or senior housing properties, which could include hospitals, nursing
centers, assisted or independent living facilities and ancillary healthcare facilities, that are operated by qualified providers in their industries.

Portfolio of Properties

As of December 31, 2003, the Company conducted substantially all of its business through a wholly owned operating partnership, Ventas Realty, Limited
Partnership (“Ventas Realty”) and an indirect, wholly owned limited liability company, Ventas Finance I, LLC (“Ventas Finance”). As of December 31, 2003, Ventas Finance owned 39 of the Company’s skilled nursing facilities,
the Company owned two hospitals and Ventas Realty owned all of the Company’s other properties and investments.

The following information provides an overview of the Company’s portfolio of healthcare properties and investments as of December 31, 2003:



Index to Financial Statements

(a)

Includes (i) revenue of $2.3 million related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of Ventas Realty’s receipt of common stock of Kindred (the
“Kindred Common Stock”) and the amortization of the deferred revenue recorded from the receipt of $4.5 million of additional future rents under the Kindred Master Leases (defined below) and (ii) $0.2 million from subleases under the
Kindred Master Leases.

(b)

Includes interest income from the Company’s mezzanine loan made to Trans Healthcare, Inc. (“THI”) on November 4, 2002 (the “THI Mezzanine Loan”). The THI
Mezzanine Loan is secured by a pledge of ownership interests in the entities that own 17 skilled nursing facilities and one assisted living facility that also collateralize senior indebtedness not held by the Company, plus liens on four additional
healthcare/senior housing properties, and interests in three additional assets. See “Note 6—Mergers and Acquisitions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(c)

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had properties located in 37 states operated by five different operators.

Hospital Facilities

The Company’s hospitals generally are long-term acute care hospitals
that serve medically complex, chronically ill patients. The operator of these hospitals has the capability to treat patients who suffer from multiple systemic failures or conditions such as neurological disorders, head injuries, brain stem and
spinal cord trauma, cerebral vascular accidents, chemical brain injuries, central nervous system disorders, developmental anomalies and cardiopulmonary disorders. Chronic patients are often dependent on technology for continued life support, such as
mechanical ventilators, total parenteral nutrition, respiration or cardiac monitors and dialysis machines. While these patients suffer from conditions which require a high level of monitoring and specialized care, they may not necessitate the
continued services of an intensive care unit. Due to their severe medical conditions, these patients generally are not clinically appropriate for admission to a nursing facility or rehabilitation hospital.

The Company’s one 29 bed rehabilitation hospital provides high intensity
physical, respiratory, neurological, orthopedic and other treatment protocols for patients during recovery.

Nursing Facilities

The Company’s nursing facilities generally are skilled nursing facilities. In addition to the customary services provided by skilled nursing
facilities, the operators of the Company’s nursing facilities typically provide rehabilitation services, including physical, occupational and speech therapies.

Other Facilities

The Company’s eight personal care facilities serve persons with acquired or traumatic brain injury. The operator of the personal care facilities
provides services including supported living services, neurorehabilitation, neurobehavioral management and vocational programs. The Company owns one assisted living facility which provides residential care for the elderly, including assistance with
the daily activities of living.

Other Real Estate
Investments

The Company’s THI Mezzanine Loan is
secured by (1) equity pledges in entities that own and operate 17 skilled nursing facilities and one related assisted living facility located in Ohio and Maryland, (2) liens on four additional healthcare/senior living housing properties and (3)
interests in three additional properties operated by the borrower. See “Note 6—Mergers and Acquisitions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Index to Financial Statements

Geographic Diversification

The Company’s portfolio is broadly diversified by geographic location with rental and investment revenues from
facilities with only one state comprising more than ten percent of the Company’s rental and investment revenues.

(a)

Includes (i) revenue of $2.7 million related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of Ventas Realty’s receipt of Kindred common stock and the
amortization of the deferred revenue recorded from the receipt of $4.5 million of additional future rents under the Kindred Master Leases (as defined below) and (ii) $0.2 million from subleases under the Kindred Master Leases.

Certificates of Need

In addition to the diversification of lease rental revenues from the
geographic diversification of the portfolio, the majority of the Company’s facilities are located in states that have certificate of need (“CON”) requirements. Some states require state approval for development and expansion of
healthcare facilities and services, including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. A CON, which is issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities, is at times required for
expansion of existing facilities, construction of new facilities, addition of beds, acquisition of major items of equipment or introduction of new services. The CON rules and regulations may restrict an operator’s ability to expand the
Company’s properties in certain circumstances.

Dependence on Kindred

For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, Kindred
accounted for approximately 95.8% and 98.3% of the Company’s rental revenues, respectively. The Company’s reliance on Kindred is a result of a transaction in 1998 in which the Company was separated into two publicly held corporations (the
“1998 Spin Off”). A new



Index to Financial Statements

corporation, subsequently named Vencor, Inc. (which has since been renamed Kindred Healthcare, Inc.), was formed to operate the hospital, nursing facility
and ancillary services businesses, and the Company retained substantially all of the real property which it leased to Kindred.

Kindred Master Leases

As of December 31, 2003, the Company leases 41 of its hospitals and 186 of its nursing facilities to Kindred under five master lease agreements (the
“Kindred Master Leases”). Four of the Kindred Master Leases are with Ventas Realty, and the fifth (the “Kindred CMBS Master Lease”), which relates to 39 skilled nursing facilities (the “CMBS Properties”), is with Ventas
Finance.

Each Kindred Master Lease is a “triple-net
lease” pursuant to which Kindred is required to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance and repairs related to the properties.

Under each Kindred Master Lease, the aggregate annual rent is referred to as Base Rent (as defined in each Kindred Master Lease). Base Rent escalates on
May 1 of each year at an annual rate of 3.5% over the Prior Period Base Rent (as defined in the Kindred Master Leases) if certain Kindred revenue parameters are met. Assuming such Kindred revenue parameters are met, Base Rent due under the Kindred
Master Leases will be $193.6 million from May 1, 2004 to April 30, 2005. See “Note 3—Revenues from Properties” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

There are several renewal bundles of properties under each Kindred Master Lease, with each bundle containing a varying
number of properties. Properties are renewable only in bundles. All properties within a bundle have primary terms ranging from 10 to 15 years commencing May 1, 1998, plus renewal options totaling fifteen years.

The Company has a one time right to reset the rents under the Kindred Master
Leases (the “Reset Right”), exercisable during a one-year period commencing July 19, 2006 by notice given on or after January 20, 2006 on a Kindred Master Lease by Kindred Master Lease basis, to a then fair market rental rate, for a total
fee of $5.0 million payable on a pro-rata basis at the time of exercise under the applicable Kindred Master Lease. The Reset Right under the Kindred CMBS Master Lease can only be exercised in conjunction with the exercise of the Reset Right under
Master Lease No. 1. The Company cannot exercise the Reset Right under the Kindred CMBS Master Lease without the prior written consent of the CMBS Lender (defined below) if, as a result of such reset, the aggregate rent payable with respect to the
CMBS Properties would decrease. The CMBS Properties secure a loan in the original principal amount of $225.0 million (the “CMBS Loan”) from Merrill Lynch Mortgage Lending, Inc. (the “CMBS Lender”). See “Risk
Factors—Risks Arising from the Company’s Business—The Company is dependent on Kindred; Kindred’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with the Company could significantly harm the Company and
its ability to service its indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to its stockholders as required to continue to quality as a REIT.”

Recent Developments

Merger with ElderTrust

On February 5, 2004, the Company consummated a merger transaction in which the Company acquired all of the outstanding common shares of ElderTrust in an
all cash transaction valued at $184 million (the “ElderTrust Transaction”).

The ElderTrust Transaction adds nine assisted living facilities, one independent living facility, five skilled nursing facilities, two medical office buildings and one financial office building (the “ElderTrust
Properties”) to the Company’s portfolio. The ElderTrust Properties are leased by the Company to various operators under leases providing for aggregated, annual cash base rent of approximately $16.2 million, subject to escalation as
provided in the leases. The leases have remaining terms primarily ranging from 4 to 11 years. At the closing of the



Index to Financial Statements

ElderTrust Transaction, the Company also acquired all of the limited partnership units in ElderTrust Operating Limited Partnership (“ETOP”)
directly from their owners at $12.50 per unit, excluding 31,455 Class C Units in ETOP (which will remain outstanding). ETOP owns directly or indirectly all of the ElderTrust Properties. See “Note 6—Mergers and Acquisitions” to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company funded the $101
million equity portion of the purchase price with cash on ElderTrust’s balance sheet, a portion of the $85 million in proceeds from its December 2003 sale of ten facilities to Kindred and draws on the Company’s revolving credit facility
(the “Revolving Credit Facility”) under its Second Amended and Restated Security and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2002 (the “2002 Credit Agreement”). The Company’s ownership of the ElderTrust Properties is
subject to approximately $83 million of property level debt and other liabilities. At the close of the ElderTrust Transaction, ElderTrust had approximately $33.5 million in unrestricted and restricted cash on hand, effectively reducing the purchase
price.

Unless stated otherwise, the information presented
herein does not give effect to the consummation of the ElderTrust Transaction.

Transaction with Brookdale

On January 29, 2004, the Company entered into 14 definitive purchase agreements (each, a “Brookdale Purchase Agreement”) with certain affiliates of Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. to purchase (each such purchase, a
“Brookdale Acquisition”) a total of 14 independent living or assisted living facilities (each, a “Brookdale Facility”) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $115 million.

The Company expects to fund the Brookdale Acquisitions by assuming an
aggregate of approximately $41 million of non-recourse property level debt on certain of the Brookdale Facilities, with the balance to be paid from cash on hand and/or draws on the Revolving Credit Facility. The property level debt encumbers
seven of the Brookdale Facilities.

As of February 26, 2004,
the Company has completed the acquisition of seven Brookdale Facilities for an aggregate purchase price of $60.4 million, $8.8 million of which was funded by the assumption of non-recourse property level debt. The Company’s acquisition of the
remaining seven Brookdale Facilities is expected to be completed shortly, subject to customary closing conditions. However, the consummation of each such Brookdale Acquisition is not conditioned upon the consummation of any other such Brookdale
Acquisition and there can be no assurance which, if any, of such remaining Brookdale Acquisitions will be consummated or when they will be consummated.

Unless stated otherwise, the information presented herein does not give effect to the Company’s acquisition of the Brookdale Facilities.

Expiration of Rights Agreement

On July 19, 2003, the Company elected to permit its preferred stock purchase
rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated July 20, 1993, as amended, with National City Bank, as Rights Agent, to expire.

Competition

The Company competes for real property investments with healthcare providers, other healthcare-related REITs, healthcare lenders, real estate
partnerships, banks, insurance companies and other investors. Some of the Company’s competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources and lower cost of capital than the Company. The Company’s ability to continue to
compete successfully for real property investments will be determined by numerous factors, including the ability of the Company to identify suitable acquisition or investment targets, the ability of the Company to negotiate acceptable terms for any
such acquisition, the availability and cost of capital to the Company. See “Risk Factors—Risks Arising From the Company’s Business—The Company may encounter certain risks and financing constraints when implementing its business



Index to Financial Statements

strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, healthcare-related and/or senior housing properties” and “Note
7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The operators of the Company’s properties compete on a local and regional basis with other healthcare operators. The ability of the Company’s operators to compete successfully for patients at the
Company’s facilities depends upon several factors, including the quality of care at the facility, the scope of services provided, the operational reputation of the operator, physician referral patterns, physical appearance of the facilities,
other competitive systems of healthcare delivery within the community, population and demographics, and the financial condition of the operator. Private, federal and state reimbursement programs and the effect of other laws and regulations also may
have a significant effect on the Company’s operators to compete successfully for patients for the properties. See “Risk Factors—Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the Medicare
and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s tenants.”

Employees

As of
December 31, 2003, the Company had 22 full-time employees and one part-time employee. The Company considers its relationship with its employees to be good.

Insurance

The Company maintains and/or requires in its leases that its tenants maintain liability and casualty insurance on its assets and operations. Under the
Kindred Master Leases, Kindred is required to maintain, at its expense, certain insurance coverage related to the properties under the Kindred Master Leases and Kindred’s operations at the related facilities. See “—Dependence on
Kindred—Kindred Master Leases.” There can be no assurance that Kindred and the Company’s other tenants will maintain such insurance and any failure by Kindred or the Company’s other tenants to do so could have a material adverse
effect on the business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity of the Company and on the Company’s ability to service its indebtedness and its obligations under the Company’s settlement agreement with the Department of
Justice (the “United States Settlement”) and on the Company’s ability to make distributions to its stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT (a “Material Adverse Effect”). The Company believes that Kindred
and its other tenants are in substantial compliance with the insurance requirements contained in their respective leases with the Company.

The Company believes that the amount and coverage of its insurance protection through its tenants policies and its own policies is customary for similarly
situated companies in its industry. There can be no assurance that in the future such insurance will be available at a reasonable price or that the Company will be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance coverage.

Due to the increase in the number and severity of professional liability
claims against healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has been severely restricted and the premiums for such insurance coverage has increased dramatically. As a result, many healthcare operators may incur large
funded and unfunded professional liability expense, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of the healthcare providers. In addition, many healthcare providers are pursuing different
organizational and corporate structures coupled with insurance programs that provide less insurance coverage. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company’s tenants will continue to carry the insurance coverage required under the terms
of the Company’s leases, or that the Company will continue to require the same levels of insurance under its leases.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Healthcare Regulation

General

The operators of the Company’s properties derive a substantial portion
of their revenues from third party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, certain disabled persons and persons
with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a medical assistance program jointly funded by federal and state governments and administered by each state pursuant to which benefits are available to certain indigent patients. The Medicare and Medicaid
statutory framework is subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion that affect the amount and timing of reimbursement made under Medicare and Medicaid. The amounts of program payments received by the Company’s operators
and tenants can be changed by legislative or regulatory actions and by determinations by agents for the programs. See “—Healthcare Reform.” In addition, private payors, including managed care payors, increasingly are demanding
discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk. Efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon operators by private payors are expected to continue. There can
be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be available for services to be provided by the operators of the Company’s properties which currently are being reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and private payors. Significant
limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on these operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could affect adversely their ability to make
rental payments to the Company.

The operators of the
Company’s properties are subject to other extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities,
services, prices for services and billing for services. These laws authorize periodic inspections and investigations, and identification of deficiencies that, if not corrected, can result in sanctions that include loss of licensure to operate and
loss of rights to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Regulatory agencies have substantial powers to affect the actions of operators of the Company’s properties if the agencies believe that there is an imminent threat to patient
welfare, and in some states these powers can include assumption of interim control over facilities through receiverships.

Certificates of Need

Some states require state approval for development and expansion of healthcare facilities and services, including findings of need for additional or
expanded healthcare facilities or services. A CON is issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities and is at times required for expansion of existing facilities, construction of new facilities, addition of beds,
acquisition of major items of equipment or introduction of new services. The CON rules and regulations may restrict an operator’s ability to expand the Company’s properties in certain circumstances.



Index to Financial Statements

In the last several years, in response to mounting Medicaid budget deficits, many states have begun to
tighten CON controls, including the imposition of moratoriums on new nursing facilities and hospitals. Some states have also increased controls over licensing and change-of-ownership rules.

In the event that any operator of the Company’s properties fails to make
rental payments to the Company or to comply with the applicable healthcare regulations, and, in either case, such operators or their lenders fail to cure the default prior to the expiration of the applicable cure period, the ability of the Company
to evict that operator and substitute another operator or operators may be materially delayed or limited by various state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules. Such delays and
limitations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to collect rent, to obtain possession of leased properties, or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant default. In addition, the Company may also incur substantial
additional expenses in connection with any such licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings.

Fraud and Abuse

There are extensive federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry that can result in significant criminal
and civil penalties that can materially affect the operators of the Company’s properties.

Federal anti-kickback laws codified under Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the “Anti-kickback Laws”) prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost
of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by Medicare or other governmental programs.
Sanctions for violating the Anti-kickback Laws include criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and possible exclusion from government programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In the ordinary course of its business, the
operators of the Company’s properties have been and are subject regularly to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. Pursuant to the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program
Protection Act of 1987, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) periodically has issued regulations that describe some of the conduct and business relationships permissible under the Anti-kickback Laws (“Safe
Harbors”). The fact that a given business arrangement does not fall within a Safe Harbor does not render the arrangement per se illegal. Business arrangements of healthcare service providers that fail to satisfy the applicable Safe
Harbor’s criteria, however, risk increased scrutiny and possible sanctions by enforcement authorities.

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (“BBA”) also provides a number of additional anti-fraud and abuse provisions. The BBA contains civil monetary
penalties for an operator’s violation of the Anti-kickback Laws and imposes an affirmative duty on operators to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the Medicare and other government programs. The BBA also
provides a minimum ten-year period for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs for operators convicted of a prior healthcare offense.

The operators of the Company’s properties also are subject to the Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the “Stark
Law”. In the absence of an applicable exception, the Stark Law prohibits referrals by physicians of Medicare patients to providers of a broad range of designated healthcare services with which the physicians (or their immediate family members)
have ownership interests or certain other financial arrangements. The Stark Law’s self-referral prohibition includes inpatient and outpatient hospital services. Many states have adopted or are considering legislative proposals similar to the
federal referral prohibition, some of which extend beyond the Medicare and Medicaid programs to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self-referrals regardless of whether the service was
reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid.

Federal government
investigations and enforcement of healthcare laws has increased dramatically over the past several years and is expected to continue. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996



Index to Financial Statements

(“HIPAA”) greatly expanded the definition of healthcare fraud and related offenses and broadened the scope to include private healthcare plans in
addition to government payors. HIPAA also greatly increased funding for the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the Inspector General to audit, investigate and prosecute suspected healthcare fraud. Private
enforcement of healthcare fraud also has increased due in large part to amendments to the civil False Claims Act in 1986 that were designed to encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits by private
individuals, known as qui tam relators, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former patients and nurses and other employees.

The trend toward increased investigations and enforcement continued in 2003 with the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
Modernization Act of 2003 (“Medicare Modernization Act”) which targets, among other things, waste, fraud and abuse in payments for certain drugs and medical supplies. The legislation also strengthens Medicare’s efforts to recover
money paid for services and supplies that should have been paid by a party other than Medicare. Regarding long-term care specifically, the legislation authorizes a new pilot program under which certain health care workers who directly assist nursing
home residents or patients may be subject to criminal background checks. The pilot program will involve up to ten states and will be carried out over a three-year period beginning in 2004.

As state budget pressures continue, state administrative agencies may also
continue to escalate investigation and enforcement efforts to root out waste and to control fraud and abuse in the state Medicaid programs.

A violation of any of these federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments to the Company.

Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals

Substantially all of the Company’s hospitals are operated as long-term acute care hospitals (“LTACs”), which are hospitals that have a
Medicare average length of stay greater than 25 days. In order to receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, each hospital must meet the applicable conditions of participation set forth by HHS relating to the type of hospital, its equipment,
personnel and standard of medical care, as well as comply with state and local laws and regulations. Hospitals undergo periodic on-site licensure surveys, which generally are limited if the hospital is accredited by the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (“JCAHO”) or other recognized accreditation organizations. A loss of licensure or certification could adversely affect a hospital’s ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid
programs, which could in turn adversely impact the operator’s ability to make rental payments under its leases with the Company. See “—Healthcare Reform.”

Skilled Nursing Facilities

The operators of the Company’s skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”) generally are licensed on an annual or bi-annual basis and certified
annually for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs through various regulatory agencies which determine compliance with federal, state and local laws. These legal requirements relate to the quality of the nursing care provided,
qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff, the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment and continuing compliance with the laws and regulations governing the operation of nursing facilities. A loss of licensure or
certification could adversely affect a nursing facility’s ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could in turn adversely impact the operator’s ability to make rental payments under its leases with the
Company. See “—Healthcare Reform.”

Assisted
Living Facilities

Assisted living facilities
(“ALFs”) provide services to aid in activities of daily living, such as bathing, meals, security, transportation, recreation, medication supervision and limited therapeutic programs. More



Index to Financial Statements

intensive medical needs of the resident are often met within assisted living facilities by home health providers, close coordination with the resident’s
physician and skilled nursing facilities. ALFs are subject to relatively few federal regulations. Instead, they are regulated mainly by state and local laws which govern the licensing of beds, the provision of services, staffing requirements and
other operational matters. However, these state laws vary greatly from one state to another.

The recent increase in the number of ALFs around the country has attracted the attention of various federal agencies which believe there should be more federal regulation of ALFs. So far Congress has deferred the
states regulation of ALFs. As a result of the increased federal scrutiny along with the rapid increase in the number of ALFs, some states have revised and strengthened their regulation of ALFs. More states are expected to do the same in the future.

Any significant expansion in the number or type of, or a
violation of any of, these federal, state or local laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could affect adversely their ability
to make rental payments to the Company.

Healthcare Reform

Healthcare is one of the largest industries in the United
States and continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention. In an effort to reduce federal spending on healthcare, in 1997 the federal government enacted the BBA, which contained extensive changes to the Medicare and Medicaid
programs, including substantial reimbursement reductions for healthcare operations. For certain healthcare providers, including hospitals and SNFs, implementation of the BBA resulted in more drastic reimbursement reductions than had been
anticipated. In addition to its impact on Medicare, the BBA also afforded states more flexibility in administering their Medicaid plans, including the ability to shift most Medicaid enrollees into managed care plans without first obtaining a federal
waiver. Accordingly, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including payment levels and methods, are in a state of change and are less predictable than before enactment of the BBA.

Several legislative and regulatory changes have been made to the BBA to provide some relief from the drastic reductions in
Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement resulting from implementation of the BBA. In November 1999, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act (“BBRA”) was enacted, followed the next year by the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Child Health Insurance
Program Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (“BIPA”) in December 2000. As more fully discussed below, the following temporary relief provided by the BBRA and BIPA continue to remain in effect: (a) 20% increase in SNF payments for
certain high acuity patients; and (b) 6.7% increase in SNF payments for patients requiring rehabilitation services. Also discussed below, certain provisions of the BBRA and BIPA affecting payments to SNFs have expired as of October 1, 2002,
including the following: (a) temporary 4% increase for all SNF payments; and (b) 16.66% increase in SNF payments for nursing services. For LTACs, the 15% cut to capital cost reimbursement pursuant to the BBA expired October 1, 2002 which increased
payments to LTACs along with certain other relief provided by the BBRA and BIPA for LTACs, as more fully discussed below. Lastly, the BBRA and BIPA have included a moratorium on the SNF therapy caps provided by the BBA.

Since the BBA, both LTACs and SNFs have continued to receive annual payment
increases for inflation. Also, BIPA significantly increased the allowable annual inflation adjustments for SNFs. In August 2003, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) administratively corrected the market basket inflation
adjustment it used in the implementation of the prospective payment system for SNFs as mandated by the BBA. All of these changes increased Medicare reimbursement to LTACs and SNFs. See—“Medicare Reimbursement; Long Term Acute Care
Hospitals” and “Medicare Reimbursement; Skilled Nursing Facilities.”

Finally, in 2003, healthcare continued to receive significant legislative interest and public attention. On December 8, 2003, the President signed the Medicare Modernization Act, sometimes also referred to as the
“Drug Bill.” Although the Act was primarily intended to create a prescription drug benefit for Medicare



Index to Financial Statements

beneficiaries, it also includes sweeping changes to the entire Medicare program, some of which may impact reimbursement for LTACs, SNFs and pharmacy
providers. As discussed more fully below, the Medicare Modernization Act, among other things, provides full annual inflation updates for SNFs and continues the moratorium on the therapy payment caps.

All of these changes significantly impacted Medicare reimbursement to LTACs
and SNFs as further described below. See—“Medicare Reimbursement; Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals” and “Medicare Reimbursement; Skilled Nursing Facilities.” There can be no assurance that future healthcare legislation or
changes in the administration or implementation of governmental healthcare reimbursement programs will not have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition or results of operations of the Company’s operators and tenants
which could have a material adverse effect on their ability to make rental payments to the Company which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Medicare Reimbursement; Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals

The BBA reduced the amount of reimbursement to LTACs for incentive payments established pursuant to the Tax Equity and
Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, for capital expenditures and bad debts, and for services to certain patients transferred from an acute care hospital. In addition, the BBA for the first time imposed a national ceiling limitation or “national
cap” on payments that may be made in each category of hospitals exempt from a prospective payment system. LTACs previously constituted one such category.

On October 1, 2002, the provision of the BBA that reduced reimbursement for capital costs by 15% expired. Also, BIPA restored some of the cuts to TEFRA
incentives and bad debts.

The BBA also mandated the creation
of a prospective payment system for LTACs (“LTAC PPS”), which became effective on October 1, 2002 for LTAC cost report periods commencing on or after October 1, 2002.

Pursuant to the BBA and the Medicare provisions of BBRA and BIPA, LTACs are transitioning to LTAC PPS, which classifies
patients into distinct diagnostic groups based on clinical characteristics and expected resource needs.

Once fully transitioned to LTAC PPS, LTACs will no longer be reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis that reflects costs incurred, but rather on a
predetermined rate. Under LTAC PPS, payment for a Medicare beneficiary is made at a predetermined, per discharge amount for each of 510 patient categories, adjusted for differences in area wage levels. LTAC PPS includes payment for all inpatient
operating and capital costs of furnishing covered services (including routine and ancillary services), but not certain pass through costs, which include bad debts, direct medical education, and blood clotting factors. Unlike the prospective payment
system for inpatient acute care hospitals, LTAC PPS makes no adjustments for geographic reclassification, disproportionate share of low-income patients, rural location, or indirect medical education. LTAC PPS also includes payment adjustments for
short-stay cases, certain transfers and re-admissions, and high cost outlier cases.

Under the LTAC PPS, a provider may choose to receive interim payments by: (1) billing for each patient at the earlier of the time of discharge or 60 days from the time of admission; or (2) electing a periodic interim
payment methodology which estimates the total annual LTAC reimbursement by a hospital and converts that amount into bi-weekly payments.

For LTACs that have filed cost reports before October 1, 2002, a 5-year phase-in period has been implemented to gradually transition such LTACs from
cost-based reimbursement to 100 percent federal prospective payment under LTAC PPS. At the beginning of any cost reporting period during the phase-in, such LTACs may exercise a one-time, non-revocable election to transition fully to LTAC PPS rate.
According to CMS, LTAC PPS is required by law to be “budget neutral,” which means that total payments under LTAC PPS must equal the amount that would have been paid if the system had not been implemented. As such, budget



Index to Financial Statements

neutrality adjustments will continue to reduce total Medicare payments made under the system until all facilities have been fully phased-in to the system.

Updates to the LTAC payment rates are published annually for
the LTAC rate year, which first coincided with the federal fiscal year. However, in a final rule published on June 6, 2003, CMS announced its change to the rate year for the LTAC PPS from the federal fiscal year to a rate year of July 1 through June
30, which began on July 1, 2003. However, annual updates to the payment classification system and its relative weighting system will continue to coincide with the federal fiscal year as with the prospective payment system for short-term hospitals
(DRGs).

On January 26, 2004, CMS issued a proposed rule that
would increase the Medicare payment rates for long-term care hospitals by 2.9 percent starting July 1, 2004 and reduced the negative budget neutrality adjustment, both of which result in an increase in LTAC rates. The proposed rule also expanded the
existing interrupted stay policy to include a discharge and readmission to the long-term care hospital within three days, regardless of where the patient goes upon discharge. The proposed rule would modify the current episode of care requirements
and would treat a readmission as one episode. CMS is also proposing that a satellite or remote location of a long-term care hospital will be able to qualify as a separate certified long-term care hospital. Comments on this rule will be accepted
until March 23, 2004 and a final rule is expected to be published by mid-2004.

Kindred filed with CMS to convert 59 of its 61 LTACs immediately to the full federal rates under the new payment system. Kindred has stated that it continues to review the extensive regulations associated with the new
LTAC PPS. Based upon Kindred’s analysis to date, Kindred has stated that it believes that the new system should not have a material impact on its hospital operating results but may negatively impact operating cash flows in the short term.
Kindred’s estimates are based upon current patient acuity and expense levels in Kindred’s LTACs. These facts, among others, are subject to significant change. As a result of these uncertainties, Kindred has stated that it cannot predict
the ultimate impact of the new LTAC PPS on its hospital operating results and there can be no assurance that such regulations or operational changes resulting from these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on Kindred which, in turn,
could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Further, there can be no assurance that future updates to the system by CMS will not materially adversely impact the Company’s LTAC operators and in turn could have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

Medicare Reimbursement; Skilled Nursing
Facilities

The BBA established a prospective payment
system for skilled nursing facilities (“SNF PPS”). Under the SNF PPS, payment amounts are based upon classifications determined through assessments of individual Medicare patients in the skilled nursing facility, rather than on the
facility’s reasonable costs. The payments received under the SNF PPS are intended generally to cover all inpatient services for Medicare patients, including routine nursing care, most capital-related costs associated with the inpatient stay,
and ancillary services, such as respiratory therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and certain covered drugs.

Under the SNF PPS, per diem payments are made to nursing home facilities for each resident. Upon the expiration of the three-year transition period, these
per diem payments were fully transitioned into the federal SNF PPS rates. During the transition period, payments were based on a blended rate that used both a facility-specific rate and the federal rate. As a result of SNF PPS, Medicare payments to
SNFs dropped by 12.5% in 1999. Although there has been some payment relief (as described below), certain of the payment relief provisions have expired and there can be no assurance that the current reimbursement levels under the SNF PPS will
continue or be sufficient to permit the Company’s operators to satisfy their obligations, including payment of rent under their leases with the Company.

In response to widespread healthcare industry concern about the effects of the BBA, the federal government enacted the BBRA on November 29, 1999. The BBRA
did not enact any fundamental changes in the Medicare system, but rather reversed or delayed some of the reductions in Medicare payment increases mandated by the



Index to Financial Statements

BBA. It was estimated that in the four to five fiscal years after its enactment, the BBRA would return to healthcare providers approximately $16 billion of
the $115 billion the BBA was expected to cut from increases to the Medicare program. The BBRA modified SNF PPS payment rates in several important ways. First, BBRA increased the per diem reimbursement rates for certain high acuity patients by 20%
starting April 1, 2000 until such time as case-mix refinements are implemented by CMS. Second, BBRA temporarily increased the per diem rates for all patient categories by 4% from October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. Finally, outpatient
rehabilitation therapy providers received a 2-year moratorium on the annual cap on the amount of physical, occupational and speech therapy provided to a patient, which moratorium has been extended until December 31, 2005 as further discussed below.

Passed in December 2000, BIPA provided a certain degree of
relief from the projected impact of the BBA. Specifically, BIPA modified the impact of the BBA on SNF PPS payment rates, as implemented by the final BBRA rule, in several important ways. First, BIPA revised the annual market basket update factor
upward from “market basket—1%” to (a) “market basket” in federal fiscal year 2001, and (b) “market basket—0.5%” in federal fiscal years 2002 and 2003. Second, BIPA temporarily increased the nursing component
of the federal SNF PPS rate by 16.66%, from April 1, 2001 through September 30, 2002. Third, BIPA increased the per diem reimbursement rates for the rehabilitation-related patient categories by 6.7%, from April 1, 2001 until such time as case-mix
refinements are implemented pursuant to the BBRA. Finally, BIPA and the BBRA extended the moratorium on the annual therapy cap until September 1, 2003. However, a new moratorium became effective December 8, 2003 pursuant to the Medicare
Modernization Act of 2003 as further discussed below.

On April
23, 2002, HHS indicated that CMS will not implement the case-mix refinements contemplated by the BBRA until CMS has more time to study more appropriate patient classification system adjustments. As a result, the 20% increase in the per diem rates
for high acuity patients pursuant to the BBRA, and the 6.7% increase in the per diem payment rates for rehabilitation-related patients pursuant to BIPA, continue to remain in effect. CMS has estimated that nursing homes receive an estimated $1
billion per year from these temporary add-on payments. However, there can be no assurance how long these temporary payments will continue to be made or whether the refinements to the case-mix classification system that will take the place of these
temporary payments, when made, will adequately continue the favorable effect of these payments.

On September 30, 2002, the 4% increase in the payment rates for all patient categories pursuant to the BBRA and the 16.66% increase in the nursing
component of the rates pursuant to BIPA, expired. According to CMS, this decreased payments to nursing homes by $1.4 billion for the 2003 federal fiscal year which ended September 30, 2003.

In August 2003, CMS administratively corrected the market basket inflation
adjustment it used in the implementation of the prospective payment system for SNFs as mandated by the BBA. A one-time 3.26% increase to the market basket inflation adjustment was made for all SNF PPS payment rates beginning on October 1, 2003.
According to CMS, this increased payments to nursing homes by approximately $450 million for the 2004 federal fiscal year ending on September 30, 2004.

In addition, in December 2003, the Medicare Modernization Act provided that no reductions should be made to the market basket increases for the SNF PPS
rates; therefore 2004 funding was increased by the full market basket of 3% which CMS estimates will increase payments to nursing homes by approximately $400 million for the 2004 federal fiscal year commencing October 1, 2003 and ending on September
30, 2004. The Medicare Modernization Act also included a 128% increase in the SNF PPS per diem payments for residents with AIDS.

During 2003, the moratorium on application of financial limitations on therapy services went into effect. For Part B nursing facility residents, a $1500
limit was placed on the reimbursement level for physical therapy/speech language pathology services combined and a separate $1500 limit for occupational therapy. As a result of administrative delays, this limitation was only effective from September
1, 2003 through December 8, 2003, the effective date of the Medicare Modernization Act, which included a two-year moratorium on the application of therapy caps until December 31, 2005.



Index to Financial Statements

Lastly, the Medicare Modernization Act establishes new mechanisms that will base Medicare payments for
drugs and medical supplies on market prices rather than on antiquated and inflated list prices. This could significantly impact some pharmacy suppliers and retailers. However, it is not likely to impact suppliers of pharmacy services to nursing
homes which are reimbursed for drugs and supplies under the SNF PPS and not separately under market pricing.

Medicaid Reimbursement; Skilled Nursing Facilities

Approximately two-thirds of all nursing home residents are dependent on Medicaid. Medicaid reimbursement rates, however, typically are less than the
amounts charged by the operators of the Company’s properties. Moreover, rising Medicaid costs and decreasing state revenues caused by current economic conditions have prompted an increasing number of states to consider reductions in Medicaid
funding as a means of balancing their respective state budgets. Existing and future initiatives affecting Medicaid reimbursement may reduce utilization of (and reimbursement for) services offered by the operators of the Company’s properties.

On March 25, 1999, legislation was passed that prevents
nursing facility operators that decide to withdraw from the Medicaid program from evicting or transferring patients who are residents as of the effective date of withdrawal, and who rely on Medicaid to cover their long-term care expenses. In
addition, the BBA repealed the “Boren Amendment” federal payment standard for Medicaid payments to hospitals and nursing facilities effective October 1, 1997, giving states greater latitude in setting payment rates for these providers.

CMS also has promulgated a final regulation (“Final
Regulation”) to restrict the “upper-payment limit loophole” in Medicaid. The Final Regulation revises a provision of a prior regulation published on January 12, 2001 that allowed states to make overall payments to public non-state
government owned or operated hospitals of up to 150% of the estimated amount that would be paid under Medicare for the same services. Under the Final Regulation, these payments are limited to 100% of estimated Medicare payments, which is the limit
for all other hospitals. The resulting effect of the Final Regulation is that states may implement rate or service cuts to providers (including SNFs) to compensate for reduced federal funding. According to CMS, the Final Regulation became effective
on May 15, 2002. The Company cannot predict the impact of the Final Regulation on the Company’s tenants and operators.

For the last several years, many states have announced actual or potential budget shortfalls. As a result of these budget shortfalls, many states have
announced that they are implementing or considering implementing “freezes” or cuts in Medicaid rates paid to SNF providers. It is premature to assess whether significant Medicaid rate freezes or cuts will be adopted, and if so, by how many
states or the impact of such action on the Company’s operators. However, severe and widespread Medicaid rate cuts or freezes could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results
of operations, which could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments to the Company.

On May 28, 2003, the federal Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (“Tax Relief Act”) was enacted, which included a $10 billion increase
in Medicaid federal funding through federal fiscal year 2004. In addition, the Tax Relief Act provides an additional $10 billion in state fiscal relief for federal fiscal years 2003 and 2004 to assist states with funding shortfalls. These temporary
federal funding provisions were intended to mitigate state Medicaid funding reductions through mid-calendar year 2004.

Nursing Home Quality Initiative

In 2002 HHS launched the Nursing Home Quality Initiative program. This program, which is designed to provide consumers with comparative information about
nursing home quality measures, rates nursing homes on various quality of care indicators. Since 2002, investigative and enforcement activities regarding nursing home quality compliance has intensified both on the federal and state administrative
levels.



Index to Financial Statements

If the operators of the Company’s properties are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are
comparable or superior to those of their competitors, patients may choose alternate facilities, which could cause operating revenues to decline. In the event the financial condition or operating revenues of these operators adversely affected, the
operators’ ability to make rental payments to the Company could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Environmental Regulation

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property from which
there is or has been a release or threatened release of a hazardous or toxic substance or petroleum into the environment or an entity that arranges for the disposal or treatment of a hazardous or toxic substance or petroleum at a disposal site may
be held jointly and severally liable for the cost to investigate and clean up such property or other affected property. Such laws and regulations often impose liability whether or not the owner, operator or otherwise responsible party knew of, or
caused the presence of the hazardous or toxic substance or petroleum. The costs of any required investigation or cleanup of these substances could be substantial, and the liability of a responsible party as to any property is generally not limited
under such laws and regulations and could exceed the property’s value and the aggregate assets of the liable party. The presence of these substances or failure to address such substances properly also may adversely affect the owner’s
ability to sell or rent the property, or to borrow using the property as collateral. In connection with the ownership and leasing of the Company’s properties, the Company could be liable for these costs as well as certain other costs, including
governmental fines and injuries to person or properties or natural resources. In addition, owners and operators of real property are liable for the costs of complying with environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances and regulations and can be
subjected to penalties for failure to comply. Such ongoing compliance costs and penalties for non-compliance can be substantial. Changes to existing or the adoption of new environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances, and regulations could
substantially increase an owner’s or operator’s environmental, health, and safety compliance costs and/or associated liabilities. Environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances, and regulations potentially affecting the Company address
a wide variety of topics, including, but not limited to, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, fuel oil management, wastewater discharges, air emissions, radioactive materials, medical wastes, and hazardous wastes. The Company is generally
indemnified by the current operators of its properties for contamination caused by such operators. Under the Kindred Master Leases, Kindred has agreed to indemnify the Company against any environmental claims (including penalties and clean-up costs)
resulting from any condition arising in, on or under, or relating to, the leased properties at any time on or after the commencement date of the lease term for the applicable leased property. Kindred also has agreed to indemnify the Company against
any environmental claim (including penalties and clean up costs) resulting from any condition permitted to deteriorate, on or after the commencement date of the lease term for the applicable leased property (including as a result of migration from
adjacent properties not owned or operated by the Company or any of its affiliates other than Kindred and its direct affiliates). There can be no assurance that Kindred or another operator will have the financial capability or the willingness to
satisfy any such environmental claims. See “Risk Factors—Risks Arising from the Company’s Business—The Company is dependent on Kindred; Kindred’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements
with the Company could significantly harm the Company and its ability to service its indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to its stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT.” If Kindred or another operator
is unable or unwilling to satisfy such claims, the Company may be required to satisfy the claims. The Company has agreed to indemnify Kindred and certain of its other operators against any environmental claims (including penalties and clean-up
costs) resulting from any condition arising on or under, or relating to, the leased properties at any time before the commencement date of the lease term for the applicable leased property.

See “Risk Factors—If any of the Company’s properties are found
to be contaminated, or if the Company becomes involved in any environmental disputes, the Company could incur substantial liabilities and costs.”

The Company did not make any material capital expenditures in connection with such environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances, and regulations in
2003 and does not expect that it will have to make any such material capital expenditures during 2004.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

The discussion of “Federal Income Tax Considerations” set forth herein is not exhaustive of all possible tax
considerations and is not tax advice. Moreover, this summary does not deal with all tax aspects that might be relevant to a particular stockholder in light of such stockholder’s circumstances, nor does it deal with particular types of
stockholders that are subject to special treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), such as insurance companies, financial institutions and broker-dealers. The Code provisions governing the federal income
tax treatment of REITs are highly technical and complex, and this summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable Code provisions, rules and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof.
The following discussion is based on current law, which could be changed at any time, possibly retroactively.

Federal Income Taxation of the Company

The Company elected REIT status beginning with the year ended December 31, 1999. Beginning with the 1999 tax year, the Company believes that it has satisfied the requirements to qualify as a REIT. The Company intends
to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. If the Company continues to qualify for taxation as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on net income that it currently distributes to
stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” (i.e., taxation at both the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results from investment in a corporation.

Notwithstanding its qualification as a REIT, the Company will be subject to
federal income tax on any undistributed taxable income, including undistributed net capital gains at regular corporate rates. In addition, the Company will be subject to a 4% excise tax if it does not satisfy specific REIT distribution requirements.
See “—Requirements for Qualification—Annual Distribution Requirements.” The Company may be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on its undistributed items of tax preference. If the Company has (i) net income from
the sale or other disposition of “foreclosure property” (see below) that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or (ii) other non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, it will be subject to tax at
the highest corporate rate on such income. See “—Requirements for Qualification—Asset Tests.” In addition, if the Company has net income from “prohibited transactions” (which are, in general, certain sales or other
dispositions of property (other than foreclosure property) held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business), such income will be subject to a 100% tax.

The Company may also be subject to “Built-in Gains Tax” on any appreciated asset that it owns or acquires that was
previously owned by a C corporation (i.e., a corporation generally subject to full corporate level tax). The Company owns appreciated assets that it held on January 1, 1999, the effective date of its REIT election. These assets are subject to the
Built-in Gains Tax rules because the Company was a taxable C corporation prior to January 1, 1999. If the Company disposes of any of these assets and the Company recognizes gain on the disposition of such asset during the 10-year period following
January 1, 1999, then, the Company generally will be subject to regular corporate income tax on the gain equal to the lower of (a) the recognized gain at the time of the disposition or (b) the built-in gain in that asset as of January 1, 1999. The
total amount of gain on which the Company can be taxed under the Built-in Gains Tax rules is limited to its net built-in gain at the time it became a REIT, i.e., the excess of the aggregate fair market value of its assets at the time it became a
REIT over the adjusted tax bases of those assets at that time. In connection with the sale of any assets, all or a portion of such gain could be treated as ordinary income instead of capital gain and be subject to taxation and/or the minimum REIT
distribution requirements.

See “—Requirements for
Qualification” below for other circumstances in which the Company may be required to pay federal taxes.



Index to Financial Statements

Requirements for Qualification

To continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company must continue to meet the requirements discussed below, relating to the
Company’s organization, sources of income, nature of assets and distributions of income to stockholders.

Organizational Requirements

The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association (i) that is managed by one or more directors or trustees; (ii) the beneficial ownership of
which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest; (iii) that would be taxable as a domestic corporation, but for Sections 856 through 859 of the Code; (iv) that is neither a financial institution nor
an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the Code; (v) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year
(the “100 Shareholder Rule”); (vi) not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) during the last half of
each taxable year (the “5/50 Rule”); (vii) that makes an election to be a REIT (or has made such election for a previous taxable year) and satisfies all relevant filing and other administrative requirements established by the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) that must be met in order to elect and to maintain REIT status; (viii) that uses a calendar year for federal income tax purposes; and (ix) that meets certain other tests, described below, regarding the nature of its
income and assets.

The Company believes that it has satisfied
the organizational requirements and believes it will continue to do so in the future. In order to prevent a concentration of ownership of the Company’s stock that would cause the Company to fail the 5/50 Rule or the 100 Shareholder Rule, the
Company has placed certain restrictions on the transfer of its shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership. However, such restrictions may not prevent the Company from failing to meet these requirements, and thereby
failing to qualify as a REIT.

In addition, to qualify as a
REIT, a corporation may not have (as of the end of the taxable year) any earnings and profits that were accumulated in periods before it elected REIT status. The Company believes that at December 31, 1999 it did not have any accumulated earnings and
profits that are attributable to periods during which the Company was not a REIT, although the IRS would be entitled to challenge that determination.

Gross Income Tests

To continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company must satisfy two annual gross income requirements. First, at least 75% of the Company’s gross income
(excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must consist of defined types of income derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property (including pledges of equity
interest in certain entities holding real property and also including “rents from real property” (defined below)) and, in certain circumstances, interest on certain types of temporary investment income. Second, at least 95% of the
Company’s gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must be derived from such real property or temporary investments, dividends, interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or
securities, or from any combination of the foregoing. To qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests, rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income
of the tenant. Also, the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15% of the total rent. Further, the Company generally must not operate or manage the property or furnish or render services to the tenants of such property, other than
through an “independent contractor” who is adequately compensated and from whom the Company derives no income (a de minimis exception is allowed for noncustomary services provided by the Company if the annual value of does not exceed 1% of
the gross income derived from the property).

Amounts received from a tenant will not qualify as “rents from real property” if the Company,
or an owner of 10% or more of the Company, directly or constructively is deemed to own 10% or more of the ownership interests in the tenant (a “Related Party Tenant”).

The Company does not believe that it has, and does not anticipate that it will in the future, (i) charged/charge rent that
is based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person (except by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales consistent with the rule described above), (ii) derived/derive rent attributable to
personal property leased in connection with real property that exceeds 15% of the total rents, (iii) derived/derive rent attributable to a Related Party Tenant, or (iv) provided/provide any noncustomary services to tenants other than through
qualifying independent contractors, except as permitted by the 1% de minimis exception or to the extent that the amount of resulting nonqualifying income would not cause the Company to fail to satisfy the 95% and 75% gross income tests. The Company
believes it has been and will continue to be in compliance with the gross income tests. However, there can be no assurance that the Company is or will continue to be in compliance with the gross income tests.

If the Company fails to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income
tests for any taxable year, it may nevertheless continue to qualify as a REIT for such year if it is entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. These relief provisions generally will be available if the Company’s failure to meet
such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the Company attaches a schedule of the sources of its income to its return and any incorrect information on the schedules was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax. It is not
possible, however, to state whether in all circumstances the Company would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. Even if these relief provisions were to apply, a 100% tax would be imposed with respect to the excess net income.

Asset Tests

At the close of each quarter of its taxable year, the Company must satisfy
two tests relating to the nature of its assets. First, at least 75% of the value of the Company’s total assets must be represented by cash or cash items (including certain receivables), government securities, “real estate assets” or,
in cases where the Company raises new capital through stock or long-term (maturity of at least five years) debt offerings, temporary investments in stock or debt instruments during the one-year period following the Company’s receipt of such
capital (the “75% asset test”). The term “real estate asset” includes interests in real property, interests in mortgages on real property to the extent the mortgage balance does not exceed the value of the associated real
property, and shares of other REITs. For purposes of the 75% asset test, the term “interest in real property” includes an interest in land and improvements thereon, such as buildings or other inherently permanent structures (including
items that are structural components of such buildings or structures), a leasehold in real property and an option to acquire real property (or a leasehold in real property). Second, of the investments not included in the 75% asset class, the value
of any one issuer’s debt and equity securities owned by the Company (other than the Company’s interest in any entity classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, the stock of a taxable REIT subsidiary (as defined below) or
the stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary) may not exceed 5% of the value of the Company’s total assets (the “5% asset test”), and the Company may not own more than 10% of any one issuer’s outstanding voting securities or 10% of
the value of any one issuer’s outstanding securities, subject to limited “safe harbor” exceptions for certain straight debt obligations (except for the Company’s ownership interest in an entity that is disregarded for federal
income tax purposes, that is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that is the stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary) (the “10% securities test”). In addition, no more than 20% of the value of the Company’s
assets can be represented by securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries.

If the Company should fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter except for its first calendar quarter, such a failure would not cause it to fail to qualify as a REIT or to lose its REIT status if (i) it satisfied all
of the asset tests at the close of the preceding calendar quarter and (ii) the discrepancy between the value of the Company’s assets and the asset test requirements arose from changes in the market values of its assets and was not wholly or
partly caused by an acquisition of nonqualifying assets. If the condition described in



Index to Financial Statements

clause (ii) of the preceding sentence were not satisfied, the Company still could avoid disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy within 30 days after
the close of the calendar quarter in which it arose. The Company intends to maintain adequate records of the value of its assets to ensure compliance with the asset tests and to take such other actions as may be required to comply with those tests.

The Company believes it has been and will continue to be in
compliance with the 10% securities test and the 5% asset test. There can be no assurance the Company is or will continue to be in compliance with either of these tests. If the Company failed to satisfy either of these tests, the Company would lose
its REIT status. If the Company lost its status as a REIT, it would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Related Party Tenant

The Company leases substantially all of its properties to Kindred and Kindred is the primary source of the Company’s rental revenues. Under
Kindred’s plan of reorganization (the “Kindred Reorganization Plan”), Ventas Realty received 1,498,500 shares of Kindred Common Stock on April 20, 2001, the date the Kindred Reorganization Plan became effective (the “Kindred
Effective Date”). Under the Code, if the Company owns 10% or more of any class of Kindred’s issued and outstanding voting securities or 10% or more of the value of any class of Kindred’s issued and outstanding securities (previously
defined as the “10% securities test”), Kindred would be a Related Party Tenant. As a Related Party Tenant, the Company’s rental revenue from Kindred would not qualify as “rents from real property” and the Company would lose
its REIT status because it likely would not be able to satisfy either the 75% or the 95% gross income test. The Company’s loss of REIT status would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Since the Kindred Effective Date, Ventas Realty has disposed of all shares of
its Kindred Common Stock. Based upon applicable tax authorities and decisions and advice from the IRS, the Company believes that for purposes of the 10% securities test, its ownership percentage in Kindred has been less than 9.99%.

Foreclosure Property

The foreclosure property rules permit the Company (by the Company’s
election) to foreclose or repossess properties without being disqualified as a result of receiving income that does not qualify under the gross income tests; however, a corporate tax is imposed upon net income from “foreclosure property”
that is not otherwise “good REIT” income. Detailed rules specify the calculation of the tax. The after tax amount increases the amount the REIT must distribute each year.

“Foreclosure property” includes any real property and any personal property incident to such real property
acquired by bid at foreclosure or by agreement or process of law after there was a default or a default was imminent on the leased property. However, for qualified healthcare properties, the Company is permitted to terminate leases other than by
reason of default or imminent default. During a 90-day grace period, the Company may operate the foreclosed property without an “independent contractor” or qualifying lessee. The 90-day grace period will begin on the date the Company
acquires possession of the property.

To maintain foreclosure
property treatment after the 90 day grace period, the Company must cause the property to be managed by an “independent contractor” (from whom the Company derives or receives no income) or lease the property pursuant to a lease qualifying
as a true lease for income tax purposes to an unrelated third party. Ownership of the tenant must not be attributed to the Company in violation of the related tenant rule of Section 856(d)(2)(B) (relating to 10% or more owned tenants). If the
property is leased to a third party under a true lease, the foreclosure property rules are not then relevant.

Foreclosure property treatment will end on the first day on which the REIT enters into a lease of the property that will give rise to income that is not
good rental income under Section 856(c)(3). In addition, foreclosure property treatment will end if any construction takes place on the property (other than completion of



Index to Financial Statements

a building, or other improvement more than 10 percent complete before default became imminent). Foreclosure property treatment is available for an initial
period of three years and may be extended up to six years. Foreclosure property treatment for qualified healthcare property is available for an initial period of two years and may be extended up to six years.

Taxable REIT Subsidiaries

The Company is permitted to own up to 100% of a “taxable REIT
subsidiary” or a “TRS.” Tax legislation implemented TRS Rules to allow REITs to have greater flexibility in engaging in activities, which previously had been prohibited by REIT rules. TRSs are corporations subject to tax as a regular
“C” corporation. Generally, a taxable REIT subsidiary can own assets that cannot be owned by a REIT and can perform otherwise impermissible tenant services (excluding the direct or indirect operation or management of a lodging or
healthcare facility) which would otherwise disqualify the REIT’s rental income under the REIT income tests. In enacting the taxable REIT subsidiary rules, Congress intended that the arrangements between a REIT and its taxable REIT subsidiaries
be structured to ensure that a taxable REIT subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation. As a result, there are certain limits on the ability of a taxable REIT subsidiary to deduct interest payments made to the
Company. In addition, the Company will be obligated to pay a 100% penalty tax on some payments that it receives or on certain expenses deducted by the taxable REIT subsidiary if the economic arrangements between the REIT, the REIT’s tenants and
the taxable REIT subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties.

On March 26, 2002, the Company formed a taxable REIT subsidiary, Ventas Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation. On November 8, 2002, the Company
formed another taxable REIT subsidiary, Ventas TRS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Both companies are owned 100% by Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership. As of December 31, 2003, neither Ventas Capital Corporation nor Ventas TRS, LLC owned
any assets of the Company.

Annual Distribution Requirements

In order to be taxed as a REIT, the Company is required
to distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to its stockholders in an amount at least equal to (i) the sum of (A) 90% of the Company’s “REIT taxable income” (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and
its net capital gain) and (B) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (ii) the sum of certain items of noncash income. Such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following
taxable year if declared before the Company timely files its tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. To the extent that the Company does not distribute all of its net capital gain
or distributes at least 90%, but less than 100%, of its “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, it will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular capital gains and ordinary corporate tax rates except to the extent of net
operating loss or capital loss carryforwards. If any taxes are paid in connection with the Built-in Gains Tax rules, these taxes will be deductible in computing REIT taxable income. Furthermore, if the Company should fail to distribute during each
calendar year at least the sum of (i) 85% of its REIT ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of its REIT capital gain net income for such year (other than long-term capital gain the Company elects to retain and treat as having been distributed to
stockholders), and (iii) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, the Company will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts actually distributed.

The Company believes it has satisfied the annual distribution requirements
for the year of its REIT election and each year thereafter. However, there can be no assurance that the Company has satisfied the distribution requirements for the year of its REIT election and subsequent years. Although the Company intends to
continue meeting the annual distribution requirements to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2003 and subsequent years, it is possible that economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may limit
the Company’s ability to meet such requirements. As a result, if it were not able to meet the annual distribution requirement, it would fail to qualify as a REIT.



Index to Financial Statements

Failure to Continue to Qualify

If the Company’s election to be taxed as a REIT is revoked or terminated (e.g., due to a failure to meet the REIT
qualification tests), the Company will be subject to tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate rates except to the extent of net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards. Distributions to
stockholders will not be deductible by the Company, nor will they be required to be made. To the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits, all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income, and, subject to certain
limitations in the Code, corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction. In addition, the Company would be prohibited from re-electing REIT status for the four taxable years following the year during which the Company
ceased to qualify as a REIT, unless certain relief provisions of the Code applied. It is impossible to predict whether the Company would be entitled to such statutory relief.

Taxation of U.S. Stockholders

As used herein, the term “U.S. Stockholder” means a holder of the Company’s common stock that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is (i) a
citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision thereof, (iii) an estate whose income from sources without the
United States is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its connection with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States or (iv) any trust with respect to which (A) a U.S. court is able to
exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and (B) one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.

As long as the Company qualifies as a REIT, distributions made to the Company’s taxable U.S. Stockholders out of
current or accumulated earnings and profits (and not designated as capital gain dividends) will be taken into account by such U.S. Stockholders as ordinary income and will not be eligible for the capital gains tax rate (i.e., qualified dividends
rate) generally available to individuals or for the dividends received deduction generally available to corporations. Distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as a capital gain (to the extent such distributions do
not exceed the Company’s actual net capital gain for the taxable year) without regard to the period for which the stockholder has held its shares. The tax rates applicable to such capital gains are discussed below. Distributions in excess of
current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a stockholder to the extent that they do not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder’s shares, but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of such shares. To the extent that
distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a stockholder’s shares, such distributions will be included in income as capital gains assuming the shares are capital assets in the hands of
the stockholder. The tax rate applicable to such capital gain will depend on the stockholder’s holding period for the shares. In addition, any distribution declared by the Company in October, November or December of any year and payable to a
stockholder of record on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by the Company and received by the stockholder on December 31 of such year, provided that the distribution is actually paid by the Company during January of
the following calendar year.

The Company may elect to treat
all or a part of its undistributed net capital gain as if it had been distributed to its stockholders (including for purposes of the 4% excise tax discussed above under “Requirements for Qualification—Annual Distribution
Requirements”). If the Company should make such an election, the Company’s stockholders would be required to include in their income as long-term capital gain their proportionate share of the Company’s undistributed net capital gain,
as designated by the Company. Each such stockholder would be deemed to have paid its proportionate share of the income tax imposed on the Company with respect to such undistributed net capital gain, and this amount would be credited or refunded to
the stockholder. In addition, the tax basis of the stockholder’s shares would be increased by its proportionate share of undistributed net capital gains included in its income, less its proportionate share of the income tax imposed on the
Company with respect to such gains.



Index to Financial Statements

Stockholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any net operating losses or capital
losses of the Company. Instead, such losses would be carried over by the Company for potential offset against its future income (subject to certain limitations). Taxable distributions from the Company and gain from the disposition of the
Company’s common stock will not be treated as passive activity income and, therefore, stockholders generally will not be able to apply any “passive activity losses” (such as losses from certain types of limited partnerships in which
the stockholder is a limited partner) against such income. In addition, taxable distributions from the Company generally will be treated as investment income for purposes of the investment interest limitations. Capital gains from the disposition of
the shares (or distributions treated as such) will be treated as investment income only if the stockholder so elects, in which case such capital gains will be taxed at ordinary income rates. The Company will notify stockholders after the close of
the Company’s taxable year as to the portions of the distributions attributable to that year that constitute ordinary income, return of capital and capital gain.

In general, any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of the Company’s common stock by a stockholder who is
not a dealer in securities will be treated as capital gain or loss. Lower marginal tax rates for individuals may apply in the case of capital gains, depending on the holding period of the shares that are sold. However, any loss upon a sale or
exchange of shares by a stockholder who has held such shares for six months or less (after applying certain holding period rules) will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of distributions from the Company required to be treated by
such stockholder as long-term capital gain. All or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares may be disallowed if other shares are purchased within 30 days before or after the disposition.

For non-corporate taxpayers, the tax rate differential between capital gain
and ordinary income may be significant. The highest marginal individual income tax rate applicable to ordinary income is currently 35.0%. Any capital gain generally will be taxed to a non-corporate taxpayer at a maximum rate of 15% with respect to
capital assets held for more than one year. The tax rates applicable to ordinary income apply to gain attributable to the sale or exchange of capital assets held for one year or less. In the case of capital gain attributable to the sale or exchange
of certain real property held for more than one year, an amount of such gain equal to the amount of all prior depreciation deductions not otherwise required to be taxed as ordinary depreciation recapture income will be taxed at a maximum rate of
25%. With respect to distributions designated by a REIT as capital gain dividends (including deemed distributions of retained capital gains), the REIT also may designate (subject to certain limits) whether the dividend is taxable to non-corporate
stockholders as a 15% rate gain distribution or an unrecaptured depreciation distribution taxed at a 25% rate.

The characterization of income as capital or ordinary may affect the deductibility of capital losses. Capital losses not offset by capital gains generally
may be deducted against a non-corporate taxpayer’s ordinary income only up to a maximum annual amount of $3,000. Non-corporate taxpayers may carry forward their unused capital losses. All net capital gain of a corporate taxpayer is subject to
tax at ordinary corporate rates. A corporate taxpayer can deduct capital losses only to the extent of capital gains, with unused losses being carried back three years and forward five years.

Treatment of Tax-Exempt Stockholders

Tax-exempt organizations, including qualified employee pension and profit
sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts (collectively, “Exempt Organizations”), generally are exempt from federal income taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income (UBTI). While
many investments in real estate generate UBTI, the IRS has issued a published ruling that dividend distributions by a REIT to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares of the REIT are not otherwise used in an
unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust. Based on that ruling, and subject to the exceptions discussed below, amounts distributed by the Company to Exempt Organizations generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an
Exempt Organization finances its acquisition of the Company’s common stock with debt, a portion of its income from the Company will constitute UBTI pursuant to



Index to Financial Statements

the “debt-financed property” rules. Furthermore, social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts
and qualified group legal services plans that are exempt from taxation under paragraphs (7), (9), (17) and (20), respectively, of Section 501(c) of the Code are subject to different UBTI rules, which generally will require them to characterize
distributions from the Company as UBTI. In addition, in certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns more than 10% of the Company’s stock is required to treat a percentage of the dividends from the Company as UBTI (the “UBTI
Percentage”). The UBTI Percentage is the gross income, less related direct expenses, derived by the Company from an unrelated trade or business (determined as if the Company were a pension trust) divided by the gross income, less related direct
expenses, of the Company for the year in which the dividends are paid. The UBTI rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10% of the Company’s stock only if (i) the UBTI Percentage is at least 5%, (ii) the Company qualifies as a REIT by
reason of the modification of the 5/50 Rule that allows the beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares of the Company in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and (iii) either (A) one pension trust owns
more than 25% of the value of the Company’s stock or (B) a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10% of the value of the Company’s stock collectively own more than 50% of the value of the Company’s stock.

Special Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Stockholders

The rules governing U.S. federal income taxation of nonresident alien
individuals, foreign corporations, foreign partnerships and other foreign stockholders (collectively, “Non-U.S. Stockholders”) are complex, and no attempt will be made herein to provide more than a summary of such rules. Non-U.S.
stockholders should consult with their own tax advisors to determine the impact of federal, state and local income tax laws with regard to their ownership of the Company’s common stock, including any reporting requirements.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Stockholder”
does not include any foreign stockholder whose investment in the Company’s stock is “effectively connected” with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Such a foreign stockholder, in general, will be subject to
United States federal income tax with respect to its investment in the Company’s stock in the same manner as a U.S. Stockholder is taxed (subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of
nonresident alien individuals). In addition, a foreign corporation receiving income that is treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business also may be subject to an additional 30% “branch profits tax,” unless an applicable
tax treaty provides a lower rate or an exemption. Certain certification requirements must be satisfied in order for effectively connected income to be exempt from withholding.

Distributions to Non-U.S. Stockholders that are not attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by the Company of U.S. real
property interests and are not designated by the Company as capital gain dividends (or deemed distributions of retained capital gains) will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of current or accumulated
earnings and profits of the Company. Such distributions ordinarily will be subject to a withholding tax equal to 30% of the gross amount of the distribution unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates that tax. Distributions in excess of
current and accumulated earnings and profits of the Company will not be taxable to a stockholder to the extent that such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder’s shares, but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of
such shares. To the extent that distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a Non-U.S. Stockholder’s shares, such distributions will give rise to tax liability if the Non-U.S. Stockholder
would otherwise be subject to tax on any gain from the sale or disposition of its shares, as described below.

For any year in which the Company qualifies as a REIT, distributions that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by the Company of U.S. real
property interests will be taxed to a Non-U.S. Stockholder under the provisions of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”). Under FIRPTA, distributions attributable to gain from sales of U.S. real property
interests are taxed to a Non-U.S. Stockholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. business. Non-U.S. Stockholders thus would be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to U.S. Stockholders (subject to applicable
alternative minimum tax and a



Index to Financial Statements

special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals). Distributions subject to FIRPTA also may be subject to 30% branch profits tax
in the hands of a foreign corporate stockholder not entitled to treaty relief or exemption.

The Company expects to withhold U.S. tax at the rate of 30% on the gross amount of any dividends, other than dividends treated as attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests and
capital gain dividends, paid to a Non-U.S. Stockholder, unless (a) a lower treaty rate applies and the required form evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with us or the appropriate withholding agent or (b) the Non-U.S. Stockholder
files an IRS Form W-8 ECI or a successor form with us or the appropriate withholding agent claiming that the distributions are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Stockholder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business.

Under FIRPTA, the Company is required to withhold 35% of any distribution
that is designated as a capital gain dividend or which could be designated as a capital gain dividend. Thus, if the Company designates previously made distributions as capital gain dividends, subsequent distributions (up to the amount of such prior
distributions) will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of FIRPTA withholding.

For so long as the Company’s common stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, the sale of such stock by any Non-U.S. Stockholder who is not a Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder
(as defined below) generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax (unless the Non-U.S. Stockholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year of the sale
and certain other conditions apply, in which case such gain will be subject to a 30% tax on a gross basis). A “Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder” is a Non-U.S. Stockholder who, at some time during the five-year period preceding such sale
or disposition, beneficially owned (including under certain attribution rules) more than 5% of the total fair market value of the Company’s common stock (as outstanding from time to time) or owned shares of another class of stock of the Company
that represented value greater than 5% of the Company’s common stock (measured at the time such shares were acquired).

In general, the sale or other taxable disposition of the Company’s common stock by a Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder (as defined below) also will
not be subject to United States federal income tax if the Company is a “domestically controlled REIT.” A REIT is a “domestically controlled REIT” if, at all times during the five-year period preceding the relevant testing date,
less than 50% in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by Non-U.S. Stockholders (taking into account those persons required to include the Company’s dividends in income for United States federal income tax purposes). Although the
Company believes that it currently qualifies as a “domestically controlled REIT,” because the Company’s common stock is publicly traded, no assurance can be given that the Company will qualify as a domestically controlled REIT at any
time in the future. If the Company does not constitute a domestically controlled REIT, a Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder will be taxable in the same manner as a U.S. Stockholder with respect to gain on the sale of the Company’s common stock
(subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals).

Information Reporting Requirements and Backup Withholding Tax

The Company will report to its U.S. Stockholders and to the IRS the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and distributions required to
be treated as so paid during a calendar year, and the amount of tax withheld, if any. Under the backup withholding rules, a stockholder may be subject to backup withholding at the applicable rate (currently 28%) with respect to distributions paid
unless such holder (i) is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories and, when required, demonstrates this fact or (ii) provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and
otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. A stockholder who does not provide the Company with its correct taxpayer identification number also may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS. In addition, the
Company may be required to withhold a portion of capital gain distributions to any stockholders who fail to certify their non-foreign status to the Company.



Index to Financial Statements

U.S. Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualifications for an exemption
from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a U.S. Stockholder will be allowed as a credit against
the U.S. Stockholder’s United States federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Stockholder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.

Backup withholding tax and information reporting generally will not apply to distributions paid to Non-U.S. Stockholders
outside the United States that are treated as (i) dividends subject to the 30% (or lower treaty rate) withholding tax discussed above, (ii) capital gain dividends or (iii) distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by the Company
of U.S. real property interests. As a general matter, backup withholding and information reporting will not apply to a payment of the proceeds of a sale of the Company’s common stock by or through a foreign office of a foreign broker.
Information reporting (but not backup withholding) will apply, however, to a payment of the proceeds of a sale of the Company’s common stock by a foreign office of a broker that (i) is a United States person, (ii) derives 50% or more of its
gross income for certain periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or (iii) is a “controlled foreign corporation” for United States tax purposes, unless the broker has documentary evidence in its records that
the holder is a Non-U.S. Stockholder and certain other conditions are satisfied, or the stockholder otherwise establishes an exemption. Payment to or through a United States office of a broker of the proceeds of a sale of the Company’s common
stock is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the stockholder certifies under penalties of perjury that the stockholder is a Non-U.S. Stockholder or otherwise establishes an exemption. A Non-U.S. Stockholder may obtain
a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS.

Other Tax Considerations

The Company and its stockholders may be subject to state and local tax in states and localities in which they do business or own property. The tax
treatment of the Company and the stockholders in such jurisdictions may differ from the federal income tax treatment described above. Consequently, stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws
on their ownership of shares of the Company’s common stock.

RISK FACTORS

The Company’s business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks. This section does not describe
all risks applicable to the Company, its industry or its business, and it is intended only as a summary of certain material factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company could be materially and adversely affected.

The Company has grouped these risk factors into three general categories:

•

Risks arising from its business;

•

Risks arising from its capital structure; and

•

Risks arising from its status as a REIT.

Risks Arising from the Company’s Business

The Company is dependent on Kindred; Kindred’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with the Company could
significantly harm the Company and its ability to service its indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to its stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT.

The Company is dependent on Kindred in a number of ways:

•

The Company leases substantially all of its properties to Kindred under the Kindred Master Leases, and therefore:

•

Kindred is the primary source of the Company’s real estate income, accounting for approximately 94.3% of the Company’s total real estate revenues in 2003; and

•

since the Kindred Master Leases are triple-net leases, the Company depends on Kindred to pay for insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses required in
connection with the leased properties.

•

In connection with the 1998 Spin Off, Kindred assumed, and agreed to indemnify the Company for, the following:

•

all obligations under third-party leases and third-party contracts, except for those contracts relating to the Company’s ownership of its properties;

•

all losses, including costs and expenses, resulting from future claims and all liabilities that may arise out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations either
before or after the date of the spin off; and

•

any claims that were pending at the time of the 1998 Spin Off and that arose out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations or were asserted after the 1998 Spin Off
and that arise out of the ownership and operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets or liabilities transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off.

•

The failure of Kindred to make three consecutive payments of rent under any of the Kindred Master Leases constitutes an “event of default” under the 2002 Credit Agreement.

There can be no assurance that Kindred will have
sufficient assets, income and access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with the Company. In addition, any failure by Kindred to effectively conduct its operations could have a material
adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities. Any inability or unwillingness on the part of Kindred to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with the Company could have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. See “Business—Dependence on Kindred.”



Index to Financial Statements

The Company may be unable to find another lessee or operator for its properties if it has to replace
Kindred or its other operators.

The Company may have to
find another lessee/operator for the properties covered by one or more of the Kindred Master Leases or its other operators upon the expiration of the terms of the applicable lease or upon a default by Kindred or its other operators. During any
period that the Company is attempting to locate one or more lessee/operators there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments by Kindred or its other operators. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to locate another
suitable lessee/operator or, if the Company is successful in locating such an operator, that the rental payments from the new operator would not be significantly less than the existing rental payments. The Company’s ability to locate another
suitable lessee/operator and/or evict the existing operator or operators may be materially delayed or limited by various state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules. In addition,
the Company may also incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any such licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. Such delays, limitations and expenses could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and/or
materially delay or impact the Company’s ability to collect rent, to obtain possession of leased properties, or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant default.

The Company may encounter certain risks when implementing its business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or
acquisitions or development of, healthcare-related and/or senior housing properties.

The Company intends to continue to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional healthcare-related or other properties, subject to the contractual restrictions contained in the Indentures
(as defined under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Senior Notes Offering”) and the 2002 Credit Agreement. Acquisitions of and investments
in such properties entail general investment risks associated with any real estate investments, including risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations, the estimates of the cost of improvements necessary for acquired
properties will prove inaccurate, and the inability of the lessee/operator to meet performance expectations. The Company does not presently contemplate any development projects, although if it were to pursue new development projects, such projects
would be subject to numerous risks, including risks of construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs, new project commencement risks such as receipt of zoning, occupancy and other required governmental approvals and permits
and the incurrence of development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion. In addition, the Company may borrow to finance investments in, and/or acquisition or development of, healthcare-related or other properties,
which would increase its leverage.

The Company may acquire
specialty hospitals and other healthcare-related properties not currently in the Company’s portfolio and the Company has less experience evaluating and monitoring such properties.

The Company competes for acquisition or investment opportunities with
entities that have substantially greater financial resources than it has. The Company’s ability to compete successfully for such opportunities is affected by many factors, including its cost of obtaining debt and equity capital at rates
comparable to or better than its competitors. Competition generally may reduce the number of suitable acquisition or investment opportunities available to the Company and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby
impeding its acquisitions, investment or development activities. See “Business—Competition.”

Even if the Company is successful at identifying and competing for acquisition or investment opportunities, such opportunities involve a number of risks,
including diversion of management’s attention, the risk that the value of the properties the Company acquires or invests in could decrease substantially after such acquisition or investment and the risk that the Company will not be able to
accurately assess the value of properties that are not of the type it currently owns, some or all of which could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Additionally, if the Company is successful in continuing to implement its business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or
development of, healthcare-related and/or senior housing properties, the



Index to Financial Statements

Company may continue to increase the number of operators of its properties. Historically, substantially all of the Company’s properties have been
operated by a single operator, Kindred. There can be no assurance that the Company will have the capabilities to successfully monitor and manage a portfolio of properties with a growing number of operators.

The Company is subject to the risks associated with investment in a single
industry: the heavily regulated healthcare industry.

All
of the Company’s investments are in properties used in the healthcare industry; therefore the Company is exposed to risks associated with the healthcare industry in particular. The healthcare industry is highly regulated and changes in
government regulation have in the past had material adverse consequences on the industry in general, which may not even have been contemplated by lawmakers and regulators. There can be no assurance that future changes in government regulation of
healthcare will not have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry, including its lessees. Moreover, the Company’s ability to invest in non-healthcare or non-senior housing related properties is restricted by the terms of the 2002
Credit Agreement. See “Governmental Regulation—Healthcare Regulation.”

The Company’s tenants, including Kindred, may be adversely affected by increasing healthcare regulation and enforcement.

The Company believes that the regulatory environment surrounding the long-term care industry has intensified both in the
amount and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. This is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like Kindred.

The extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include, but are not limited
to, laws and regulations relating to licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior,
and financial and other arrangements which may be entered into by healthcare providers. Federal and state governments have intensified enforcement policies, resulting in a significant increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory
deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, bars on Medicare and Medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. See “Governmental
Regulation—Healthcare Regulation.” If Kindred and the Company’s other tenants and operators fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses, they could become ineligible to
receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, suffer civil and/or criminal penalties and/or be required to make significant changes to their operations. Kindred and the Company’s other tenants also could be
forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. In addition, as part of the settlement agreement Kindred entered into with the federal government, it agreed to
comply with the terms of a corporate integrity agreement. Kindred could incur additional expenses in complying with the corporate integrity agreement, and its failure to comply with the corporate integrity agreement could have a material adverse
effect on Kindred’s results of operations, financial condition and its ability to make rental payments to the Company, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

The Company is unable to predict the future course of federal, state and
local regulation or legislation, including the Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations. Changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on Kindred and the Company’s other operators, which, in turn, could have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Changes in the
reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s tenants.

Kindred and certain of the Company’s other tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors,
including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. See



Index to Financial Statements

“Governmental Regulation—Healthcare Regulation.” There continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to
implement cost-containment measures that limit payments to healthcare providers. In addition, private third-party payors have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be
available for services to be provided by Kindred and other tenants which are currently being reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed
and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of Kindred and certain of the Company’s other operators and tenants, which, in turn, could have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

There also continues to be
state legislative proposals that would impose more limitations on government and private payments to providers of healthcare services such as Kindred. Many states have enacted or are considering enacting measures that are designed to reduce their
Medicaid expenditures and to make certain changes to private healthcare insurance. There are a number of legislative proposals currently under consideration, including cost caps and the establishment of Medicaid prospective payment systems for
nursing centers. Some states also are considering regulatory changes that include a moratorium on the designation of additional LTACs. A federal moratorium was proposed in February 2004, by a joint committee of the United States House of
Representatives and Senate in response to the rapid growth in the number of LTACs and resulting increase in Medicare payments to LTACs. The committee report raises several questions about LTACs and suggests that a temporary moratorium is needed
until the questions can be answered.

There continue to be
various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost-containment measures that limit payments to healthcare providers. In addition, private third-party payors have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs.
There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services to be provided by Kindred and other tenants which are currently being reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits by governmental
and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of Kindred and the Company’s other
operators and other tenants, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. See “Governmental Regulation—Healthcare Regulation.”

Significant legal actions could subject Kindred and the Company’s other operators to increased operating costs and
substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect Kindred’s and the Company’s other operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operation.

Kindred and the Company’s other skilled nursing facility operators have
experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of professional liability claims in recent years. In addition to large compensatory claims, plaintiffs’ attorneys increasingly are seeking significant punitive damages and
attorneys’ fees.

Due to the increase in the number and
severity of professional liability claims against healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has been severely restricted and the premiums on such insurance coverage have increased dramatically. As a result,
Kindred’s and the Company’s other operators’ insurance coverage might not cover all claims against them or continue to be available to them at a reasonable cost. If Kindred or the Company’s other operators are unable to maintain
adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, they may be exposed to substantial liabilities.

Kindred insures its professional liability risks in part through a wholly-owned, limited purpose insurance company. The limited purpose insurance company
insures initial losses up to specified coverage levels per occurrence with no aggregate coverage limit. Coverage for losses in excess of those per occurrence levels is maintained through unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers up to an aggregate
limit. The limited purpose insurance company then insures all claims in excess of the aggregate limit for the unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers. Kindred maintains general liability insurance and professional malpractice liability insurance

in amounts and with deductibles which Kindred management has indicated that it believes are sufficient for its operations.

Operators that insure their professional liability risks through their own
captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of professional liability through actuarial studies which rely primarily on historical data. However, due to the increase in the number and severity of professional claims against
healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims and there can be no assurance that such operators’ reserves for future claims will be adequate to cover the actual cost of such claims. If the actual cost
of such claims are significantly higher than the operators’ reserves, it could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operation of the operator and their ability to make rental payments to the
Company, which in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Kindred and the Company’s other operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute.

Kindred and the Company’s other operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare
industry. See “Government Regulation—Healthcare Regulation.” These lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. If any such lawsuits were to be brought
against Kindred and the Company’s other operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operation of
Kindred and the Company’s other operators and their ability to make rental payments to the Company, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

If any of the Company’s properties are found to be contaminated, or if the Company becomes involved in any
environmental disputes, the Company could incur substantial liabilities and costs.

Under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or
petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. Owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by
regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or
disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. In certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. While the Company is generally indemnified by the current
operators of the Company’s properties for contamination caused by such operators, such indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs. See “Government Regulation—Environmental Regulation.”

Risks Arising from the Company’s Capital Structure

The Company may become more leveraged.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $640.6 million of
indebtedness and approximately $261.8 million in additional borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Indentures permit the Company to incur substantial additional debt, and the Company may borrow additional funds, which may
include secured borrowings. A high level of indebtedness may have the following consequences:

•

a substantial portion of the Company’s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of debt service, thus reducing the funds available for the Company’s
business strategy and for distributions to stockholders;

•

potential limits on the Company’s ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the
real estate and/or healthcare sectors;



Index to Financial Statements

•

a potential impairment of the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing for the its business strategy; and

•

a downgrade in the rating of the Company’s debt securities by one or more rating agencies which could have the effect of, among other things, increasing the cost of its
borrowing.

The Company may be unable to raise
additional capital necessary to continue to implement its business plan and to meet the Company’s debt payments.

In order to continue to implement the Company’s business plan and to meet its debt payments, the Company may need to raise additional capital. The
Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness is restricted by the terms of the Indentures and the 2002 Credit Agreement. In addition, adverse economic conditions could cause the terms on which the Company can obtain additional borrowings
to become unfavorable. In such circumstances, the Company may be required to raise additional equity in the capital markets or liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on the
investments and that could result in adverse tax consequences to the Company. In addition, certain healthcare regulations may constrain the Company’s ability to sell assets. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to meet its
debt service obligations and the failure to do so could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

The Company hedges its floating-rate debt with an interest rate swap and may record charges and incur costs associated with the termination or change
in value of its interest rate swap.

The Company has an
interest rate swap agreement to hedge its existing floating-rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008. The Company periodically assesses its interest rate swap in relation to its outstanding balances of floating-rate debt, and
based on such assessments may terminate portions of its swap or enter into additional swaps. Termination of swaps with accrued losses, or changes in the value of swaps as a result of falling interest rates, would require the payment of costs and/or
result in charges to the Company’s earnings and net worth, which could be significant.

Risks Arising from the Company’s Status as a REIT

Loss of the Company’s status as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to the Company and the value of its common stock.

If the Company loses its status as a REIT, it will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds
available for distribution to its stockholders for each of the years involved because:

•

the Company would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing its taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;

•

the Company also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and

•

unless the Company is entitled to relief under statutory provisions, it could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which it was
disqualified.

In addition, if the Company fails
to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of the Company’s current and accumulated earning and profits, although corporate shareholders may be eligible for the dividends
received deduction and individual shareholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 15%) with respect to distributions. The Company would no longer be required to
pay dividends to maintain REIT status.

As a result of all
these factors, the Company’s failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair its ability to implement its business strategy and would adversely affect the value of the Company’s common stock.



Index to Financial Statements

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for
which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the Company’s control may affect its ability to remain qualified as a REIT. In
addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect the Company’s investors or its ability to remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes. Although the Company believes that it
qualifies as a REIT, there can be no assurance that it will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes.

See “Federal Income Tax Considerations—Federal Income Taxation of the Company” and “—Requirements for Qualification.”

The 90% distribution requirement will decrease the
Company’s liquidity and may limit its ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions.

To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, the Company must make distributions to its
stockholders. See “Federal Income Tax Considerations—Federal Income Taxation of the Company—Requirements for Qualification as a REIT—Distribution Requirements for REIT Qualification.” The terms of the Indentures permit the
Company to make annual distributions to its stockholders in an amount equal to the minimum amount necessary to maintain its REIT status so long as its ratio of Debt to Adjusted Total Assets (as defined in the Indentures) does not exceed 60% and to
make additional distributions if the Company passes certain other financial tests.

Although the Company anticipates that it generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable it to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that from time to time the Company may not have
sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. This may be due to the timing differences between the actual receipt of
income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at its taxable income. In addition, nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or
capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may also cause the Company to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable it to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement.

These distributions may limit the Company’s ability to rely upon rental payments from its properties or subsequently
acquired properties to finance investments, acquisitions or new developments.

In the event that timing differences or other cash needs occur, the Company may find it necessary to borrow funds, issue additional equity securities (although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so),
pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable the Company to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require the Company to raise additional capital to meet
its obligations; however, see “Risk Factors—Risks Arising from the Company’s Capital Structure—the Company may be unable to raise additional capital necessary to continue to implement its business plan and to meet its debt
payments.” The terms of the Indentures and the 2002 Credit Agreement restrict the Company’s ability to engage in some of these transactions.

Properties

The Company believes that it has a diversified portfolio of healthcare facilities in terms of geography and the healthcare services provided at such facilities. The Company believes that the geographic diversity of
the properties makes the portfolio less susceptible to adverse changes in state regulation and regional economic downturns. The long-term acute care hospitals owned or ground leased by the Company primarily provide long-term acute care to medically
complex, chronically ill patients, covering approximately 3,600 beds in 41 hospitals as of December 31, 2003. The Company’s one 29 bed rehabilitation hospital provides high intensity physical,

respiratory, neurological, orthopedic and other treatment protocols for patients during recovery. The nursing facilities owned or ground leased by the
Company are leading providers of rehabilitation services, including physical, occupational and speech therapies, and care for patients with Alzheimer’s disease, covering approximately 24,399 beds in 194 nursing facilities as of December 31,
2003. The other nine facilities owned by the Company include eight personal care facilities and one assisted living facility which provide services including assisted living, neurorehabilitation, neurobehavioral management and vocational programs,
covering approximately 181 beds as of December 31, 2003.

The
Company leases its corporate offices in Louisville, Kentucky and Chicago, Illinois.

Selected Financial Data

The following selected financial data with respect to the Company should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements
and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Index to Financial Statements

(1)

The Company considers funds from operation (“FFO”) an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT and the Company uses the National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts’ (“NAREIT”) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Sates (“GAAP”)), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of
real estate property, plus depreciation for real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the
fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company’s financial performance or as an alternative to
cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company’s liquidity, nor is FFO indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. See “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Funds from Operations.”

ITEM 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and
understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Ventas, Inc. (“Ventas” or the “Company”). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements
and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), which require the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. The Company believes that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets,
primarily consisting of its investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash
flows of the underlying operations. The Company adjusts the net book value of leased properties and other long-lived assets to fair value, if the sum of the expected future cash flow or sales proceeds is less than book value. Future events could
occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded a $0.8 million impairment on one of its non-operating skilled nursing facilities. See
“Note 5—Dispositions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Legal Contingencies

The Company is currently
involved in certain legal proceedings. As described further in “Note 13—Litigation” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings and other matters that arose from the
Company’s operations prior to the time of the Company’s spin-off of Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Kindred”) on May 1, 1998 (the “1998 Spin Off”) or relate to assets or liabilities
transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off. Under the various agreements (the “Spin Agreements”) entered into by the Company and Kindred at the time of the 1998 Spin Off, as such agreements may have been amended and
restated in connection with Kindred’s emergence from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001, Kindred agreed to assume the defense, on behalf of the Company, of any claims



Index to Financial Statements

that (a) were pending at the time of the 1998 Spin Off and which arose out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets or
liabilities transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off, or (b) were asserted after the 1998 Spin Off and which arose out of the ownership and operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets or liabilities transferred to
Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off, and to indemnify the Company for any fees, costs, expenses and liabilities arising out of such operations. Kindred is presently defending the Company in these matters, however, there can be no assurance
that Kindred will continue to defend the Company in such matters or that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy such obligations. A change in Kindred’s ability or willingness to perform under
these commitments could have a Material Adverse Effect (defined below) on the Company.

The Company is also involved in other litigation as further described in “Note 13—Litigation” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is the opinion of management that, except as set forth in
“Note 13—Litigation” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the disposition of such matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and
liquidity of the Company, and on the Company’s ability to make distributions to its stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) (a “Material Adverse Effect”). If
management’s assessment of the Company’s liability with respect to these actions in incorrect, such matters could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

The valuation of derivative instruments requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair value for
the Company’s derivatives are verified with a third party consultant which utilizes pricing models that consider forward yield curves and discount rates. Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements
of the Company are subject to significant estimates which may change in the future.

Income Taxes

For the year ended December 31,
2003, a provision for income tax was not recorded due to the Company’s ability and intention to distribute to its stockholders at least 100% of its estimated 2003 taxable income and to continue to qualify as a REIT.

The Company’s estimation of its 2003 taxable income and the related
quarterly dividends is based on a number of assumptions, including, but not limited to, the following: Kindred performs its obligations under the five master lease agreements pursuant to which the Company leases 41 of its hospitals and 186 of its
skilled nursing facilities to Kindred (the “Kindred Master Leases”), and the Spin Agreements; the Company’s other tenants perform their obligations under their leases with the Company; no capital transactions, acquisitions or
divestitures occur; the Company’s tax and accounting positions do not change; and the number of issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock remain relatively unchanged. These assumptions which impact the estimate of the
Company’s 2003 taxable income are subject to change and many are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company’s expectations regarding future dividends may change.

Although the Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT, it is possible
that economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause the Company to fail, or elect not, to continue to qualify as a REIT. If the Company were to fail, or elect not, to continue to qualify as a REIT in any year, the Company would be
subject to 35% federal income tax and to the applicable state and local income taxes for the affected years. Such tax obligations would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Unless eligible for limited relief, if the Company failed, or
revoked its election, to qualify as a REIT, the Company would not be eligible to elect again to be treated as a REIT before the fifth year after the year of such termination or revocation.

Results of Operations

Effective January 1, 2002 the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144 (“SFAS
144”), “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS 144 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS 144 extends the reporting requirements of
discontinued operations to include components of an entity that have either been disposed or are classified as held for sale. The operating results of properties, that were disposed of subsequent to January 1, 2002, have been reclassified as
discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for each of the three years ended December 31, 2003 included herein. See “Note 5—Dispositions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 1, and Technical Correction” (“SFAS No. 145”). SFAS No. 4, “Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt”
(“SFAS No. 4”), required that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt that were included in the determination of net income be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 that
related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 required the Company to reclassify certain prior period items that no longer meet the extraordinary classification into continuing operations. Additionally, future gains and losses related to debt
extinguishment may be required to be classified as income from continuing operations. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 became effective in fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. As required, on January 1,
2003 the Company adopted SFAS No. 145. In accordance with SFAS No. 145, the Company’s prior year financial statements have been reclassified to include gains and losses from extinguishment of debt in continuing operations. This reclassification
has no effect on the Company’s net income.

Years Ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002

Rental income for the year
ended December 31, 2003 was $191.2 million, of which $183.2 million (95.8%) resulted from the Kindred Master Leases. The rental income from Kindred includes $2.3 million related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of the
Company’s receipt of Kindred common stock (the “Kindred Common Stock”) under the Kindred Plan of Reorganization (the “Final Plan”) on April 20, 2001 and the receipt of $4.5 million of additional future rent under the Kindred
Master Leases. The rental income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $176.0 million, of which $172.9 million (98.3%) resulted from Kindred Master Leases. The $15.2 million increase in rental income reflects (a) the 3.5% increase in the rent
paid under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2003, (b) the $8.6 million increase on annualized rent on certain Kindred facilities effective July 1, 2003 and (c) $6.0 million in additional rent earned during the year ended December 31, 2003
under the master lease (the “THI Master Lease”) with Trans Healthcare, Inc. (“THI”) entered into by the Company and THI on November 4, 2002.

Interest income from the real estate loan receivable was $3.0 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 respectively.
This amount represents interest income received in connection with a mezzanine loan made by the wholly owned operating partnership of the Company, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership (“Ventas Realty”) to THI on November 4, 2002 (the
“THI Mezzanine Loan”).

Interest and other income
totaled approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to approximately $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase is primarily attributable to the recovery of a previously written-off receivable by
the Company. In addition, the Company had increased interest income due to higher cash balances on hand to invest during 2003, which was partially offset by reduced interest rates.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company disposed of the remaining 920,814 shares of Kindred Common Stock and
recognized a gain of $9.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company disposed of 159,500 shares of Kindred Common Stock and recognized a gain of $5.0 million. As of December 31, 2003, the Company did not own any shares of Kindred
Common Stock.



Index to Financial Statements

Expenses totaled $108.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and included $39.7 million of
depreciation expense, $61.8 million of interest on debt financing and $4.9 million of interest on the Company’s settlement with the Department of Justice (“United States Settlement”). Expenses for the year included an offset of $20.2
million resulting from the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability. Expenses totaled $148.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Excluding the $20.2 million offset, expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased
$19.6 million from the same period in 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from (a) a $9.2 million decrease in interest expense, (b) a $11.0 million expense in 2002 related to the loss from the early extinguishment of debt, (c) a $1.6 million
decrease in Swap ineffectiveness, and (d) a $0.5 million decrease in the United States Settlement interest, offset by the net increase of $2.2 million in general and administrative expense and professional fees and a $1.3 million increase in
depreciation expense.

During the year ended December 31, 2003,
the Company reported an increase of approximately $20.2 million to its operating results, reflecting the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability. See “Note 10—Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest expense (inclusive of swap ineffectiveness) excluding
the interest on the United States Settlement decreased $9.2 million to $62.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $72.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Interest expense includes $4.1 million and $3.7 million of amortized
deferred financing costs for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $3.1 million and $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in
interest expense from continuing and discontinued operations was due primarily to (a) a $9.9 million decrease as a result of reduced debt balances, (b) a $0.4 million decrease from reduced interest rates, (c) a $1.6 million decrease in swap
ineffectiveness (See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (d) a $1.5 million decrease from the amortization of a deferred gain recorded in connection with a 1999 transaction to shorten the
maturity of the Company’s 1998 Swap (as defined below) which covered the period between July 1, 2003 and December 31, 2007.

Due to the lower variable rate debt balances incurred by the Company as a result of the sale of ten facilities on December 11, 2003, the Company entered
into an agreement with the counterparty to the Company’s 2003-2008 Swap (defined below) to break $120 million of the $450 million notional amount of the 2003-2008 Swap in exchange for a payment to the counterparty of approximately $8.6 million.
In addition, the Company recognized $3.4 million of a previously deferred gain recorded in connection with a 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of the 1998 Swap. The $5.2 million net expense which was previously reported in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income on the Balance Sheet has been recognized as a net expense in the Statement of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2002 the Company recorded an expense of $5.4 million related to the loss on a $350 million notional swap
breakage (See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

The Company recorded swap ineffectiveness in the Statement of Operations to reflect the value of the excess of the notional amount of the 1998 Swap and
2003-2008 Swap over the Company’s anticipated variable rate debt balance in the future. The Company recorded $0.3 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

In connection with the refinancing of its indebtedness under its prior credit
agreement, in the quarter ended June 30, 2002, the Company incurred a loss from extinguishment of debt of $6.9 million related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with its prior credit agreement. In December 2002, the
Company incurred an additional $4.2 loss related to the repurchase of $34.0 million in Senior Notes (as defined below) consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums paid to repurchase. In connection with the
refinancing of a portion of its indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement (defined below), the Company incurred a loss of approximately $1.3 million related to the partial write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the 2000
Credit Agreement. See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Index to Financial Statements

On June 30, 2003, the Company incurred a $2.7 million expense relating to the early repayment of the
United States Settlement that is reflected as the United States Settlement interest expense on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2003. As required by GAAP, the United States Settlement has been,
since inception, reported on the Company’s balance sheet at an amount that is less than the actual unpaid principal amount under the United States Settlement because the 6% interest rate payable was deemed “below market” at the time
of the settlement. The $2.7 million interest expense reflects the difference between the total amount paid by the Company in final repayment of the United States Settlement and the amount of the United States Settlement reflected on the
Company’s balance sheet on the date of final repayment. There was no prepayment penalty or other charges upon early repayment of the United States Settlement.

General, administrative and professional fee expenses totaled $15.2 million and $12.9 million for the years ended December
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to costs associated with the Company’s initiative to develop and market its strategic diversification program, to improve its overall asset management system, and to
attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve its business objectives.

After discontinued operations of $66.0 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $162.8 million or $2.03 per diluted share. After discontinued operations of
$28.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $65.7 million or $0.93 per diluted share. See “Note 5—Dispositions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Discontinued Operations

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the net income and gain on sale of real
estate for properties sold subsequent to December 31, 2001 are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Discontinued Operations for all periods presented.

On December 11, 2003, the Company completed the sale of ten facilities to Kindred, which facilities had until closing been
leased to Kindred under the Kindred Master Leases, for $79 million in gross cash proceeds. A gain of $54.9 million was recognized and included in Discontinued Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. In addition, Kindred paid the Company a
$6.0 million lease termination fee with respect to such properties. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale and the lease termination fee to pay breakage costs relating to the termination of $120 million notional amount of the
2003-2008 Swap. The remaining net proceeds were used to reduce the Company’s outstanding indebtedness and to fund future acquisitions. See “Recent Developments” and “Note 5—Dispositions.” to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. The assets sold by the Company to Kindred are: two hospitals located in Minnesota and Michigan, and eight skilled nursing facilities located in Kentucky, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Wisconsin. The hospitals contain 332 beds and the
eight skilled nursing facilities contain 1,080 beds.

During
the third quarter ended September 30, 2003, the Company sold a non-operating skilled nursing facility and received a non-binding proposal to purchase another non-operating skilled nursing facility. As a result, the Company recognized a gain of $2.1
million on the sold facility and also recorded a $0.8 million impairment on the other facility.

On June 30, 2003, the Company sold to Kindred 16 skilled nursing facilities, consisting of 15 properties in Florida and one property in Texas, which had
previously been leased to Kindred under the Master Leases, for $59.7 million in gross cash proceeds. A loss of $5.3 million was recognized and included in Discontinued Operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. In addition, Kindred paid the
Company a $4.1 million lease termination fee with respect to such properties. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale and the lease termination fee to repay in full all unpaid amounts under the United States Settlement. The
remaining net proceeds were used to reduce the Company’s outstanding indebtedness. See “Note 5—Dispositions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Index to Financial Statements

In the second quarter ended June 30, 2002, the Company sold a skilled nursing facility to an unrelated
third party and recognized a gain of $1.1 million which was included as a component of Discontinued Operations. On June 20, 2002, the Company sold a 64 licensed bed hospital facility located in Arlington, Virginia to an unrelated third party and
recognized a gain of $22.4 million which was also included as a component of Discontinued Operations. See “Note 5—Dispositions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001

Rental income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $176.0 million, of which $172.9 million (98.3%) resulted from leases
with Kindred. The rental income from Kindred includes $2.3 million related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of the Company’s receipt of the Kindred Common Stock and $4.5 million of additional future rent under the
Kindred Master Leases. The rental income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $170.6 million, of which $168.3 million (98.7%) resulted from leases with Kindred. The $5.4 million increase in rental income consists primarily of (a) the 3.5%
increase in the rent paid under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2002 and (b) additional rent received under the THI Master Lease. The Company reported two months of interest income from the THI Mezzanine Loan and a senior loan of $1.0
million. The senior loan was sold in December 2002. See “Note 6—Mergers and Acquisitions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest and other income totaled approximately $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to approximately $4.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in interest income was primarily the result of lower cash balances and reduced interest rates.

Expenses totaled $148.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and included $38.5 million of depreciation expense and $72.9 million of interest on
debt financing (inclusive of swap ineffectiveness) and $5.5 million of interest on the United States Settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2001, expenses totaled $141.0 million and included $38.2 million of depreciation expense on real estate
assets, $80.2 million of interest on the Company’s prior credit agreement (the “2000 Credit Agreement”) and other debt and $4.6 million of interest on the United States Settlement. The $7.1 million increase in expense consists
primarily of (a) $9.8 million increase in the loss from the extinguishment of debt, (b) an additional expense of $5.4 million related to the loss on a $350 million notional swap breakage (see “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the
Consolidated Financial Statements), (c) a $0.9 million increase in interest on the United States Settlement which was entered into on April 20, 2001, (d) a $0.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization which were offset by (x) a $7.2
million decrease in interest expense and (y) a $2.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses and professional fees.

Interest expense (inclusive of swap ineffectiveness) excluding the interest on the United States Settlement decreased $7.3 million to $72.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002 from $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. $3.1 million of the decrease is primarily a result of reduced principal balances and $7.2 million relates to reduced interest rates resulting from the CMBS
Transaction (as defined below) in December 2001, and the establishment of the 2002 Credit Agreement (as defined below) and the completion of the Senior Notes Offering (as defined below) in April 2002. $1.1 million of the decrease is included in
discontinued operations. The decrease is offset by a $1.9 million “swap ineffectiveness” expense recognized in the Statement of Operations to reflect the value of the excess of the notional amount of the 1998 Swap and 2003-2008 Swap over
the Company’s anticipated variable rate debt balance in the future. See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Professional fees totaled approximately $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $4.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease relates primarily to the reduction in professional fees incurred as a result of the Company’s stabilized operations in 2002 following Kindred’s emergence from bankruptcy in 2001.



Index to Financial Statements

During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded a provision for taxes on the 10% of its
estimated 2001 taxable income that the Company did not distribute. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company filed its 2001 federal income tax return on which it elected to apply certain 2002 dividend payments in excess of its 2002 estimated taxable
net income against such 2001 undistributed taxable net income. As a result, the Company recorded a $2.2 million tax benefit in the third quarter ended September 30, 2002.

In connection with the refinancing of its indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement, the Company incurred a loss of $6.9
million related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the 2000 Credit Agreement. In December 2002, the Company incurred an additional $4.2 loss related to the repurchase of $34.0 million in Senior Notes consisting
of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums paid to repurchase. In connection with the refinancing of a portion of its indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement, the Company incurred a loss of approximately $1.3 million
related to the partial write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the 2000 Credit Agreement. See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company disposed of a total of
159,500 shares of Kindred Common Stock for an average net price of $43.39 per share and recognized a gain of $5.0 million. The Company applied net proceeds of $7.0 million as a prepayment of the Company’s indebtedness under the 2002 Credit
Agreement. As of December 31, 2002, the Company owned 920,814 shares of Kindred Common Stock with a market value of $16.7 million, or $18.15 per share. The Company disposed of 418,186 shares of Kindred Common Stock in the fourth quarter of 2001 and
recognized a gain of $15.4 million on the dispositions.

Discontinued Operations increased $24.6 million to $28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase is primarily attributable to a $22.4 million gain recognized in conjunction with the sale of a 64 licensed bed hospital
facility on June 30, 2002. See “Note 5—Dispositions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Funds from Operations

Funds from operations (“FFO”) for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 totaled $152.6 million, $84.1 million and $92.2 million,
respectively. FFO for the five years ended December 31, 2003 is summarized in the following table (in thousands):

Historical cost
accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have
considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT
and the Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net



Index to Financial Statements

income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus depreciation for real estate assets, and
after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income
(determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company’s financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company’s liquidity, nor is
FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of its consolidated historical operating results, FFO should be examined in
conjunction with net income as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Asset/Liability Management

Asset/liability management is a key element of the Company’s overall risk management program. The objective of asset/liability management is to
support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels. The asset/liability management process focuses on a variety of risks, including market risk (primarily interest rate risk) and credit risk. Effective
management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses the Company’s integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative
financial instruments. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Market Risk

The following discussion of the Company’s exposure to various market risks contains “forward-looking statements” that involve risks and
uncertainties. These projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to the Company. Nevertheless, because of the inherent unpredictability of interest rates as
well as other factors, actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking information.

The Company receives revenue primarily by leasing its assets under leases that are long-term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed
with annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. The Company also earns revenue from the THI Mezzanine Loan. The Company’s obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement are (and its obligations under the 2000 Credit Agreement were)
floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly interest payments vary with the movement in LIBOR. See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The general fixed nature of the
Company’s assets and the variable nature of the Company’s obligations create interest rate risk. If interest rates were to rise significantly, the Company’s lease and other revenue might not be sufficient to meet its debt obligations.
In order to mitigate this risk, in connection with the 1998 Spin Off, the Company entered into a swap (the “1998 Swap”) to effectively convert most of its floating rate debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations. Interest rate swaps
generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments on an underlying notional amount. The 1998 Swap expired on June 30, 2003. See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements—Senior Notes Offering” to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

On September 28, 2001, the Company
entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the “2003-2008 Swap”) in the notional amount of $450.0 million to hedge floating rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008. The 2003-2008 Swap is treated as a cash
flow hedge for accounting purposes. The “2003-2008 Swap” is with a highly rated counterparty in which the Company pays a fixed rate of 5.385% and receives LIBOR from the counterparty. On December 11, 2003, the notional amount of the swap
for the period December 11, 2003 through June 29, 2006 was reduced from $450 million to $330 million. See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. There are no collateral requirements under



Index to Financial Statements

the 2003-2008 Swap. The notional amount of the 2003-2008 Swap is scheduled to decline from $330.0 million as follows:

In accordance with the
terms of the CMBS Loan Agreement (as defined below), on December 11, 2001, Ventas Finance I, LLC (“Ventas Finance”) purchased an interest rate cap from a highly rated counterparty (the “Buy Cap”). See “—Liquidity and
Capital Resources—Credit Facility” and “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Because the Company already hedged its consolidated interest rate risk through the 1998 Swap and the 2003-2008
Swap, on December 11, 2001 the Company sold an interest rate cap (the “Sell Cap”) for the same notional value ($225.0 million) and on the same terms (5 year amortizing 8% LIBOR cap) as the Buy Cap. If LIBOR should exceed the 8% cap, the
Sell Cap would require the Company to pay the counterparty and the Buy Cap would require the counterparty to pay Ventas Finance for the interest accruing in excess of the 8% LIBOR cap. The Buy Cap and the Sell Cap are shown separately as an asset
and a liability on the Company’s balance sheet, respectively. The Company believes that the economic substance of the Buy Cap offsets the net cash flow exposure of the Sell Cap.

When interest rates rise, the interest rate swaps increase in fair value to the Company and when interest rates fall, the
interest rate swaps decline in fair value to the Company. Similarly, when interest rates increase, the Buy Cap increases in fair value and the Sell Cap decreases in fair value. As of December 31, 2003, interest rates had fallen and the 2003-2008
Swap was in an unrealized loss position to the Company. Generally, interest rate swap agreements with longer terms evidence greater dollar values of variation when interest rates change. To highlight the sensitivity of the interest rate swaps and
caps to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points (BPS) in interest rates as of December 31, 2003:

The Company paid $19.2
million under the 1998 Swap and 2003-2008 Swap during the year ended December 31, 2003. Assuming that interest rates do not change, the Company estimates that it will pay approximately $13.3 million on the 2003-2008 Swap during the year ended
December 31, 2004.

The carrying value of the Company’s
variable rate debt approximates fair value. There is no cash flow impact from the fluctuation of interest rates since the Company currently hedges 100% of its variable rate debt. The fair value of the fixed rate debt is $405.6 million based on open
market trading activity provided by a third party.

Credit
Risk

As a result of the 1998 Spin Off, the Company has a
significant concentration of credit risk with Kindred under the Kindred Master Leases. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 lease rental revenues from Kindred totaled $183.2 million or 94.3% and $172.9 or 97.7%, respectively, of the
Company’s total real estate revenue for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2001, lease rental revenues from Kindred comprised 98.7% of the Company’s total lease rental revenues. Accordingly, Kindred’s financial condition and
ability to



Index to Financial Statements

meet its rent obligations will largely determine the Company’s rental revenues and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders. In addition,
any failure by Kindred to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities. Kindred, as well as certain other tenants of the
Company, have experienced financial difficulty and/or filed for bankruptcy. Kindred emerged from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001. Despite Kindred’s emergence from bankruptcy, there can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets,
income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Kindred Master Leases. Since, as of December 31, 2003, the Company derived in excess of 95% of its rental revenues from Kindred and since the Kindred Master Leases are
triple net leases under which Kindred is responsible for all insurance, taxes and maintenance and repair expenses required in connection with the leased properties, the inability or unwillingness of Kindred to satisfy its obligations under the
Kindred Master Leases would have a material adverse effect on the condition of the Kindred leased properties, as well as a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. See “Business—Risk Factors—The Company is dependent on Kindred;
Kindred’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with the Company could significantly harm the Company and its ability to service its indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to its
stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT” and “Note 4—Concentration of Credit Risk” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company monitors its credit risk under its lease agreements with its tenants by,
among other things, reviewing and analyzing (a) information regarding the healthcare industry generally, (b) publicly available information regarding tenants, (c) information provided by the tenants and borrowers under the Company’s lease and
other agreements, and (d) discussion with tenants, borrowers and their representatives.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During 2003
the Company’s principal sources of liquidity came from working capital, cash flow from operations, borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement, disposition of real estate assets, sale of Kindred common stock, proceeds from stock option
exercises, and disbursements from a previously established tax escrow.

The Company intends to continue to fund future investments through cash flow from operations, borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement, disposition of assets and issuance of secured or unsecured long-term debt or other securities. As of
December 31, 2003 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $82.1 million, restricted cash of $7.6 million (comprised of $5.0 million of reserves under the CMBS Loan (as defined below), escrows under the THI Master Lease and the Company’s
portion of the amounts on deposit pursuant to the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement with Kindred (the “Tax Refund Escrow Agreement”)), and unused revolving credit availability of $261.8 million under its revolving credit facility
(“Revolving Credit Facility”) established by the 2002 Credit Agreement. Through the pledge of additional property as collateral to the lenders under the 2002 Credit Agreement, the Company, as of December 31, 2003, could have increased
revolving credit availability to $290.0 million.

Net cash
provided by operations totaled $137.4 million, $116.4 million and $79.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 cash flows is primarily a result of (a) increases from rent escalators, (b)
proceeds from lease termination fees, (c) release of funds from a previously established escrow account (see Note 10—“Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and (d) reduction of interest expense.

Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31,
2003 was $159.7 million. The Company received $139.2 million in proceeds from the disposal of real estate properties, which includes (a) $58.9 million from the sale of 16 properties to Kindred in June 2003, (b) $78.0 million from the sale of ten
facilities to Kindred in December 2003 and (c) $2.3 million from the sale of a non-operating skilled nursing facility. See “Note 5—Dispositions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2003 also included $20.2 million in proceeds from the sale of the Kindred Common Stock. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $34.1 million. The Company



Index to Financial Statements

invested $53.0 million in real property and $64.9 million in loan financing from the THI Transaction (defined in “Note 6—Mergers and
Acquisitions—Transactions with Trans Healthcare, Inc.” to the Consolidated Financial Statements) which was financed through borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement. Investing activities also included $49.0 million in proceeds from the
sale of the THI Senior Loan (defined in “Note 6—Mergers and Acquisitions—Transactions with Trans Healthcare, Inc.” to the Consolidated Financial Statements), $28.6 million from the sale of real property and $7.0 million from the
sale of Kindred Common Stock.

Net cash used in financing
activities totaled $217.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The uses included (a) an aggregate principal payment of $67.1 million on the 2002 Credit Agreement and the CMBS Loan, (b) $37.4 million payment in 2003 for the settlement of the
repurchase of the Senior Notes that occurred on December 31, 2002, (c) $8.6 million in Swap breakage fees, (d) full repayment on the United States Settlement of $46.6 million and (e) $80.2 million of cash dividend payments. The uses were offset by
$22.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock as a result of exercise of stock options. Net cash used in financing totaled $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The uses include (a) an net of $106.7 million payment of
principal on the 2000 Credit Agreement, the 2002 Credit Agreement and the CMBS Loan, (b) $15.1 million in financing fees, (c) $12.8 million in swap breakage costs, (d) $50.1 million of cash dividend payments, and (e) $10.8 million of principal
payments on the United States Settlement. The financing uses are offset by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $97.2 million, including the net proceeds of $93.6 million from the issuance of nine million shares (the “Equity
Offering”) and $3.6 million from the exercise of stock options. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled $151.5 million and included payments of principal on the 2000 Credit Agreement in the aggregate
amount of $263.0 million. $212.8 million of the payments were funded from the CMBS Transaction (as defined below), which generated gross proceeds of $225 million. The 2001 financing activities also included $6.9 million in financing costs, $41.7
million payment on the United States Settlement, and $65.3 million of cash dividend payments.

On December 31, 2002, the Company repurchased through open market purchases $34.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes out of the proceeds of the Equity Offering, consisting of $783,000 of 2009 Senior Notes (as
defined below) and $33,179,000 of 2012 Senior Notes (as defined below). The total purchase price aggregated $37.4 million. As a result of these purchases, the Company reported a loss from the extinguishment of debt of $4.2 million in the fourth
quarter ended December 31, 2002.

On February 5, 2004, the
Company consummated a merger transaction in which the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of ElderTrust in an all cash transaction valued at $184 million. See “Note 6—Mergers and Acquisitions” to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

On January 28, 2004, the Company entered
into 14 definitive purchase agreements with third party sellers to purchase a total of 14 independent and assisted living facilities for $115 million. On January 28, 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of four of the 14 properties for a
purchase price of $37 million. See “Note 6—Mergers and Acquisitions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CMBS Transaction

On December 12, 2001, the Company raised $225.0 million in gross proceeds from the completion of a commercial mortgage backed securitization transaction
(the “CMBS Transaction”). Under a Loan and Security Agreement dated as of December 12, 2001 (the “CMBS Loan Agreement”), Ventas Finance obtained a loan in the principal amount of $225.0 million (the “CMBS Loan”) from
Merrill Lynch Mortgage Lending, Inc., as lender (the “CMBS Lender”). The CMBS Loan bears interest at a weighted average of LIBOR plus 1.4853%. Principal of and interest on the CMBS Loan is payable monthly. The CMBS Loan matures on December
9, 2006, at which time a principal balloon payment of approximately $206.3 million will be due, assuming all scheduled amortization payments are made and no prepayments are made on the CMBS Loan. The CMBS Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at
any time and from time to time without penalty or premium.



Index to Financial Statements

The CMBS Loan is secured by liens on 39 skilled nursing facilities (the “CMBS Properties”)
transferred by Ventas Realty to Ventas Finance and leased to Kindred under a Kindred Master Lease (the “Kindred CMBS Master Lease”). Except for certain customary exceptions, the CMBS Loan is non-recourse to Ventas Finance and the Company.
See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The 2002 Credit Agreement

On April 17, 2002 (the “2002 Refinancing Date”), the Company, as guarantor, and Ventas Realty, as borrower, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (the “2002 Credit
Agreement”). Under the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty obtained a $350.0 million credit facility (the “Total Commitments”) consisting of a $60.0 million term loan (the “Tranche B Term Loan”) and the $290.0 million
Revolving Credit Facility. The 2002 Credit Agreement also permits Ventas Realty to obtain an additional term loan in an amount of not less than $50.0 million, but not more than the remaining unused portion of the Total Commitments, subject to the
conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement (the “Tranche C Term Loan”). Subject to the terms of, and the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in, the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty has the option to increase the Total
Commitments (in the form of term and/or revolving loans) to an amount not to exceed $450.0 million.

Borrowings outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement bear interest at an Applicable Percentage over either (i) a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the
higher of (a) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement) in effect for the relevant period, plus one half of one percent (0.5%) and (b) the Prime Rate (as defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement) in effect for the relevant period
(the “Base Rate”) or (ii) a fluctuating LIBOR-based rate per annum (the “Eurodollar Rate”). The Applicable Percentage varies based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement). With
respect to Tranche B Term Loans, the Applicable Percentage is (a) 2.50% for loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate, and (b) 1.00% for loans bearing interest at the Base Rate. With respect to revolving loans under the Revolving Credit
Facility, from the inception of the loan through April 6, 2003, the Applicable Percentages were 2.75% for Eurodollar Rate loans and 1.25% for Base Rate loans. Because of the Company’s improved credit statistics, effective April 7, 2003, the
Applicable Percentages under the Revolving Credit Facility were reduced to 2.50% for Eurodollar Rate loans and 1.00% for Base Rate loans.

Loans outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement are pre-payable without premium or penalty, provided that loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate
are subject to customary “breakage” costs if repaid prior to the end of an interest period.

The Company (and any other owner of mortgaged property securing Ventas Realty’s obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement from time to time) has
guaranteed Ventas Realty’s obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement. Such obligations are secured by liens on certain of Ventas Realty’s real property assets and any related leases, rents and personal property, and, at Ventas
Realty’s option, may be secured by certain cash collateral from time to time. Currently, 54 real properties owned by Ventas Realty are mortgaged to secure the 2002 Credit Agreement (the “Borrowing Base Properties”). As of December 31,
2003, the carrying value of the 54 Borrowing Base Properties was $161.6 million. All 54 Borrowing Base Properties are leased to Kindred pursuant to Master Lease No. 1.

The Borrowing Base under the 2002 Credit Agreement is, as determined at any time, an amount equal to the sum of (i)
sixty-five percent (65%) of the aggregate appraised property value of the Borrowing Base Properties, plus (ii) one hundred percent (100%) of amounts on deposit in certain cash collateral or pledged accounts. The aggregate principal amount of the
obligations outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement (including the revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Tranche B Term Loan and the Tranche C Term Loan) may not at any time exceed the Borrowing Base. As of December 31, 2003,
the Borrowing Base was $320.9 million, and the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement was $59.1 million, and the remaining availability under the 2002 Credit Agreement was $261.8 million. Ventas



Index to Financial Statements

Realty may at any time include additional real estate assets (which must satisfy certain conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement) in the Borrowing
Base to increase its remaining availability, up to the Total Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty may also obtain a release of various Borrowing Base Properties from the liens and
security interests encumbering such properties. See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Senior Notes Offering

On the 2002 Refinancing Date, Ventas Realty and Ventas Capital Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ventas Realty (collectively, the
“Issuers”), completed the offering (the “Senior Notes Offering”) of 8


/


% Senior Notes due
2009 in the aggregate principal amount of $175.0 million (the “2009 Senior Notes”) and 9% Senior Notes due 2012 in the aggregate principal amount of $225.0 million (the “2012 Senior Notes” and, together with the 2009 Senior
Notes, the “Senior Notes”). The 2009 Senior Notes and the 2012 Senior Notes were issued under separate Indentures, each dated as of April 17, 2002 (collectively, the “Indentures”) and mature on May 1, 2009 and May 1, 2012,
respectively. As of December 31, 2003, $174.2 million principal amount was outstanding under the 2009 Senior Notes and $191.8 million principal amount was outstanding under the 2012 Senior Notes.

The Indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants. See “Note
7—Borrowing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Dividends

In order to
continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company must make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90% of its “REIT taxable income” (excluding net capital gain). The Company declared dividends greater than 100% of its estimated
taxable income for 2003. The Company intends to pay a dividend for 2004 greater than 100% of the Company’s taxable income for 2004.

It is expected that the Company’s REIT taxable income will be less than its cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non-cash
deductions in computing REIT taxable income. The Company anticipates that it generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable it to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. It is possible, however, that the Company, from time to time,
may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation.

Capital Expenditures and Property Acquisitions

Capital expenditures to maintain and improve the leased properties generally will be incurred by the Company’s tenants.
Accordingly, the Company does not believe that it will incur any major expenditures in connection with the leased properties. After the terms of the leases expire, or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations
under the leases, the Company anticipates that any expenditures relating to the maintenance of leased properties for which it may become responsible will be funded by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings. To the extent that
unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required, the Company’s liquidity may be affected adversely. The Company’s ability to make expenditures and borrow funds is restricted by the terms of the 2002 Credit Agreement and
the Indentures.

Shelf Registration Statement and Equity
Offering

On June 19, 2002, the Company filed a universal
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to $750.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares and warrants. The registration statement became effective on July 8,
2002 and was



Index to Financial Statements

amended August 13, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, $651.0 million of these securities remained available for offering under the shelf registration statement.

During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002, the Company
commenced and completed an equity offering of the Company’s common stock with Tenet Healthcare Corporation (“Tenet”). Immediately prior to the completion of the Equity Offering, Tenet held 8,301,067 shares of the Company’s common
stock. The Equity Offering consisted of 9,000,000 newly issued shares of common stock sold by the Company and 8,301,067 shares of the Company’s common stock owned and sold by Tenet, all priced at $11.00 per share. After the Equity Offering,
Tenet held no shares of the Company’s common stock. The net proceeds received by the Company from its sale of its newly issued common stock were $93.6 million and were used to repay outstanding indebtedness, including the indebtedness incurred
by the Company to invest in the THI Transaction.

Agreement
of Indemnity—Third-Party Leases and Contracts

In
connection with the 1998 Spin Off, the Company assigned its former third party lease obligations and third party guarantee agreements to Kindred. The Company believes that the aggregate exposure under its third party lease obligations is
approximately $31.2 million. The Company believes that it has no material exposure under the third party guarantee agreements. See “Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other

In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a $96.5 million charge related to the United States Settlement. Under
the United States Settlement, the Company was required to pay $103.6 million to the federal government, of which $34.0 million was paid on April 20, 2001, the date the Final Plan became effective. The balance of $69.6 million bore interest at 6% per
annum and was payable in equal quarterly installments over a five-year term commencing on June 30, 2001. The charge in the fourth quarter of 2000 was discounted for accounting purposes based on an imputed borrowing rate of 10.75%. The Company was
required to pay $16.2 million in principal and interest in 2003 under the United States Settlement. On June 30, 2003, the Company prepaid in full the principal amount owed on the United States Settlement. There was no prepayment penalty or
other charges payable on account of the early repayment.

The
Company has outstanding loans with interest provisions of approximately $3.8 million, net of repayments, to certain current and former executive officers of the Company to finance the income taxes payable by them as a result of the vesting of common
stock of the Company awarded as compensation to such officers and the 1998 Spin Off. The loans are payable over periods ranging from a four to a ten year period beginning in each case on the date such loan was made. See “Note 15—Related
Party Transactions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In connection with the Company’s spin off of Kindred in 1998, the
Company assigned its former third party lease obligations to Kindred (the “Third Party Leases”). Kindred and its subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and against all claims against the Company arising
out of the Third Party Leases. The Company does not expect to incur any liability under the Third Party Leases. However, there can be no assurance Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy, or that
it will continue to honor, its obligations under the indemnity agreement relating to the Third Party Leases. See “Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Stockholders and Board of Directors

Ventas, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ventas, Inc.
as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Ventas, Inc.
at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt in 2003, changed its method of accounting for disposal of long-lived assets in 2002, and changed its method of accounting for derivative instruments in 2001.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1—Description of Business

Ventas,
Inc. (“Ventas” or the “Company”) is a healthcare real estate investment trust (“REIT”) with a geographically diverse portfolio of healthcare and senior housing facilities. As of December 31, 2003, this portfolio
consisted of 42 hospitals, 194 nursing facilities and nine other healthcare and senior housing facilities in 37 states. The Company leases these facilities to healthcare operating companies under “triple-net” leases. As of December 31,
2003, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Kindred”) lease 186 of the Company’s nursing facilities and all but one of the Company’s hospitals. The Company also has investments relating to 25 healthcare
and senior housing facilities located in Ohio and Maryland. The Company operates in one segment which consists of financing, owning and leasing healthcare-related and senior housing facilities. See “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies.” See “Note 6—Mergers and Acquisitions” for a description of certain transactions occurring after December 31, 2003. Unless otherwise stated, the information presented herein does not give effect to transactions closed
after December 31, 2003.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company
conducted substantially all of its business through a wholly owned operating partnership, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership (“Ventas Realty”) and an indirect, wholly owned limited liability company, Ventas Finance I, LLC (“Ventas
Finance”). As of December 31, 2003, Ventas Finance owned 39 of the Company’s skilled nursing facilities, the Company owned two of the hospitals and Ventas Realty owned all of the Company’s other properties and investments.

Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 5” (“FIN No. 46”). FIN No. 46 requires the consolidation of variable interest entities in
which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. FIN No. 46 is
effective for financial statements issued for the first period ending after March 15, 2004. The Company does not expect the adoption of FIN No. 46 to have any impact on the Company’s presentation of its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 1, and Technical Correction” (“SFAS No. 145”). SFAS No. 4, “Reporting Gains and Losses from
Extinguishment of Debt” (“SFAS No. 4”), required that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt that were included in the determination of net income be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item. The
provisions of SFAS No. 145 that related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 required the Company to reclassify certain prior period items that no longer meet the extraordinary classification into continuing operations. Additionally, future gains and
losses related to debt extinguishment may be required to be classified as income from continuing operations. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 became effective in fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. As
required, on January 1, 2003 the Company adopted SFAS No. 145. In accordance with SFAS No. 145, the Company’s prior year financial statements have been reclassified to include gains and losses from extinguishment of debt in continuing
operations. This reclassification has no effect on the Company’s net income.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure” (“SFAS No. 148”). SFAS No. 148 provides transition methods for entities that
elect to adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 requires disclosure of comparable information regarding the Company’s method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation
for all interim periods. The Company has stock-based employee compensation plans

F-7


Index to Financial Statements

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

which are described in “Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity and Stock Options.” The Company accounts for these plans under the intrinsic method
of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB Opinion No. 25”), and related interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost for options is reflected in net income, as
all options granted under the Company’s plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant. FASB recently announced that rulemaking to expense stock options would be delayed until the
third quarter 2004. The Company intends to adopt the fair value method of accounting at such time as FASB adopts final rules regarding the appropriate valuation methods. In addition, the Company grants shares of restricted stock to certain officers
and directors. Shares of restricted stock vest cumulatively in two to four equal annual installments beginning either on the date of the grant or on the first anniversary of the date of the grant. In accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No.
25, compensation expense is recognized for these restricted stock grants over these vesting periods.

Derivative Instruments

In June of 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138 “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities,” which amends SFAS
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS No. 133”). SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value.
As discussed in “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements,” the Company uses derivative instruments to protect against the risk of interest rate movements on future cash flows under its variable rate debt agreements. On January 1, 2001, the
Company adopted SFAS No. 133, and at that time, designated anew the derivative instruments in accordance with the requirements of the new standard. The adoption of the standard as of January 1, 2001 resulted in the recognition of a liability of $4.1
million to reflect the fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap agreement and an identical reduction to other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders’ equity. In addition, the $21.6 million deferred gain recognized on a
terminated derivative position (See “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements”) was reclassified to other comprehensive income, resulting in a cumulative adjustment to other comprehensive income of $17.5 million. SFAS No. 133 may increase
or decrease reported net income and stockholders’ equity prospectively, depending on future levels of interest rates, the computed “effectiveness” of the derivatives, as that term is defined by SFAS No. 133, and other variables
affecting the fair values of derivative instruments and hedged items, but will have no effect on cash flows. The Company reports its derivative instruments at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
deemed to be eligible for hedge accounting are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income exclusive of ineffectiveness amounts which are reported in the Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2003, an $18.3 million net unrealized loss
on the derivatives is included in Accumulated Comprehensive Income. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are not eligible for hedge accounting are reported in the Statement of Operations. See “Note 8—Fair Values of
Financial Instruments.” Fair value of derivative instruments are estimated by a third party consultant.

Discontinued Operations

In accordance with SFAS 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets,” (“SFAS 144”) effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, the results of operations and gain/(loss) on real estate properties sold or held for sale subsequent to December 31, 2001 are reflected in the consolidated statements of
operations as “Discontinued Operations” for all periods presented. Interest expense allocated to Discontinued Operations has been estimated based on a proportional allocation of rental income among all of the Company’s facilities.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company,
Ventas Realty, Ventas Finance and all direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Real Estate Investments

Investments in real estate properties are recorded at cost. The Company
accounts for acquisitions using the purchase method. The cost of the properties acquired is allocated among tangible land, buildings and equipment and recognized intangibles based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 141, “Business Combinations”. Recognized intangibles include the value of acquired lease contracts. In computing the value of acquired lease contracts, consideration is given to (a) whether the lease is at market rates, (b) origination
fees typically incurred to negotiate a contract, and (c) recovery costs to replace the tenant. Depreciation for buildings is recorded on the straight-line basis, using estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 50 years

Impairment of Assets

Provisions for impairment losses related to long-lived assets, if any, are
recognized when expected future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the assets. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relationship to the future
undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. The Company adjusts the net book value of leased properties and other long-lived assets to fair value, if the sum of the expected future cash flow or sales proceeds is less than net book value.
During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded a $0.8 million impairment on one of its non-operating skilled nursing facilities. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company did not recognize an impairment loss.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity date
of three months or less when purchased. These investments are stated at cost which approximates fair value.

Loan Receivable

The loan receivable is stated at the unpaid principal balance net of deferred origination fees. Net deferred origination fees are comprised of loan fees
collected from the borrower net of certain direct costs. Net deferred origination fees are amortized over the contractual life of the loan using the level yield method. Interest income on the loans receivable is recorded as earned. The Company
evaluates the collectibility of the loan receivable based on, among other things (a) corporate and facility level financial and operational reports, (b) compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the applicable loan documents and (c) the
financial stability of the applicable borrower and any guarantor.

Comprehensive Income

SFAS 130,
“Reporting Comprehensive Income,” establishes guidelines for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in financial statements. Comprehensive income includes net income and all other non-owner changes in
stockholders’ equity during a period including unrealized gains and losses on equity securities classified as available–for-sale and unrealized fair value adjustments on certain derivative instruments.

Marketable Equity Securities

Marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and
reported on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. As of December 31, 2002, a $5.5 million unrealized gain relating to the

F-9


Index to Financial Statements

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Kindred common stock (“Kindred Common Stock”) owned by the Company is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. As of December 31, 2003,
the Company did not own any marketable equity securities.

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing
costs are amortized as a component of interest expense over the terms of the related borrowings using a method that approximates a level yield, and are net of accumulated amortization of approximately $7.4 million and $3.4 million at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

Rental revenue is recognized as earned over the terms of
the related leases which are treated as operating leases. Such income includes periodic increases, if any, based on pre-determined formulas as defined in the lease agreements. Certain leases with tenants other than Kindred contain provisions
relating to increases in rental payments over the terms of the leases. Rental income under these leases is recognized over the term of each lease on a straight-line basis.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of rental revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Segment Reporting

The Company has one primary
reportable segment, which consists of investment in real estate. The Company’s primary business is financing, owning and leasing healthcare-related and senior housing facilities and leasing or subleasing such facilities to third parties,
primarily Kindred. See “Note 4—Concentration of Credit Risk.” All of the Company’s leases are triple-net leases, which require the tenants to pay all property related expenses. The Company does not operate these facilities nor
does it allocate capital to maintain the properties. Substantially all depreciation and interest expenses, except for interest expense relating to the United States Settlement (as defined in “Note 11—Commitments and
Contingencies—Settlement of United States Claims”), reflected in the consolidated statement of operations relate to the ownership of the Company’s investment in real estate.

Note 3—Revenues from Properties

Approximately 94.3% of the Company’s total real estate revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2003 was derived from the four amended and restated master lease agreements dated as of April 20, 2001 between Ventas Realty and Kindred (the “Kindred Amended Master Leases”) and the master lease agreement dated as
of December 12, 2001 between Ventas Finance and Kindred (the “Kindred CMBS Master Lease,” and, collectively with the Kindred Amended Master Leases, the “Kindred Master Leases”).

Each Kindred Master Lease is a “triple-net lease” pursuant to which
Kindred is required to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance and repairs related to the properties. There are several renewal bundles of properties under each Kindred Master Lease, with each bundle containing a varying number of
properties. All properties within a bundle have primary terms ranging from 10 to 15 years from May 1, 1998, subject to certain exceptions, and are subject to three five-year renewal terms.

F-10


Index to Financial Statements

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Under each Kindred Master Lease, the aggregate annual rent is referred to as Base Rent (as defined in
each Kindred Master Lease). Base Rent escalates on May 1 of each year at an annual rate of 3.5% over the Prior Period Base Rent (as defined in the Kindred Master Leases) if certain Kindred revenue parameters are met. Assuming such Kindred revenue
parameters are met, annual Base Rent under the Kindred Master Leases will be $193.6 million from May 1, 2004 to April 30, 2005.

On July 1, 2003, the Company and Kindred amended the Kindred Master Leases to increase rent on certain facilities under the Kindred Master Leases by $8.6
million per year on an annualized basis (May 1, 2003-April 30, 2004), for approximately seven years. This amount will escalate 3.5% annually in accordance with the Kindred Master Leases. In addition, the Kindred Master Leases were amended to: (1)
provide that all annual escalators under the Kindred Master Leases will be in cash at all times and (2) expand certain cooperation and information sharing provisions of the Kindred Master Leases.

The future contracted minimum rentals, excluding rent escalations and
excluding the amortization of the value of the Kindred common stock and the $4.5 million in cash received on April 20, 2001, the date the Kindred Plan of Reorganization (the “Final Plan”) became effective (the “Kindred Effective
Date”), but with normalized rents where applicable, for the remainder of the initial terms of the Kindred Master Leases and the Company’s leases with tenants other than Kindred are as follows:

The Company has a
one-time right to reset the rents under the Kindred Master Lease (the “Reset Right”), exercisable during a one-year period commencing on July 19, 2006 by notice given on or after January 20, 2006 on a Kindred Master Lease by Kindred Master
Lease basis, to a then fair market rental rate, for a total fee of $5.0 million payable on a pro-rata basis at the time of exercise under the applicable Kindred Master Lease. The Reset Right under the Kindred CMBS Master Lease (defined in “Note
7—Borrowing Arrangements—CMBS Transaction”) can only be exercised in conjunction with the exercise of the Reset Right under Kindred Master Lease No. 1. The Company cannot exercise the Reset Right under the Kindred CMBS Master Lease
without the prior written consent of the CMBS Lender (defined in “Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements—CMBS Transaction”) if, as a result of such reset, the aggregate rent payable for the CMBS Properties (defined in “Note
7—Borrowing Arrangements—CMBS Transaction”) would decrease.

Note 4—Concentration of Credit Risk

As
of December 31, 2003, 69.4% of the Company’s real estate properties related to skilled nursing facilities, based on the original cost of such investments. The remaining real estate properties consist of hospitals, assisted living facilities and
personal care facilities and real estate loans. The Company’s facilities are located in 37 states with rental revenues from operations in only one state accounting for more than ten percent (10%) of the Company’s rental revenues.
Approximately 93.8% of the Company’s real estate properties, based on the original cost of such investments, are operated by Kindred and approximately 94.3% of total real estate revenue in 2003 was derived from the Kindred Master Leases.

F-11


Index to Financial Statements

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Because the Company leases substantially all of its properties to Kindred and Kindred is the primary
source of the Company’s real estate revenues, Kindred’s financial condition and ability and willingness to satisfy its rent obligations under the Kindred Master Leases and certain other agreements with the Company will significantly impact
the Company’s revenues and its ability to service its indebtedness and to make distributions to its stockholders. On September 13, 1999, Kindred filed for protection under the Bankruptcy Code with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
District of Delaware, and the Final Plan became effective and Kindred emerged from bankruptcy on the Effective Date. Despite Kindred’s emergence from bankruptcy, there can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and
access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Kindred Master Leases or that Kindred will perform its obligations under the Kindred Master Leases. The inability or unwillingness of Kindred to satisfy its obligations under the
Kindred Master Leases would have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity of the Company, on the Company’s ability to service its indebtedness and on the Company’s ability to make
distributions to its stockholders as required to maintain its status as a REIT (a “Material Adverse Effect”).

Note 5—Dispositions

In accordance with SFAS 144 effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, the results of operations and
gain/(loss) on real estate properties sold or held for sale subsequent to December 31, 2001 are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as “Discontinued Operations” for all periods presented. Interest expense allocated to
Discontinued Operations has been estimated based on a proportional allocation of rental income among all of the Company’s facilities.

On June 30, 2003, the Company completed the sale of 16 skilled nursing facilities in Florida and Texas to Kindred, which had been leasing those properties
from the Company, for $58.9 million in net cash proceeds. A loss of $5.3 million was recognized and included in Discontinued Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. In addition, Kindred paid the Company a $4.1 million lease termination fee.
The Company used the net proceeds to repay in full all unpaid amounts under the Company’s settlement agreement with the Department of Justice (the “United States Settlement”). The remaining net proceeds were used to reduce the
Company’s debt balances.

On December 11, 2003, the
Company completed the sale of an additional ten under-performing facilities to Kindred, which leased and operated those facilities prior to the sale, for $77.8 million, net of transaction costs. A gain of $54.9 million was recognized and included in
Discontinued Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. The Company has also received from Kindred a $6 million lease termination fee on the sold facilities. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale and the lease termination fee to pay
breakage costs relating to the termination of $120 million notional amount of the 2003-2008 Swap (defined below), to reduce debt, and to fund other general corporate obligations.

During the third quarter ended September 30, 2003, the Company sold a non-operating skilled nursing facility for $2.3
million net of transaction costs and received a non-binding proposal to purchase another non-operating skilled nursing facility. As a result, the Company recognized a gain of $2.1 million on the sold facility and also recorded a $0.8 million
impairment on the other facility.

As of December 31, 2002, the
net book value of the facilities sold and held for sale during 2003 was $91.7 million.

On March 13, 2002, the Company sold a skilled nursing facility for $1.8 million and recognized a gain of $1.1 million which was reported as a component of Discontinued Operations. The Company applied net proceeds of
$1.5 million as a prepayment of the Company’s indebtedness under the Company’s prior credit agreement (the “2000 Credit Agreement”). On June 21, 2002, the Company sold a hospital facility and recognized a gain of

F-12

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

approximately $22.4 million. The Company applied net proceeds of $27.1 million as a prepayment of the Company’s indebtedness under the 2002 Credit
Agreement (defined below).

Set forth below is a summary of the
results of operations of the sold and held for sale facilities during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in thousands):

Note 6—Mergers and
Acquisitions

ElderTrust Merger

On February 5, 2004, the Company consummated a merger transaction in an all
cash transaction valued at $184 million (the “ElderTrust Transaction”).

The ElderTrust Transaction adds nine assisted living facilities, one independent living facility, five skilled nursing facilities, two medical office buildings and a financial office building (the “ElderTrust
Properties”) to the Company’s portfolio. The ElderTrust Properties are leased by the Company to various operators under leases providing for aggregated, annual cash base rent of approximately $16.2 million, subject to escalation as
provided in the leases. The leases have remaining terms primarily ranging from four to 11 years. At the closing of the ElderTrust Transaction, the Company also acquired all of the limited partnership units in ElderTrust Operating Limited Partnership
(“ETOP”) directly from their owners at $12.50 per unit, excluding 31,455 Class C Units in ETOP (which will remain outstanding). ETOP owns directly or indirectly all of the ElderTrust Properties.

The Company funded the $101 million equity portion of the purchase price with
cash on ElderTrust’s balance sheet, a portion of the $85 million in proceeds from its December 2003 sale of ten facilities to Kindred and draws on the Company’s revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) under
its Second Amended and Restated Security and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2002 (the “2002 Credit Agreement”). The Company’s ownership of the ElderTrust Properties is subject to approximately $83 million of property level
debt and other liabilities. At the close of the ElderTrust Transaction, ElderTrust had approximately $33.5 million in unrestricted and restricted cash on hand.

The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method. The following table summarizes the preliminary estimated fair values of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. Such estimates are subject to refinement as additional valuation information is received. Operations from this merger

F-13


Index to Financial Statements

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

will be reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to the acquisition date of February 5, 2004. The Company is
in the process of computing fair values, thus, the allocation of the purchase price is subject to refinement.

Transaction with
Brookdale

On January 29, 2004, the Company entered into
14 definitive purchase agreements (each, a “Brookdale Purchase Agreement”) with certain affiliates of Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. (“Brookdale”) to purchase (each such purchase, a “Brookdale Acquisition”) a total
of 14 independent living or assisted living facilities (each, a “Brookdale Facility”) for an aggregate purchase price of $115 million. Affiliates of Brookdale have agreed to lease and operate the Brookdale Facilities pursuant to one or
more triple-net leases. All of the Brookdale leases, which have an initial term of 15 years, will be guaranteed by Brookdale and provide for aggregated annual base rent of approximately $10 million, escalating each year by the greater of (i) 1.5% or
(ii) 75% of the consumer price index.

The Company expects
to fund the Brookdale Acquisitions by assuming an aggregate of approximately $41 million of non-recourse property level debt on certain of the Brookdale Facilities, with the balance to be paid from cash on hand and/or draws on the Revolving
Credit Facility. The property level debt encumbers seven of the Brookdale Facilities.

On January 29, 2004, the Company completed the acquisitions of four Brookdale Facilities for an aggregate purchase price of $37 million. The Company’s acquisition of the remaining ten Brookdale Facilities is
expected to be completed shortly, subject to customary closing conditions. However, the consummation of each such Brookdale Acquisition is not conditioned upon the consummation of any other such Brookdale Acquisition and there can be no assurance
which, if any, of such remaining Brookdale Acquisitions will be consummated or when they will be consummated.

Transactions with Trans Healthcare, Inc.

On November 4, 2002, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Ventas Realty, completed a $120.0 million transaction (the “THI
Transaction”) with Trans Healthcare, Inc., a privately owned long-term care and hospital company (“THI”). The THI Transaction was structured as a $53.0 million sale leaseback transaction (the “THI Sale Leaseback”) and a
$67.0 million loan (the “THI Loan”), comprised of a first mortgage loan (the “THI Senior Loan”) and a mezzanine loan (the “THI Mezzanine Loan”). Following a sale of the THI Senior Loan in December 2002 (see below), the
Company’s investment in THI was $70.0 million.

F-14


Index to Financial Statements

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

As part of the THI Sale Leaseback, Ventas Realty purchased 5 properties and is leasing them back to
THI under a “triple-net” master lease (the “THI Master Lease”). The properties subject to the Sale Leaseback are four skilled nursing facilities and one continuing care retirement community. The THI Master Lease, which has an
initial term of ten years, provides for annual base rent of $5.9 million. The THI Master Lease provides that if THI meets specified revenue parameters, annual base rent will escalate each year by the greater of (i) three percent or (ii) 50% of the
consumer price index.

The THI Senior Loan, with an outstanding
balance of approximately $50.0 million on December 27, 2002, was secured by 18 properties and bears interest at LIBOR plus 367 basis points, inclusive of upfront fees (with a LIBOR floor of three percent). On December 27, 2002, the Company sold the
THI Senior Loan to GE Capital Credit Corporation, generating net proceeds of $49.0 million, recognizing a minimal gain as a result of the sale.

The THI Mezzanine Loan, with a current principal balance of approximately $16.5 million, bears interest, inclusive of upfront fees, of 18% per annum and
is secured by equity pledges in THI and certain of its subsidiaries that own and operate the 18 facilities that also collateralize the THI Senior Loan, liens on four additional healthcare/senior housing properties, and interests in three additional
properties operated by THI. The Company funded the transaction by drawing on the Revolving Credit Facility under the 2002 Credit Agreement.

Note 7—Borrowing Arrangements

The following is a summary of the Company’s long-term debt and certain interest rate and maturity information as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 (in
thousands):

CMBS Transaction

On December 12, 2001, the Company raised $225.0 million
in gross proceeds from the completion of a commercial mortgage backed securitization transaction (the “CMBS Transaction”). Under a Loan and Security Agreement dated as of December 12, 2001 (the “CMBS Loan Agreement”), Ventas
Finance obtained a loan in the principal amount of $225.0 million (the “CMBS Loan”) from Merrill Lynch Mortgage Lending, Inc., as lender (the “CMBS Lender”). The CMBS Loan is comprised of six components (i) a component in the
original principal amount of $125,230,000 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.8665%; (ii) a component in the original principal amount of $17,970,000 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.1665%; (iii) a component in the original

F-15


Index to Financial Statements

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

principal amount of $8,860,000 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.5165%; (iv) a component in the original principal amount of $26,830,000 which bears
interest at LIBOR plus 1.9665%; (v) a component in the original principal amount of $26,830,000 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.6665%; and (vi) a component in the original principal amount of $19,280,000 which bears interest at LIBOR plus
3.1665%. Principal of and interest on the CMBS Loan is payable monthly. Principal payments on the CMBS Loan were calculated based upon a 25-year amortization schedule using an assumed interest rate of 9.46% per annum. The CMBS Loan matures on
December 9, 2006, at which time a principal balloon payment of approximately $206.3 million will be due, assuming all scheduled amortization payments are made and no prepayments are made on the CMBS Loan. The CMBS Loan may be prepaid in whole or in
part at any time and from time to time without penalty or premium.

On December 12, 2001, the Company used $212.8 million of the proceeds from the CMBS Loan to pay down a portion of the outstanding principal under the 2000 Credit Agreement. The Company recognized a $1.3 million loss on extinguishment of
debt relating to the partial write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs as a result of the aforementioned prepayments under the 2000 Credit Agreement.

The CMBS Loan is secured by liens on the 39 skilled nursing facilities (the “CMBS Properties”) transferred by Ventas Realty to Ventas Finance
and leased to Kindred under a Kindred Master Lease (the “Kindred CMBS Master Lease”). Except for certain customary exceptions, the CMBS Loan is non-recourse to Ventas Finance and the Company.

Ventas Finance is required to maintain or cause to be maintained the
following reserve accounts under the CMBS Loan Agreement: (a) a debt service reserve account in an amount of $5.0 million to cover shortfalls in cash available for debt service on the CMBS Loan, (b) an imposition and insurance reserve for the
payment of real property taxes and insurance premiums with respect to the CMBS Properties, and (c) a replacement reserve account in the amount of $1.58 million for the payment of the cost of capital improvements made to the CMBS Properties. The
impositions and insurance reserve and the replacement reserve under the CMBS Loan Agreement are being funded and/or maintained by Kindred as required under and in accordance with the terms of the Kindred CMBS Master Lease. If Kindred should be
unwilling or unable to fund these reserves under the CMBS Loan Agreement, Ventas Finance will be required to fund and/or maintain such reserves. Restricted cash at December 31, 2003 included $5.0 million related to the debt service reserve account
for the CMBS Loan.

Monthly rental amounts under the Kindred
CMBS Master Lease are deposited directly by Kindred into a central account for the benefit of the CMBS Lender. Amounts in the central account are applied to pay the monthly principal and interest payments on the CMBS Loan and to fund the reserve
accounts required under the CMBS Loan Agreement. Amounts remaining in the central account after the payment of the current month’s principal and interest payment and the funding of the reserve accounts are distributed to Ventas Finance,
provided no event of default has occurred and is continuing under the CMBS Loan Agreement and provided a Cash Flow Sweep Event (as defined below) has not occurred. The central account is swept on a daily basis.

During the continuance of an event of default or a Cash Flow Sweep Event, all
amounts in the central account in excess of the current month’s principal and interest payment and the required reserve payments will be deposited into an account and applied as a prepayment of the CMBS Loan on the next monthly payment date. A
“Cash Flow Sweep Event” occurs as of any date of determination if (the “Coverage Test”) (a) the ratio of (i) the aggregate net cash flow from the CMBS Properties for the applicable quarter to (ii) the debt service on the CMBS
Loan for the same quarter, is less than 1.50 to 1, or (b) the aggregate net cash flow from the CMBS Properties for the applicable quarter does not equal or exceed the rent payable under the Kindred CMBS Master Lease for the same quarter. No Cash
Flow Sweep Event will occur at any time while the Coverage Test is satisfied.

The 2002 Credit Agreement

On April 17, 2002 (the “2002 Refinancing Date”), the Company, as guarantor, and Ventas Realty, as borrower,
entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (the “2002 Credit Agreement”). Under the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty obtained a $350.0 million credit facility (the “Total Commitments”)
consisting of a $60.0 million term loan (the “Tranche B Term Loan”) and the $290.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. The 2002 Credit Agreement also permits Ventas Realty to obtain an additional term loan in an amount of not less than
$50.0 million, but not more than the remaining unused portion of the Total Commitments, subject to the conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement (the “Tranche C Term Loan”). Subject to the terms of, and the satisfaction of certain
conditions set forth in, the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty has the option to increase the Total Commitments (in the form of term and/or revolving loans) to an amount not to exceed $450.0 million.

The outstanding aggregate principal balance of the Tranche B Term Loan, the
Tranche C Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility may not collectively exceed either (a) the Borrowing Base (as described below) or (b) the Total Commitments. As of December 31, 2003, the outstanding principal balance of the Tranche B Term Loan
was $59.1 million and there was no outstanding principal balance under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2003, there was no Tranche C Term Loan.

Amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility may be borrowed and reborrowed from time to time, subject to the conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit
Agreement; provided, however, that the Revolving Credit Facility matures and must be repaid in full on April 17, 2005. The principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loan is payable in installments of $150,000 on the last day of each fiscal quarter,
beginning September 30, 2002, and matures and must be repaid in full on April 17, 2007.

Borrowings outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement bear interest at an Applicable Percentage over either (i) a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the higher of (a) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2002
Credit Agreement) in effect for the relevant period, plus one half of one percent (0.5%) and (b) the Prime Rate (as defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement) in effect for the relevant period (the “Base Rate”) or (ii) a fluctuating LIBOR-based
rate per annum (the “Eurodollar Rate”). With respect to Tranche B Term Loans, the Applicable Percentage is (a) 2.50% for loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate, and (b) 1.00% for loans bearing interest at the Base Rate (as defined
in the 2002 Credit Agreement). With respect to revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility:

(a)

If the senior unsecured (non-credit enhanced) long term debt of Ventas Realty or the Company is rated BBB- or better by Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) and Baa3 or
better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) (in the case of a split rating the lower rating will apply), the Applicable Percentage is as follows: (i) 0.25% for revolving loans bearing interest at the Base Rate and (ii)
2.25% for revolving loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate.

(b)

Otherwise, the Applicable Percentage is based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement) as follows:

on the last day of the applicable fiscal quarter, to EBITDA of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the period of four consecutive fiscal
quarters ending as of such day, as more particularly described in the 2002 Credit Agreement. The Applicable Percentage as of the period ended December 31, 2003 was based on pricing level I.

Loans outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement are pre-payable without
premium or penalty, provided that loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate are subject to customary “breakage” costs if repaid prior to the end of an interest period. Ventas Realty has agreed to pay various fees in connection with the
2002 Credit Agreement, including without limitation, issuance fees for letters of credit and fees for the unused portion of the total committed amount of the Revolving Credit Facility. Ventas Realty may permanently reduce or terminate the total
committed amount of the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement.

The Company (and any other owner of mortgaged property securing Ventas Realty’s obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement from time to time) has
guaranteed Ventas Realty’s obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement. Such obligations are secured by liens on certain of Ventas Realty’s real property assets and any related leases, rents and personal property, and, at Ventas
Realty’s option, may be secured by certain cash collateral from time to time. Currently, 54 real properties owned by Ventas Realty are mortgaged to secure the 2002 Credit Agreement (the “Borrowing Base Properties”). As of December 31,
2003, the carrying value of the 54 Borrowing Base Properties was $141.3 million. All 54 Borrowing Base Properties are leased to Kindred pursuant to Kindred Master Lease No. 1.

The Borrowing Base under the 2002 Credit Agreement is, as determined at any time, an amount equal to the sum of (i)
sixty-five percent (65%) of the aggregate appraised property value of the Borrowing Base Properties, plus (ii) one hundred percent (100%) of amounts on deposit in certain cash collateral or pledged accounts. The aggregate principal amount of the
obligations outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement (including the revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Tranche B Term Loan and the Tranche C Term Loan) may not at any time exceed the Borrowing Base. As of December 31, 2003,
the Borrowing Base was $320.9 million, and the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement was $59.1 million, and the remaining availability under the 2002 Credit Agreement was $261.8 million.
Ventas Realty may at any time include additional real estate assets (which must satisfy certain conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement) in the Borrowing Base to increase its remaining availability, up to the Total Commitments. Subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty may also obtain a release of various Borrowing Base Properties from the liens and security interests encumbering such properties.

The 2002 Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants,
including, without limitation, covenants pertaining to (i) the incurrence of additional indebtedness; (ii) limitations on liens; (iii) customary restrictions on certain dividends, distributions and other payments (the sum of all restricted payments
made by the Company after the 2002 Refinancing Date cannot exceed the sum of (a) 95% of the Company’s aggregate cumulative funds from operations (“FFO”) and (b) certain additional amounts further described in the 2002 Credit
Agreement); (iv) mergers, sales of assets and other transactions; (v) requirements regarding the maintenance of certain (a) consolidated leverage ratios, (b) consolidated fixed charge coverage ratios and (c) consolidated adjusted net worth;
(vi) transactions with affiliates; (vii) permitted business and development activities and uses of loan proceeds; and (viii) changes to material agreements. The 2002 Credit Agreement contains various potential events of default and is, among other
things, cross-defaulted with certain other indebtedness and obligations of Ventas Realty and the Company.

Senior Notes Offering

On the 2002 Refinancing Date, Ventas Realty and Ventas Capital Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ventas Realty
(collectively, the “Issuers”), completed the offering (the “Senior Notes Offering”) of 8


/


%
Senior Notes due 2009 in the aggregate principal amount of $175.0 million (the “2009 Senior Notes”) and 9% Senior Notes due 2012 in the aggregate principal amount of $225.0 million (the “2012 Senior Notes” and, together with the
2009 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”). The 2009 Senior Notes and the 2012 Senior Notes were issued under separate Indentures, each dated as of April 17, 2002 (collectively, the “Indentures”) and mature on May 1, 2009 and May 1,
2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, $174.2 million principal amount was outstanding under the 2009 Senior Notes and $191.8 million principal amount was outstanding under the 2012 Senior Notes.

The Senior Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis
by the Company and by certain of the Company’s current and future subsidiaries as described in the Indentures (collectively, the “Guarantors”). The Senior Notes are part of the general unsecured obligations of the Company and Ventas
Realty, rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior obligations of the Company and Ventas Realty, and rank senior to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company and Ventas Realty. However, the Senior Notes
are effectively subordinated to all borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement with respect to Borrowing Base Properties and any future assets securing indebtedness under the 2002 Credit Agreement. In addition, the Senior Notes are structurally
subordinated to approximately $215.4 million of indebtedness relating to the CMBS Transaction that is secured by the CMBS Properties. The Issuers may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption and a make-whole premium as described in the Indentures.

If the Company experiences certain kinds of changes of control, as described in the Indentures, the Issuers must make an offer to repurchase the Senior
Notes, in whole or in part, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase; provided, however, that in the event Moody’s and S&P have confirmed their
ratings of the Senior Notes and certain other conditions are met as set forth in the Indentures, this repurchase obligation will not apply.

The Indentures contain covenants that limit the ability of the Company and certain of the Company’s subsidiaries (collectively, the “Restricted
Group”) to, among other things (i) incur debt, (ii) incur secured debt, (iii) make certain dividend payments, distributions and investments (the sum of all restricted payments made by the Company after the 2002 Refinancing Date cannot exceed
the sum of (a) 95% of the Company’s aggregate cumulative FFO and (b) certain additional amounts further described in the Indentures), (iv) enter into certain transactions, including transactions with affiliates, (v) subject the Company’s
subsidiaries to restrictions on dividends or other payments to the Company, (vi) merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the Restricted Group’s assets and (vii) sell assets. These covenants are subject to certain exceptions
and qualifications as described in the Indentures. The Restricted Group is also required to maintain total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of the Restricted Group’s unsecured debt. If the Company obtains an investment grade rating, certain
of these covenants will be suspended while such rating remains in effect.

Pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the Senior Notes Offering, on July 25, 2002, the Issuers and Guarantors completed an offer to exchange the Senior Notes with a new series
of notes that are registered under the Securities Act and are otherwise substantially identical to the outstanding Senior Notes, except that certain transfer restrictions, registration rights and liquidated damages relating to the outstanding Senior
Notes do not apply to the new notes. The Company did not receive any additional proceeds in connection with the exchange offer.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

On December 31, 2002, the Company repurchased $34.0 million principal of Senior Notes with a portion
of the proceeds of the Equity Offering. The Company purchased $0.8 million principal of 2009 Senior Notes and $33.2 million principal of 2012 Senior Notes in open market purchases. The total purchase price aggregated $37.4 million and is reflected
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as securities settlement due. As a result of these purchases, the Company reported a loss on extinguishment of debt of $4.2 million in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002.

Scheduled Maturities of Borrowing Arrangements

As of December 31, 2003, the Company’s indebtedness has the following
maturities (in thousands):

Use of Proceeds;
Repayment of 2000 Credit Agreement

On April 17, 2002, the
Company used (i) the $400.0 million gross proceeds from the Senior Notes Offering, (ii) $220.3 million of borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement (consisting of $60.0 million of borrowings under the Tranche B Term Loan and $160.3 million of
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) and (iii) approximately $14.3 million cash on hand to: (a) repay all outstanding indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement, (b) pay certain closing costs, fees and expenses, and (c) pay a one-time
$13.6 million breakage cost relating to the termination of $350.0 million notional amount of the 1998 Swap (defined below). The $13.6 million breakage cost is composed of (i) a $12.8 million swap breakage fee and (ii) $0.8 million of accrued
interest on the terminated $350.0 million notional amount for the period April 1, 2002 through April 17, 2002. The Company recorded a $6.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt to write-off unamortized deferred financing costs relating to the 2000
Credit Agreement.

Derivatives and Hedging

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of
interest rate changes. The Company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used primarily to fix the rate on debt based on
floating-rate indices and to manage the cost of borrowing obligations. The Company currently has an interest rate swap to manage interest rate risk. The Company prohibits the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivative is
designed to hedge, the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.

One of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements expired on June 30, 2003 and had a notional principal amount as of
December 31, 2002 of $425.0 million (the “1998 Swap”). Under the 1998 Swap the Company paid a fixed rate at 5.985% and received LIBOR (floating rate).

On August 4, 1999, the Company entered into an agreement with the 1998 Swap counterparty to shorten the maturity of the 1998
Swap from December 31, 2007 to June 30, 2003 in exchange for a payment in 1999 from

F-20

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

the counterparty to the Company of $21.6 million. The Company began amortizing such amount for financial accounting purposes out of Accumulated Comprehensive
Income in July 2003 and will continue such amortization through December 2007, subject to the adjustments described below.

On the 2002 Refinancing Date, as a result of the consummation of the Senior Notes Offering and the establishment of the new credit facility under the 2002
Credit Agreement, all of the outstanding indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement was repaid in full. Consequently, the Company entered into an agreement with the 1998 Swap counterparty to break $350.0 million of the $800.0 million 1998 Swap
notional amount in exchange for a payment to the counterparty of approximately $12.8 million. Additionally, a portion of the previously deferred gain recorded in connection with the 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of the 1998 Swap also was
impacted. Based on the Company’s previous designation of the 1998 Swap to hedge the Company’s exposure to variable rate debt, the $12.8 million partial swap breakage cost and $7.4 million of the approximately $21.6 million deferred gain,
both of which were previously recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, were recognized as a net expense of $5.4 million in the Statement of Operations.

The 1998 Swap was treated as a cash flow hedge. Over time, the unrealized
gains and losses recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income were reclassified into earnings in the same periods in which the hedged interest payments affected earnings. The amount reclassified into interest
expense on the 1998 Swap for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 was $9.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2002, a portion of the unrealized loss on the 1998 Swap previously reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income had been
reclassified to operations to reflect the excess of the notional amount of the 1998 Swap and 2003-2008 Swap over the anticipated variable rate debt balances in the future. An expense of $1.9 million was recognized in the Statement of Operations to
reflect this anticipated overhedged position.

On September 28,
2001, the Company entered into a second interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of $450.0 million (the “2003-2008 Swap”) to hedge floating-rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008, under which the Company
pays a fixed rate at 5.385% and receives LIBOR from the counterparty to the agreement. The 2003-2008 Swap is treated as a cash flow hedge. On December 11, 2003, the Company received unanticipated cash proceeds from the sale of various facilities to
Kindred, thereby reducing its expected variable rate debt balances in the future. Accordingly, the Company entered into an agreement with the 2003-2008 Swap counterparty to break $120 million of the $450 million notional amount in exchange for a
payment to the counterparty of approximately $8.6 million. The $8.6 million represents the value of the $120 million notional for the period December 11, 2003 through June 30, 2006. In addition, a portion of the deferred gain from the 1998 Swap was
also impacted by the change in expectation. Based on the Company’s previous designation of the 1998 Swap and 2003-2008 Swap to hedge the Company’s exposure to variable rate debt, the $8.6 million breakage cost and $3.4 million of the
remaining $14.2 million deferred gain (both of which were previously recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accumulated Other Income), were recognized as a net expense of $5.2 million in the Statement of Operations. The amount reclassified
into interest expense on the 2003-2008 Swap for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 was $10.2 million. Assuming no changes in interest rates, the Company estimates that approximately $[13.0] million of the current balance recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income will be recognized as interest expense within the next twelve months consistent with historical reporting. There are no collateral requirements under the 2003-2008 Swap. The
notional amount of the 2003-2008 Swap is $330.0 million and is scheduled to decline as follows:

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of the non-performance by the counterparty to an
interest rate swap agreement. However, the Company does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparty to the 2003-2008 Swap.

In accordance with the terms of the CMBS Loan Agreement, on December 11, 2001, Ventas Finance purchased an interest rate cap from a highly rated
counterparty (the “Buy Cap”). Because the Company already hedged its consolidated interest rate risk through the 1998 Swap and 2003-2008 Swap, on December 11, 2001 the Company sold an interest rate cap (the “Sell Cap”) for the
same notional value ($225.0 million) and on the same terms (5 year amortizing 8% LIBOR cap) as the Buy Cap. If LIBOR should exceed the 8% cap, the Sell Cap would require the Company to pay the counterparty and the Buy Cap would require the
counterparty to pay Ventas Finance for the interest accruing in excess of the 8% LIBOR cap. The Buy Cap and the Sell Cap are shown separately as an asset and a liability on the Company’s balance sheet, respectively. The Company believes that
the economic substance of the Buy Cap offsets the net cash flow exposure of the Sell Cap.

At December 31, 2003, the 2003-2008 Swap was reported at its fair value of $27.9 million in liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The offsetting entry is reported as a deferred loss in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income. The Buy and Sell Caps are reported at their fair value of approximately $0.4 million in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The offsetting adjustments for the Buy Cap and the
Sell Cap are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and net to zero.

Note 8—Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments.

•

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents reported in the balance sheet approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.

•

Investment in Kindred Common Stock: The investment was liquidated in 2003. The fair value for 2002 is based on the quoted market value.

•

Real estate loan receivable: The fair value of the Company’s loan receivable approximates its net carrying value, based on rates offered for similar arrangements.

•

Notes receivable from employees: The fair values of the notes receivable from employees are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates being offered for
similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings.

•

Interest rate swap and cap agreements: The fair values of the Company’s interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements are based on rates being offered for similar
arrangements which consider forward yield curves and discount rates.

•

2002 Credit Agreement: The fair values of the Company’s borrowings under variable rate agreements approximate their carrying value.

•

Senior Notes payable: The fair values of the Company’s borrowings under fixed rate agreements are estimated based on open market trading activity provided by a third party.

•

United States Settlement: The obligation was paid in full during 2003. The fair value of the Company’s settlement with the United States for 2002 approximates its carrying
value.

•

Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities: The fair values of the Company’s borrowings under the CMBS Loan’s variable rate agreements approximate their carrying value.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002 the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company’s financial
instruments are as follows (in thousands):

Fair value estimates
are subjective in nature and are dependent on a number of important assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows, risks, discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument. The use of
different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in
a current market exchange.

Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity and Stock
Options

The Company has five plans under which options to
purchase common stock have been, or may be, granted to officers, employees and non-employee directors and one plan under which certain directors may receive common stock of the Company in lieu of director fees (the following are collectively
referred to as the “Plans”): (1) The 1987 Incentive Compensation Program (Employee Plan); (2) The 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan); (3) The 1987 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors; (4) The 2000 Stock Option Plan
for Directors; (5) The TheraTx, Incorporated 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan; and (6) The Common Stock Purchase Plan for Directors (the “Directors Stock Purchase Plan”). On May 23, 2000, the Company’s shareholders voted in favor
of the amendment and restatement of the 1997 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors as the 2000 Stock Option Plan for Directors and the amendment and restatement of the 1997 Incentive Compensation Plan as the 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan
(the “2000 Incentive Plan”). As part of the amendment and restatement of the 2000 Incentive Plan, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2000 Incentive Plan by 2.22 million
shares and increased the maximum number of shares with respect to which stock options can be granted during a calendar year to any given individual to 750,000 shares. On May 15, 2003, the Company’s shareholders voted in favor of Amendment No. 1
to the Company’s 2000 Stock Option Plan for Directors, which increased the number of shares reserved for issuance under the plan by 200,000.

Under the Plans (other than the Directors Stock Purchase Plan), options are exercisable at the market price at the date of grant, expire ten years from
the date of grant, and vest over varying periods ranging from one to four years. The Company has also granted options and restricted stock to certain officers, employees and non-employee directors outside of the Plans. The options and shares of
restricted stock that have been granted outside the Plans vest over varying periods and the options are exercisable at the market price at the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2003, options for 2,327,618
shares had been granted

to eligible participants and remained outstanding (including options granted prior to the 1998 Spin Off (as defined below) and held by Kindred employees)
under the provisions of the Plans. As of December 31, 2003, options for 238,000 shares had been granted outside of the Plans to certain employees and non-employee directors and remained outstanding. The Company granted 157,934, 200,634 and 308,250
shares of restricted stock for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The market value of the restricted shares on the date of the award has been recorded as unearned compensation on restricted stock, with the unamortized
balance shown as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Unearned compensation is amortized to expense over the vesting period, with charges to operations of approximately $1.3 million in 2003, $1.9 million in 2002 and $1.7 million in
2001.

The Company only utilizes the 2000 Incentive
Compensation Plan (Employee Plan), the 2000 Stock Option Plan for Directors and the Directors Stock Purchase Plan for option and stock grants and stock issuances. Under the terms of the Ventas, Inc. 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan),
5,620,000 shares are reserved for grants to be issued to employees. Under the terms of the Ventas, Inc. 2000 Stock Option Plan for Directors, 200,000 shares are reserved for grants or issuance to the chairman of the board and non-employee directors.
Under the terms of the Directors Stock Purchase Plan, 200,000 shares are reserved for issuance to the chairman of the board and non-employee directors in lieu of the payment of all or a portion of their retainer and meeting fees, at their option. As
of December 31, 2003, the number of shares available for future grants or issuance under the Ventas, Inc. 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan), the Ventas, Inc. 2000 Stock Option Plan for Directors, and the Directors Stock Purchase Plan
are 1,596,509, 253,000 and 169,335, respectively. No additional grants are permitted under the 1987 Incentive Compensation Program, the 1987 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the TheraTx, Incorporated 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance
Plan. As a result, the shares reserved under these three Plans equal the options outstanding under such Plans. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has reserved 1,005,342 shares for these Plans.

A summary of stock
options outstanding at December 31, 2003 follows:

In 1995, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS No. 123”). This standard prescribes a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options or similar equity instruments and requires certain pro
forma disclosures. For purposes of the pro forma disclosures required under SFAS No. 123, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the option’s vesting period. The estimated fair value of options granted for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was approximately $235,500, $337,100 and $633,300, respectively.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
No. 123 to all stock-based employee compensation (in thousands, except per share amounts):

In determining the estimated fair value of the Company’s stock options as of the date of grant,
a Black-Scholes option pricing model was used with the following assumptions:

The Black-Scholes
options valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions,
including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company’s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect
the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

Note 10—Income Taxes

The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the “Code”), commencing with the year that ended
December 31, 1999. The Company intends to continue to operate in such a manner as to enable it to qualify as a REIT. The Company’s actual qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon its ability to meet, on a continuing basis, distribution
levels, stock ownership, and the various qualification tests imposed under the Code.

No net provision for income taxes has been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2003 due to the Company’s belief that it qualified as a REIT and the distribution of
more than 100% of its 2003 taxable income as a dividend. As a result of the uncertainties relating to the Company’s ability to retain its operating loss carryforwards, the Company recorded a provision for taxes on the 10% of its estimated 2001
taxable income which the Company did not distribute as a dividend. The 5.0% effective tax rate for 2001 was determined based on the 35% federal statutory rate plus an incremental state rate less the dividends paid deduction. In the third quarter of
2002, the Company filed its 2001 federal tax return on which it elected to apply certain 2002 dividend payments in excess of its 2002 taxable net income. As a result, the Company recorded a $2.2 million tax benefit for 2002.

The 2002 and 2001 provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the
following including the provision on discontinued operations (in thousands):

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Although the Company believes that it satisfied the requirements to qualify as a REIT for the years
ended December 31, 1999 through 2003 and although the Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT in subsequent years, it is possible that economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause the Company to fail, or elect not to,
continue to qualify as a REIT in any such tax year.

The
Company believes it has met the annual distribution requirement by payment of at least 90% of its estimated taxable income for 2003, 2002 and 2001. The Company’s dividends for the tax years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 constitute
ordinary income to the Company’s stockholders for tax purposes.

Net taxable income for federal income tax purposes results from net income for financial reporting purposes adjusted for the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, including depreciation,
prepaid rent, impairment losses on real estate, the United States Settlement liability, and the interest rate swap agreement. The net difference between tax bases of the Company’s asset and liabilities for federal income tax purposes was $119.2
and $160.0 million more than the book bases of those assets and liabilities for financial reporting for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company made no income tax payments for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

As a former C corporation for federal income tax purposes, the Company
potentially remains subject to corporate level taxes for any asset dispositions for the period January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2008 (“Built-in Gains Tax”). The amount of income potentially subject to this special corporate level tax
is generally equal to (a) the excess of the fair value of the asset as of December 31, 1998 over its adjusted tax basis as of December 31, 1998, or (b) the actual amount of gain, whichever of (a) and (b) is lower. Some but not all gains recognized
during this period of time could be offset by available net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards. The deferred income tax liability of $30.4 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, reflects a previously established liability to be utilized
for any Built-in Gains Tax incurred on assets that are disposed of prior to January 1, 2009.

Prior to and during the Kindred bankruptcy, the Company and Kindred were engaged in disputes regarding the entitlement to federal, state and local tax refunds for the tax periods prior to and including May 1, 1998
(“Subject Periods”) which had been received or which would be received by either company. A tax allocation agreement dated April 30, 1998, between Kindred and the Company (“Tax Allocation Agreement”), provides that the Company
and Kindred will be liable for, and will hold each other harmless from and against, respectively, certain tax liabilities for Subject Periods.

On the Kindred Effective Date, Kindred and the Company entered into the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement governing their relative entitlement to certain tax
refunds for the Subject Periods that each received or may receive in the future. The Tax Refund Escrow Agreement amends and supplements the Tax Allocation Agreement. Under the terms of the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement, refunds (“Subject
Refunds”) received on or after September 13, 1999 by either Kindred or the Company with respect to federal, state or local income, gross receipts, windfall profits, transfer, duty, value-added, property, franchise, license, excise, sales and
use, capital, employment, withholding, payroll, occupational or similar business taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to tax, but excluding certain refunds), for taxable periods ending on or prior to May 1, 1998, or including May 1,
1998 and received on or after September 13, 1999 (“Subject Taxes”) must be deposited into an escrow account with a third-party escrow agent on the Kindred Effective Date.

The Tax Refund Escrow Agreement provides generally that Kindred and the Company waive their rights under the Tax Allocation
Agreement to make claims against each other with respect to Subject Taxes satisfied by the funds in the escrow account (the “Escrow Funds”), notwithstanding the indemnification provisions of the Tax

F-27

VENTAS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Allocation Agreement. To the extent that the Escrow Funds are insufficient to satisfy all liabilities for Subject Taxes that are finally determined to be due
(such excess amount, “Excess Taxes”), the relative liability of Kindred and the Company to pay such Excess Taxes shall be determined as provided in the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement. Disputes under the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement, and the
determination of the relative liability of Kindred and the Company to pay Excess Taxes, if any, are governed by the arbitration provision of the Tax Allocation Agreement.

Interest earned on the Escrow Funds or included in refund amounts received from governmental authorities is distributed
equally to each of Kindred and the Company on an annual basis and are accrued as interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Any Escrow Funds remaining in the escrow account after no further claims may be made by governmental
authorities with respect to Subject Taxes or Subject Refunds (because of the expiration of statutes of limitation or otherwise) will be distributed equally to Kindred and the Company. At December 31, 2003, approximately $0.7 million of disputed
Subject Refunds and accrued interest, representing 50% of the Escrow Funds, is recognized in restricted cash and other liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

On April 1, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) notified the Company that it had completed its review of
the Company’s federal income tax returns for the Company’s 1997 and 1998 tax periods. The Joint Committee on Taxation affirmed the IRS Revenue Agent’s report concluding that the Company (1) does not owe any additional taxes for those
periods, (2) is entitled to retain the approximately $26 million federal tax refund it received in 2000 for those periods (the “Original Federal Refund Amount”), and (3) is entitled to receive an additional refund of $1.2 million for those
periods (the “Additional Federal Refund Amount”). In addition, as a result of the completion of the audit, the Company will retain substantially all of its favorable tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss
carryforwards.

In September 2003, the Company received the
Additional Federal Refund Amount which was deposited in the Tax Refund Escrow. Certain other refunds for tax periods ending on or before 1998 are expected to be deposited in the Tax Refund Escrow when received. The Company has recorded its portion
of these expected refunds as a receivable in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003.

Under the terms of the agreement governing the Tax Refund Escrow, when no further claims may be made for tax periods ending on or before 1998, all funds
remaining in the Tax Refund Escrow will be distributed equally to the Company and Kindred. In addition, the companies may jointly agree to disburse funds from the Tax Refund Escrow in equal amounts prior to the expiration of applicable statutes of
limitations. Any additional disbursements from the Tax Refund Escrow will be made as remaining tax claims are resolved.

As a result of the Joint Committee on Taxation’s findings, on April 3, 2003, the Company and Kindred agreed to disburse $13.5 million to each company
from a previously established escrow account (the “Tax Refund Escrow”). The Tax Refund Escrow held the Original Federal Refund Amount and certain other tax refunds (collectively, the “Tax Refund Escrow Funds”) related to periods
ending in years prior to or including the date of the 1998 Spin Off. As a result of the additional Federal Refund Amount and other state and local refunds, in October 2003 the Company and Kindred agreed to disburse $1.0 million to each company from
the Tax Refund Escrow. After payment of certain related expenses, the Company used approximately $14.0 million of its portion of the Tax Refund Escrow Funds to repay debt. As of December 31, 2003, the Company’s share of the amounts currently
held in the Tax Refund Escrow was approximately $0.7 million.

In 2003, the Company reported an increase of approximately $20.2 million to its operating results, reflecting the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability. A portion of this contingent liability included the Company’s
share of the Tax Refund Escrow Funds reported in Other Liabilities—disputed Federal, State and Local Tax Refunds on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The other portion of this contingent liability

was previously recorded in Accounts Payable and Other Accrued Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet to take into account the uncertainties
surrounding the outcome of the IRS audit for the Company’s 1997 and 1998 tax periods as well as other federal, state, local, franchise and miscellaneous tax items. As of December 31, 2003, the total contingent liability was $1.2 million. As of
December 31, 2002, the Company had recorded a tax contingency liability of $21.3 million. Included in general administrative expenses on the Company’s Statement of Operations is a tax contingency expense of $1.5 million for 2001.

The Company’s 1998 federal income tax return reflected capital loss
carryforwards of approximately $200.1 million of which $0.6 million was carried back to 1996. The Company utilized $65.2 million, $26.1 million and $16.4 million of capital loss carryforwards for the tax years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The remaining $91.8 million expired as of December 31, 2003. After fully utilizing NOL carrybacks, the Company also had an NOL carryforward of $7.6 million at December 31, 2003. These amounts can be used to offset future taxable income
(and/or taxable income for prior years if audits of any prior year’s return determine that amounts are owed), if any, remaining after the dividends paid deduction. The Company will be entitled to utilize NOLs and tax credit carryforwards only
to the extent that REIT taxable income exceeds the Company’s deduction for dividends paid. The NOL carryforwards expire in 2018. The availability of the carryforwards are subject to the results of the ongoing IRS examination for the prior tax
years.

As a result of the uncertainties relating to the
ultimate utilization of favorable tax attributes described above, no net deferred tax benefit has been ascribed to capital loss and net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. The IRS may challenge the Company’s
entitlement to these tax attributes during its review of the Company’s tax returns for the previous tax years. The Company believes it is entitled to these tax attributes, but there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters.

As in certain prior periods, the IRS is currently reviewing
the federal income tax return of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies

Agreement of Indemnity—Third Party Leases

In connection with the Company’s spin off of Kindred in 1998 (the “1998 Spin Off”), the Company assigned its former third party lease obligations (i.e., leases under which an unrelated third party is the landlord) as a tenant
or as a guarantor of tenant obligations to Kindred (the “Third Party Leases”). Under the terms of an indemnity agreement relating to the Third Party Leases, Kindred and its subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify and hold the Company
harmless from and against all claims against the Company arising out of the Third Party Leases assigned by the Company to Kindred. Either prior to or following the 1998 Spin Off, the tenant’s rights under a subset of the Third Party Leases were
assigned or sublet to third parties unrelated to Kindred. If Kindred or such third party subtenants are unable to or do not satisfy the obligations under any Third Party Lease, the lessors may claim that the Company remains liable under the Third
Party Leases. The Company believes it may have valid legal defenses to any such claim. However, there can be no assurance the Company would prevail against a claim brought by a lessor under a Third Party Lease. In the event that a lessor should
prevail in a claim against the Company, the Company may be entitled to receive revenues from those properties that would mitigate the costs incurred in connection with the satisfaction of such obligations. The Third Party Leases relating to nursing
facilities, hospitals, offices and warehouses have remaining terms (excluding renewal periods) of one to ten years. The Third Party Leases relating to ground leases have remaining terms from one to 80 years. Under the Final Plan, Kindred assumed and
agreed to fulfill its obligations under the indemnity agreement relating to the Third Party Leases. There can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy, or that it will continue
to honor, its obligations under the indemnity

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

agreement relating to the Third Party Leases. Under the Final Plan, Kindred has agreed not to renew or extend any Third Party Lease unless it first obtains a
release of the Company from liability under such Third Party Lease.

The total aggregate remaining minimum rental payments under the Third Party Leases are as follows (in thousands):

Agreement of
Indemnity—Third Party Contracts

In connection with
the 1998 Spin Off, the Company assigned its former third party guaranty agreements to Kindred (the “Third Party Guarantees”). Under the terms of an indemnity agreement relating to the Third Party Guarantees, Kindred and its subsidiaries
have agreed to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and against all claims against the Company arising out of the Third Party Guarantees. Under the Final Plan, Kindred assumed and agreed to fulfill its obligations under the indemnity
agreement relating to the Third Party Guarantees. There can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy, or that it will continue to honor, its obligations incurred in connection
with the indemnity agreement relating to the Third Party Guarantees. If Kindred is unable to or does not satisfy the obligations under any Third Party Guarantee, then the Company may be liable for the payment and performance of the obligations under
any such agreement. However, the Company believes it may have valid legal defenses to any such claim under a Third Party Guarantee. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has a $5.0 million potential obligation that is subject to the Third Party
Guarantees.

Assumption of Certain Operating Liabilities and
Litigation

In connection with the 1998 Spin Off, Kindred
agreed in various agreements (the “Spin Agreements”) to, among other things, assume and to indemnify the Company for any and all liabilities that may arise out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations either before or
after the date of the 1998 Spin Off. The indemnification provided by Kindred also covers losses, including costs and expenses, which may arise from any future claims asserted against the Company based on these healthcare operations. In addition, at
the time of the 1998 Spin Off, Kindred agreed to assume the defense, on behalf of the Company, of any claims that were pending at the time of the 1998 Spin Off, and which arose out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations. Kindred
also agreed to defend, on behalf of the Company, any claims asserted after the 1998 Spin Off which arise out of the ownership and operation of the healthcare operations. Under the Final Plan, Kindred assumed and agreed to perform its obligations
under these indemnifications. There can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy, or that Kindred will continue to honor, its obligations incurred in connection with the 1998
Spin Off. If Kindred does not satisfy or otherwise honor the obligations under these arrangements, then the Company may be liable for the payment and performance of such obligations and may have to assume the defense of such claims.

Kindred Common Stock

On the Kindred Effective Date, Ventas Realty received 1,498,500 shares of the common stock in Kindred Common Stock,
representing not more than 9.99% of the issued and outstanding common stock in Kindred as of the Kindred Effective Date. Based on applicable laws, regulations, advice from experts, an appraisal, the trading performance of Kindred common stock at the
time and other appropriate facts and circumstances, the illiquidity and lack of registration of the Kindred Common Stock when received and the Company’s lack of significant influence over Kindred, the Company determined the value of the Kindred
Common Stock was $18.2 million on the date received by Ventas Realty. The Kindred Common Stock was issued to the Company as additional future rent in consideration of the Company’s agreement to charge the base rent as provided in the Kindred
Master Leases.

The Company disposed of 418,186 shares of
Kindred Common Stock in the fourth quarter of 2001 and recognized a gain of $15.4 million on the dispositions. In connection with a registered offering of common stock by Kindred, Ventas Realty sold 83,300 shares of Kindred Common Stock, recognizing
a gain of $2.6 million. The Company distributed 334,886 shares of Kindred Common Stock as part of the 2001 dividend, resulting in a gain of $12.8 million. For purposes of the 2001 dividend, the Kindred Common Stock was valued in accordance with the
Code and applicable rulings and regulations on December 31, 2001 at $51.02 per share (the average of the high and low price on that day).

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company disposed of a total of 159,500 shares of Kindred Common Stock and recognized a gain of $5.0 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company disposed
of the remaining 920,814 shares of Kindred Common Stock and recognized a gain of $9.0 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the sales of the Kindred Common Stock to prepay the Company’s outstanding indebtedness and for general
corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2003, the Company did not own any Kindred Common Stock.

Settlement of United States Claims

Kindred and the Company were the subject of investigations by the United States Department of Justice regarding the Company’s prior healthcare operations, including matters arising from lawsuits filed under the
qui tam, or whistleblower, provision of the Federal Civil False Claims Act, which allows private citizens to bring a suit in the name of the United States. See “Note 13—Litigation.” The Kindred Reorganization Plan contains a
comprehensive settlement of all of these claims by the United States Department of Justice (the “United States Settlement”).

Under the United States Settlement, the Company was required to pay $103.6 million to the United States, of which $34.0 million was paid on the Kindred
Effective Date. The balance of $69.6 million bore interest at 6% per annum and was payable in equal quarterly installments over a five-year term commencing on June 30, 2001 and ending in 2006. The Company also paid approximately $0.4 million to
legal counsel for the relators in the qui tam actions. In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded the full amount of the obligation under the United States Settlement for $96.5 million based on an imputed interest rate of 10.75%. On June
30, 2003 the Company incurred a $2.7 million expense relating to the early repayment of the United States Settlement that is reflected as the United States Settlement interest expense on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income for the
year ended December 31, 2003. The $2.7 million interest expense reflects the difference between the total amount paid by the Company in final repayment of the United States Settlement and the amount reflected on the Company’s balance sheet on
the date of final repayment. There was no prepayment penalty or other charges on account of such early prepayment.

Options to purchase
1,065,589 shares of common stock ranging from $15.69 to $24.47 were outstanding at December 31, 2003, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market
price of the common shares for the year ended December 31, 2003 and therefore, the effect would be anti-dilutive. Options to purchase 2.8 million shares of common stock ranging from $13.13 to $26.0476, were outstanding at December 31, 2002 but were
not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares for the year ended December 31, 2002 and, therefore, the effect would be
anti-dilutive. Options to purchase 3.1 million shares of common stock ranging from $10.8125 to $26.0476 were outstanding at December 31, 2001, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise
price was greater than the average market price of the common shares for the year ended December 31, 2001 and, therefore, the effect would be anti-dilutive.

the Spin Agreements, Kindred agreed to assume the defense, on behalf of the Company, of any claims that (a) were pending at the time of the 1998 Spin Off and
which arose out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets or liabilities transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off, or (b) were asserted after the 1998 Spin Off and which arose out of the
ownership and operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets or liabilities transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off, and to indemnify the Company for any fees, costs, expenses and liabilities arising out of such
operations (the “Indemnification”). Kindred is presently defending the Company in the matters described below, among others. Under the Final Plan, Kindred assumed and agreed to abide by the Indemnification and to defend the Company in
these and other matters as required under the Spin Agreements. However, there can be no assurance that Kindred will continue to defend the Company in such matters or that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable
it to satisfy such obligations or its obligations incurred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off. In addition, many of the following descriptions are based primarily on information included in Kindred’s public filings and information provided to
the Company by Kindred. There can be no assurance that Kindred has included in its public filings and provided the Company complete and accurate information in all instances.

A stockholder derivative suit entitled

Thomas G. White on behalf of Kindred, Inc. and Ventas, Inc. v. W. Bruce Lunsford,
et al

., Case No. 98 C103669 was filed in June 1998 in the Jefferson County, Kentucky, Circuit Court. The Complaint alleges, among other things, that certain former officers and directors damaged Kindred and the Company by engaging in violations
of the securities laws, including engaging in insider trading, fraud and securities fraud and damaging the reputation of Kindred and the Company. The suit seeks unspecified damages, interest, punitive damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert
witness fees and other costs, and any extraordinary equitable and/or injunctive relief permitted by law or equity to assure the plaintiff has an effective remedy. The Company believes the allegations in the Complaint are without merit. On October 4,
2002, Kindred filed with the Court a motion to dismiss this action as to all defendants, including the Company, for lack of prosecution by the plaintiffs. On October 14, 2002, the Court granted Kindred’s motion to dismiss with prejudice. On
October 17, 2002, the plaintiffs filed with the Court a motion to vacate that order of dismissal in order to allow further briefing. In response to the plaintiffs October 17, 2002 motion to vacate the order of dismissal, on August 13, 2003, the
Court issued an order vacating the order dismissing the suit. On September 17, 2003, Kindred filed a renewed motion to dismiss this action as to all defendants, including the Company. Plaintiffs have not yet responded to this motion. Kindred
has indicated that it intends to continue to defend this action vigorously on behalf of the Company.

A class action lawsuit entitled

Sally Pratt, et al. v. Ventas, Inc. et al.

was filed on May 25, 2001 in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Kentucky (Civil Action No. 3-01CV-317-H). The putative class action complaint alleges that the Company and certain current and former officers and employees of the Company engaged in a fraudulent scheme to conceal the true nature
and substance of the 1998 Spin Off resulting in (a) a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, (b) bankruptcy fraud, (c) common law fraud, and (d) a deprivation of plaintiffs’ civil rights. The plaintiffs allege that
the defendants failed to act affirmatively to explain and disclose the fact that the Company was the entity that had been known as Vencor, Inc. prior to the 1998 Spin Off and that a new separate and distinct legal entity assumed the name of Vencor,
Inc. after the 1998 Spin Off. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants filed misleading documents in the plaintiffs’ state court lawsuits that were pending at the time of the 1998 Spin Off and that the defendants deceptively used the Delaware
bankruptcy proceedings of Vencor, Inc. (now Kindred) to stay lawsuits against the Company. As a result of these actions, the plaintiffs maintain that they and similarly situated individuals suffered and will continue to suffer severe financial harm.
The suit seeks compensatory damages (trebled with interest), actual and punitive damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses, declaratory and injunctive and any and all other relief to which the plaintiffs may be entitled. Before
any class of plaintiffs was certified, this action was dismissed in its entirety on February 4, 2002 because it was deemed to be an impermissible collateral attack

on the Delaware Bankruptcy Court’s confirmation order. The plaintiffs thereafter filed an appeal of the District Court’s dismissal to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. However, on plaintiffs’ motion, the appeal was stayed after the plaintiffs separately filed a motion with the Delaware Bankruptcy Court seeking, among other things, to have the Delaware Bankruptcy
Court set aside portions of the releases of the Company contained in the Final Plan, as such releases might apply to the plaintiffs. On September 19, 2002, the Delaware Bankruptcy Court denied the plaintiffs’ motion. On February 28, 2003, the
plaintiffs resumed their Sixth Circuit appeal by filing their initial brief with the Sixth Circuit. On April 1, 2003, Kindred, on behalf of the Company, filed defendants’ response brief. There were no material developments in this lawsuit
during the six months ended December 31, 2003. On January 21, 2004, the Company received notice that the Sixth Circuit has scheduled oral argument in the case for March 18, 2004. Kindred has indicated that it intends to continue to defend this
action vigorously on behalf of the Company.

Kindred is a party
to certain legal actions and regulatory investigations arising in the normal course of its business. The Company is a party to certain legal actions and regulatory investigations that arise from the normal course of its prior healthcare operations,
which legal actions and regulatory investigations are being defended by Kindred under the Indemnification. Neither the Company nor Kindred is able to predict the ultimate outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations. In addition,
there can be no assurance that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or other regulatory agencies will not initiate additional investigations related to Kindred’s business or the Company’s prior healthcare business in the future,
nor can there be any assurance that the resolution of any litigation or investigations, either individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on Kindred’s liquidity, financial position or results of operations, which
in turn could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Other Litigation

The Company is a plaintiff
in an action seeking a declaratory judgment and damages entitled

Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership et al. v. Black Diamond CLO 1998-1 Ltd., et al.,

Case No. 99C107076, filed November 22, 1999 in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County,
Kentucky. Two of the three defendants in that action, Black Diamond International Funding, Ltd. and BDC Finance, LLC (collectively “Black Diamond”), have asserted counterclaims against the Company under theories of breach of contract,
tortious interference with contract and abuse of process. The Company disputes the material allegations contained in Black Diamond’s counterclaims and the Company intends to continue to pursue its claims and defend the counterclaims vigorously.
There were no material developments in this action during the year ended December 31, 2003.

The Company is party to various lawsuits arising in the normal course of the Company’s business. It is the opinion of management that, except as set forth in this Note 13, the disposition of these lawsuits will
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. If management’s assessment of the Company’s liability with respect to these actions is incorrect, such lawsuits could have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

No provision for liability, if any, resulting
from the aforementioned litigation has been made in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2003.

Note 14—Capital Stock

The authorized capital stock of the Company at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 consisted of 180,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value of $.25 per
share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock of which 300,000 shares have been designated Series A Participating Preferred Stock.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

On June 19, 2002, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the
Commission relating to $750 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares and warrants. The registration statement became effective on July 8, 2002. As of December 31, 2003, $651 million of these securities remained
available for offering off the shelf registration statement.

During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002, the Company commenced and completed an equity offering of the Company’s common stock with Tenet Healthcare Corporation (“Tenet”). The Equity Offering consisted of 9,000,000
newly issued shares of common stock sold by Ventas and 8,301,067 shares of Ventas common stock owned and sold by Tenet, all priced at $11.00 per share. The net proceeds received by Ventas from its sale of its newly issued common stock were $93.6
million and were used to repay outstanding indebtedness including the indebtedness incurred by the Company to invest in the THI Transaction.

Excess Share Provision

In order to preserve the Company’s ability to maintain REIT status, the Company’s certificate of incorporation provides that if a person
acquires beneficial ownership of greater than 9% of the outstanding stock of the Company, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of such 9% limit are deemed to be “Excess Shares.” Excess Shares are automatically deemed
transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. The trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the Excess Shares and the trustee may
exercise all voting power over the Excess Shares.

The Company
has the right to buy the Excess Shares for a purchase price equal to the lesser of (1) the price per share in the transaction that created the Excess Shares, or (2) the market price on the date the Company buys the shares. The Company has the right
to defer payment of the purchase price for the Excess Shares for up to five years. If the Company does not purchase the Excess Shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the Excess Shares at the direction of the Board of Directors. The
owner of the Excess Shares is entitled to receive the lesser of the proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares or the original purchase price for such Excess Shares; any additional amounts are payable to the beneficiary of the trust.

The Company’s Board of Directors is empowered to grant waivers from the
“Excess Share” provisions of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation. On June 24, 2003 the Company granted a waiver (the “C&S Waiver”) from the 9% ownership limitation provisions of Article XII of the Company’s
Certificate of Incorporation to Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. (“C&S”). Under the C&S Waiver, C&S may beneficially own, in the aggregate, up to 14.0% in number of shares or value, of the Company’s common
stock.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

The Company’s Distribution Reinvestment and Stock
Purchase Plan (the “Plan”) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 31, 2001. Under the Plan’s terms, existing stockholders may purchase shares of common stock in the Company by reinvesting all or a
portion of the cash distribution on their shares of the Company’s common stock. In addition, existing stockholders of the Company, as well as new investors, may purchase shares of common stock in the Company by making optional cash payments.
Beginning with its 2004 first quarter dividend, the Company intends to offer a two percent discount on the purchase price of its stock to shareholders who reinvest their dividends and/or make optional cash purchases of the Company’s common
stock through the Plan. The availability of a market discount is at the Company’s discretion, as determined from time to time. The granting of a discount for one month or quarter, as applicable, will not insure the availability of a discount or
the same discount in future months or quarters, respectively. Each month or quarter, as applicable, the Company may lower or eliminate the discount without prior notice. The Company may also, without prior notice, change our determination as to
whether common shares will be purchased by the Plan Administrator directly from the Company or in the open market.

Note 15—Related Party Transactions

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had receivables of approximately $3.8 million and $4.1 million,
respectively, due from certain current and former executive officers of the Company. The loans include interest provisions (with a 5.0% average rate) and were to finance the income taxes payable by the executive officers resulting from: (i) the 1998
Spin Off and (ii) vesting of Restricted Shares. The loans are payable over periods ranging from four years to ten years with the majority of the obligations amortizing quarterly. Interest on a note relating to the 1998 Spin Off in the principal
amount of $1.9 million at December 31, 2003 (the “1998 Spin Off Note”), is paid on a quarterly basis. The payee of the 1998 Spin Off Note resigned as an employee and director of the Company on January 30, 2003. In the event of a change in
control as defined in the Company’s 1997 Incentive Compensation Plan, accrued interest on and the principal balance of the 1998 Spin Off Note is forgiven. Interest on the note relating to taxes paid for the vested portion of Restricted Shares
(the “Restricted Share Note”) is payable annually out of and only to the extent of dividends from the vested restricted shares. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the relevant employment agreement) or upon
termination of the officer without cause (as defined in the relevant employment agreement), the principal balance of the Restricted Share Note is forgiven. The Restricted Share Note is secured by a pledge of all of the restricted shares to which the
Restricted Share Note relates and the Restricted Share Note is otherwise non-recourse. The 1998 Spin Off Note is not secured.

On October 15, 1998, the Company acquired eight personal care facilities and related facilities for approximately $7.1 million from Tangram Rehabilitation
Network, Inc. (“Tangram”). Tangram is a wholly owned subsidiary of ResCare, Inc. (“ResCare”) of which a director of the Company is the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. The Company leases the Tangram facilities to
Tangram pursuant to a master lease agreement which is guaranteed by ResCare. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, Tangram has paid the Company approximately $816,000, $799,000 and $779,000, respectively, in rent payments.

Note 17—Condensed Consolidating Information

The Company and certain of its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries
(the “Subsidiary Guarantors”) have fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, the obligation to pay principal and interest with respect to the Senior Notes of Ventas Realty and Ventas Capital Corporation
(“Ventas Capital,” and together with Ventas Realty, the “Issuers”). The Company has other subsidiaries (“Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries”) that are not included among the Subsidiary Guarantors, and such subsidiaries are not
obligated with respect to the Senior Notes. Contractual and legal restrictions, including those contained in the agreements governing the CMBS Transaction, may under certain circumstances restrict the Company’s ability to obtain cash from its
Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting its debt service obligations, including the Company’s guarantee of payment of principal and interest on the Senior Notes. Additionally, as of December 31, 2003, approximately $141.3 million
of the net assets of Ventas Realty were mortgaged to secure the 2002 Credit Agreement. The following summarizes the condensed consolidating information for the Company as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and for each of the three years in the period
