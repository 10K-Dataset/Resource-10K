ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

General

We are a
diversified, global chemical company providing innovative solutions, applications and market-leading products to a wide variety of end markets. We operate in three distinct business segments: Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial
Chemicals. Agricultural Products’ principal focus is on insecticides, which are used to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a wide spectrum of pests, and on herbicides, which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical
weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth. Specialty Chemicals consists of our biopolymers and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture, structure and physical stability, pharmaceutical additives for
binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis and energy storage. Our Industrial Chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials, including soda ash, hydrogen peroxide, specialty peroxygens and
phosphorus chemicals.

The following table shows
the principal products produced by our three business segments and their raw materials and uses:


We have
operations in many areas around the world. North America represents our single largest geographic market, generating approximately 48 percent of revenue in 2002, with our second largest market, Europe, the Middle East and Africa representing 25
percent and Latin America, our third largest, representing 15 percent of 2002 revenue. With a worldwide manufacturing and distribution infrastructure, we are able to respond rapidly to global customer needs, offset downward economic trends in one
region with positive trends in another and better match revenues to local costs in order to mitigate the impact of currency volatility. The charts below detail our sales and long-term assets by major geographic region.

Effective December 31, 2001, we completed our plan to split into two companies. FMC has retained the three chemical segments. A separate company, FMC Technologies, Inc. (“Technologies”), operates the businesses that
comprised the former Energy Systems and Food and Transportation Systems segments. Our plan of separation was first announced on October 31, 2000. On May 31, 2001, we contributed the two non-chemical business segments to Technologies, which at the
time was a wholly-owned subsidiary of FMC. We completed an initial public offering of approximately 17 percent of Technologies’ stock in June 2001 and completed the separation on December 31, 2001 by distributing all remaining shares of
Technologies owned by FMC as a tax-free dividend to stockholders.

Our Strategy

Our
strategy is balanced between driving growth and innovation within our Specialty Chemicals and Agricultural Products segments and maintaining market shares through low-cost positions in our Industrial Chemicals segment. Our financial focus is on
maximizing cash flow and reducing debt, principally through continuing to reduce our costs and prudently managing capital expenditures and working capital.

We have a strategic objective toward concentrating our focus on areas with the greatest growth potential. In that regard, we are exploring
opportunities for divestitures and acquisitions.

Develop new technologies and products.

We have refocused our Agricultural Products segment on the development and marketing of new insecticides and new applications for our existing products, including
expanding the range of approved applications for our proprietary insecticides and herbicides (also known as “label expansions”). We are also developing strategic alliances in Agricultural Products to accelerate market penetration in
certain geographic regions and to access and develop new technologies. In this regard, we have obtained exclusive rights from Ishihara Songyo Kaisha, Ltd. (“ISK”) a leading Japanese crop protection company to develop and market
industry-leading research that applies knowledge of gene functions to identify biological targets and to distribute new insecticides. Additionally, we are accelerating discovery of new insecticides through


our so-called “genomics-based” research and related screening program. In our Specialty Chemicals segment, we continue to enhance
our product portfolio and grow market share through strategic alliances with large pharmaceutical and food customers to develop innovative drugs and new food products. We have shifted our lithium product mix from commodity lithium applications to
higher margin end-uses, such as pharmaceuticals and lithium ion battery products.

Manage Industrial Chemicals for cash.

We intend to maintain our market positions and low-cost structure by continually developing improved mining and manufacturing
processes and prudently managing our asset base. For example, in soda ash, we continually strive to optimize our proprietary and low-cost solution mining and longwall mining techniques, thereby reducing our production costs which we believe are
already among the lowest in the industry. Our phosphorus chemicals joint venture with Solutia, Inc. (“Solutia”), Astaris LLC (“Astaris”), recently shifted from an elemental phosphorus manufacturing process to a lower cost process
based on purified phosphoric acid (“PPA”). Also, we are focusing our marketing and technical resources within high-value niche applications in the food processing, environmental and electronics markets.

Continue to reduce costs.

We
aggressively seek ways to continue to reduce costs in each of our business segments. We have achieved our 2002 goal of reducing our cost structure and will continue to review all of our businesses for additional cost saving opportunities.

Reduce debt and re-establish an
investment-grade rating.

We are committed to the goal of re-establishing our investment-grade rating through debt reduction and the execution of our business strategies.

Financial Information About Our Business Segments

See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included
in this Form 10-K. Also see below for selected financial information related to our segments.

Agricultural Products

Financial Information (In Millions)

Overview

Our Agricultural Products segment,
which represents approximately 33 percent of our consolidated revenues, manufactures and sells a portfolio of crop protection, structural pest control, and turf and ornamental products around the globe. Our product development efforts focus on
developing more environmentally compatible solutions that can cost-effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide more cost-effective alternatives to older chemistries to which insects may have developed resistance. We believe that our
genomics-based discovery strategy will identify novel new insecticides that enable farmers to enhance their crop yields.


Products and Markets

Agricultural Products provides a wide range of proprietary, branded products—based on both patented and off-patent technologies—for worldwide markets. Product branding is a prevalent industry practice used to help maintain
and grow market share by promoting consumer recognition and the reputation of the product and the supplier. While our position is particularly strong in North America, we derived more than half of Agricultural Products’ revenue from outside
North America in 2002.

In contrast to most other
major crop protection companies, insecticides dominate our Agricultural Products segment, particularly pyrethroid and carbamate chemistries in which we maintain leading global positions, based on revenues. Pyrethroids are a major class of
insecticides whose low spread rates are unique compared to other classes of insecticides. They are most effective against worm pests. Carbamates are a broad spectrum of insecticides used to control a wide variety of pests in both soil and foliage.
We also maintain niche positions in the herbicide market. We differentiate ourselves through a highly-focused strategy in selected crops and regions and leverage our proprietary chemistries and pest-specific R&D to develop and market new
insecticides and new applications of our existing products. The following table summarizes the principal product chemistries in Agricultural Products and the principal uses of each chemistry:


Recently, we
entered into several agreements with ISK, under which we will work together to market and distribute existing and new insecticide chemistries in various markets. With the ISK alliance, we have expanded our distribution capabilities in Japan and in
Europe by jointly investing with ISK in the Belgian-based pesticide distribution company, Belchim Benelux N.V. Through these alliances and our own targeted marketing efforts, we expect to continue to enhance our access to markets and develop new
products that will help us continue to compete effectively.

Research and Development

We plan to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines as well as complementary chemistries from other pesticide companies. We have recently obtained new labels for zeta-cypermethrin for use on corn, rice,
alfalfa, sugar cane and leafy vegetable crops. Meanwhile, our carfentrazone herbicide has been approved for cotton defoliation in North America. In addition, we continue to develop new applications for sulfentrazone and clomazone herbicides.

In the next few years, we expect to launch on an
exclusive basis, in the Americas, a novel sucking pest insecticide discovered by ISK. The EPA has prioritized this patented new chemistry for registration in certain applications as an organophosphate alternative. The EPA is encouraging the
development of alternative products for organophosphates, currently the number one class of insecticides in terms of worldwide demand.

We are among the first agrochemicals companies to pursue a predominantly genomics-based approach in our long-term discovery efforts to
identify compounds with a specific biological function on agricultural pests. We believe this approach, which is used extensively in the pharmaceutical industry, will enable a more rapid and cost-effective way to discover new insecticide chemistries
that target unique mechanisms of action in economically important insects.

Industry Overview

The three principal categories of agricultural chemicals are herbicides, representing approximately half of global industry revenue, insecticides, representing approximately a quarter of global industry revenue, and fungicides
representing the remaining portion of global industry revenue. We do not participate in the fungicide category.

Insecticides are used to control a wide range of insects, including chewing pests (such as caterpillars) and sucking pests (such as
aphids). Insecticides are applied as sprays, dusts or granules and are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits, vegetables, cotton, soybean, corn and cereal crops. There are several major classes of insecticide chemistries, including
organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids.

Herbicides prevent or inhibit weed growth, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for manual or mechanical weeding. Herbicides can be selective (killing only specific unwanted foliage) or non-selective (killing all foliage), and
are also segmented by their time of application: pre-planting, pre-emergent and post-emergent.

The agrochemicals industry has recently undergone significant consolidation. Based on sales and giving effect to recent acquisitions, the top crop protection companies, Syngenta AG, Bayer AG, Monsanto
Company, BASF AG, The Dow Chemical Company and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (“DuPont”), currently represent more than three quarters of global sales, while in 1995, the top six companies represented approximately half of global
sales. Four of the these companies, Syngenta, Bayer, BASF and Dow, have all made significant acquisitions of other crop protection companies over the past few years. A significant driver for this consolidation has been the advent of biotechnology
and the resulting escalation of research and development costs, particularly in herbicides employed in row crops.

The next tier agrochemical producers, including Makhteshim-Agan Industries Ltd., Sumitomo Chemical Company Limited, FMC and Nufarm
Limited, generally employ strategies focusing on niche crops and markets


(i.e., fruits, vegetables, household plants, turf and ornamental markets and/or generic products). Additionally, there is an emerging trend
among these producers to partner with one another to gain economies of scale more comparable to larger competitors.

Specialty Chemicals

Financial Information (In Millions)

Overview

Our Specialty Chemicals segment, which
represents 26 percent of our consolidated revenues, is focused on high-performance food ingredients, pharmaceutical excipients and intermediates, and lithium specialty products that enjoy solid customer bases and consistent, growing demand. The
majority of Specialty Chemicals revenues are to customers in non-cyclical end markets. We believe that our future growth in this segment will continue to be based on the performance capabilities of these products and our research and development
capabilities, as well as on the alliances and close working relationships developed with key global customers.

Products and Markets


BioPolymer

BioPolymer is a supplier of
microcrystalline cellulose, carrageenan and alginates—ingredients that have high value-added applications in the production of food, pharmaceutical and other specialty consumer and industrial products. Microcrystalline cellulose, processed from
specialty grades of wood pulp, provides binding and disintegrant properties for tablets and capsules and has unique functionality that improves the texture and stability of many food products. Carrageenan and alginates, both processed from seaweed,
are used in a wide variety of food, pharmaceutical and specialty areas.

BioPolymer is organized around three major markets—food, pharmaceutical and specialty ingredients—and is a key supplier to many companies in these markets. Many of BioPolymer’s customers have come to rely on
FMC for the majority of their supply requirements for these product lines. We believe that such reliance is based on our innovative solutions and operational quality. The following chart summarizes the major markets for BioPolymer’s products
and our chemistries in each market:

Lithium

Lithium is a vertically-integrated,
technology-based business, based on both inorganic and organic lithium chemistries. While lithium is sold into a variety of end-markets, we have focused our efforts on selected growth niches such as fine chemicals for pharmaceutical synthesis,
specialty polymers and energy storage.

The
electrochemical properties of lithium make it an ideal material for portable energy storage in high performance applications, including heart pacemakers, cell phones, camcorders, personal computers and next-generation technologies that combine
cellular and wireless capabilities into a single device. Lithium is also being developed as the enabling element in advanced batteries for use in hybrid electric vehicles.

Organolithium products are sold to fine chemical and pharmaceutical customers who use lithium’s unique
chemical properties to synthesize high value-added products. Organolithiums are also highly valued in the specialty polymer markets as polymer initiators in the production of synthetic rubbers and elastomers. Based on our proprietary technology, the
lithium business is developing new, highly specialized polymers for a variety of end uses, such as rocket fuels, industrial applications and automotive coatings.


The following
chart summarizes the major markets for various lithium products:

Industry Overview

Food Ingredients

Our BioPolymers business serves the texture, structure and
physical stability ingredients (“TSPS”) market. TSPS imparts physical properties to thicken and stabilize foods. There is a wide range of ingredients used for TSPS and a wide range of food groups served, including bakery, meats, dairy and
convenience products. The industry is dispersed geographically, with the majority of the sales in Europe, North America and Asia.

The industry has experienced steady revenue growth over the last five years. Trends driving growth include increasing consumer interest in
healthier foods, greater convenience and growth in per capita consumption of processed foods in emerging markets. The trend toward health and convenience drive the need for more functional ingredients to impart desired food tastes and textures.
Carrageenan and microcrystalline cellulose (“MCC”), which address this need, are growing faster than the overall TSPS market. The global customer base for TSPS is relatively fragmented and includes large and small food processors.
Consolidation among these customers has been a significant trend. Over the past several years, large companies have merged with other large market participants (notably, Slimfast Foods Company/Bestfoods/Unilever PLC, Nabisco Group Holdings
Corp./Kraft Foods Inc., The Pillsbury Company/General Mills, Inc., Suiza Foods Corporation/Dean Foods Company) and have grown at twice the rate of smaller firms. In light of these conditions, TSPS ingredient suppliers such as FMC have focused on
establishing strategic alliances with market leaders with the goal of reducing costs, leveraging technology and expanding product offerings with key accounts.

Within the entire food ingredients market, there are a relatively large number of suppliers, due principally to the broad spectrum of
chemistries employed. Segment leadership, global position and investment in technology are key factors to sustaining profitability. In addition, larger suppliers may often provide a broader product line and a range of services including functional
systems or blends. The top suppliers of TSPS ingredients include Danisco A/S, DuPont, CP Kelco ApS, Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, Cargill Incorporated, Sobel N.V., DGF Stoess AG, FMC, Degussa AG, and Tate & Lyle PLC.


Pharmaceutical Chemicals

Our BioPolymers business sells into the formulation chemicals segment of the pharmaceutical market. The major end markets for formulation chemicals include coatings and colors, fillers, binders, sweeteners and flavors, disintegrants
and others.

Competitors tend to be grouped by
chemistry. Our principal MCC competitors in pharmaceuticals include J. Rettenmaier & Sôhne GmbH, Ming Tai Chemical Co., Ltd., Asahi Kasei Corporation and Blanver Farmoquimica Ltda. While pricing pressures from low cost producers is a
common competitive dynamic, companies like FMC offset that pressure by providing the most reliable and broadest range of products and services. Customers of excipients are pharmaceutical firms who depend upon reliable therapeutic performance of
their drug products.

We also supply alginates
into food and health care markets. Highly refined extracts from selected seaweeds provide a broad range of alginate functionality, including uses in anti-reflux disorders, dental impressions, control release of drugs and wound dressings as well as
food texture management.

Lithium Specialties

Lithium is a highly versatile metal with
diverse end-use markets including glass/ceramics, aluminum production, pharmaceuticals, polymers and both rechargeable and disposable batteries.

We market a wide variety of lithium-based products ranging from upstream, commodity lithium carbonate to highly specialized downstream
products such as organolithium compounds and cathodic materials for batteries. In recent years, lithium carbonate has experienced a significant price decline due largely to industry oversupply.

New entry into the specialty lithium markets is difficult due
to the level of proprietary process and product technology involved. Three major companies (FMC, Chemetall SA and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A.) produce lithium carbonate. The markets for specialty lithium products tend to be concentrated
in more developed regions, including North America, Europe and Asia.

Industrial Chemicals

Financial
Information (In millions)


Overview

Our Industrial Chemicals segment, which
represents 41 percent of our consolidated revenues, has low-cost positions in high-volume inorganic chemicals including soda ash, phosphorus chemicals and hydrogen peroxide, complemented by high-value niche positions in specialty alkali, phosphorus
and peroxygen products.

Products and Markets

Industrial Chemicals serves a diverse group of markets, from economically sensitive industrial sectors to technology-intensive specialty markets. We process and sell refined inorganic products that are sought by customers for their
critical reactivity or specific functionality. In addition, we produce, purify and market higher-value downstream derivatives into specialized and customer-specific applications. These applications include dialysis, rocket propulsion, animal
nutrition, biocides, semiconductors and baking.

Alkali

Our alkali
chemical division produces natural soda ash. Soda ash is used by manufacturers in the glass, chemical processing and detergent industries. To a lesser degree, we also produce sodium bicarbonate, caustic soda and sodium sesquicarbonate. Our products
are manufactured and sold through FMC Wyoming Corporation, which we manage as an integral part of our alkali business in which we own shares representing an 87.5 percent economic interest, with the remaining shares held by two Japanese companies.

We mine and produce natural soda ash using
proprietary, low-cost mining technologies, such as long-wall and solution mining, which, we believe, gives FMC the lowest cost versus other suppliers. Our two production sites in Green River, Wyoming have the capacity to produce approximately 4.9
million tons of soda ash annually, though the business over the last several years has mothballed 1.3 million tons of capacity to improve cost structure and to respond to market conditions.

Peroxygens

We produce hydrogen peroxide worldwide, with production
facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico, through Foret, in Spain and the Netherlands, and through a joint venture company, in Thailand. We sell hydrogen peroxide into the pulp and paper industry, and to a lesser extent, in the
electronics, chemical processing, food and textiles industries. We believe we are a leading North American producer of hydrogen peroxide due in part to our broad product line, geographically-advantaged plant locations, and our state-of-the-art
processing technology. Hydrogen peroxide represents three quarters of our peroxygens sales.

Our specialty peroxygens business supplies persulfate products primarily to polymer and printed circuit board markets and peracetic acid predominately to the food industry for biocidal applications.
Typically, we compete as a specialty player where we believe that we are differentiated by our strong technical expertise, unique process technology and geographic location.


Foret

Our European subsidiary, Foret,
headquartered in Barcelona, Spain, is a leader in providing chemical products to the detergent, paper, textile, tanning and chemical industries. Foret is a large and diverse operation with seven manufacturing locations in Europe. Foret has positions
in phosphates, hydrogen peroxides, perborates, sulfur derivatives, silicates and zeolites. Foret’s sales efforts are focused in Southern Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

Astaris

Astaris, our 50 percent-owned unconsolidated joint venture with Solutia is one of two large diversified phosphorus chemical suppliers in
the western hemisphere. Astaris was formed as a separate company in 2000 with headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri. Astaris’s products are used in chemical processing, baking, food processing, detergent applications and fire suppressants.

Astaris is shifting its manufacturing process to
take advantage of lower-cost sourcing of phosphorus. We believe that the move from a manufacturing strategy based on elemental phosphorus to one based on purified phosphoric acid (“PPA”) feedstock will eliminate the high environmental
compliance and energy costs that adversely affected our Pocatello elemental phosphorus facility and unfavorably impacted our earnings in recent years.

Industry Overview

We primarily participate in three markets: soda ash, peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals. These products are generally inorganic-based,
produced from minerals or air, and are generally commodities, which, in many cases, have few cost effective substitutes. Growth is typically a function of GDP or the rate of industrialization in key export markets. Pricing tends to reflect
short-term supply and demand as producers add or reduce capacity and demand changes.

Soda Ash

Soda ash is a highly alkaline inorganic chemical essential in the production of glass, and widely used in the production of chemicals, soaps and detergents and many other products. Natural soda ash is generally produced from trona, a
natural form of sodium sesquicarbonate, through mining and chemical processing. Soda ash may also be produced synthetically using the process developed in the 19th century by Ernest Solvay, which uses salt, ammonia, carbon dioxide and limestone as
raw materials. The Solvay process requires a significant amount of heat energy and produces large quantities of waste by-products, making it much less cost-effective than natural soda ash production.

Because of the processing cost advantages of trona and the
large natural reserves of trona in the U.S., particularly in Green River, Wyoming, all U.S. soda ash production is natural. By contrast, due to a lack of trona, a large percentage of the soda ash that is manufactured in the rest of the world is
produced synthetically. Other U.S. producers are OCI Chemical Corporation, Solvay S.A., The General Chemical Group Inc., IMC Global Inc. and American Soda, LLP.

Approximately 30 percent to 35 percent of U.S. natural soda ash production is exported through the American
Natural Soda Ash Association (“ANSAC”). ANSAC is the foreign sales association of all U.S. producers of soda ash, and was established in 1983 under the Webb-Pomerene Act and subsequent legislation. Since its creation, ANSAC has been
successful in coordinating soda ash exports, exploiting the natural cost benefits of U.S.-produced natural soda ash and leveraging its large scale of operations to the benefit of its member companies. U.S. exports of soda ash have risen
significantly over the last twenty years.

Peroxygens

Hydrogen
peroxide is typically sold in aqueous solutions for use as a bleach or oxidizer. As such, it often competes with other chemicals capable of performing similar functions. Some of our specialty peroxygen


derivatives (e.g., perborates) also function as bleaching or oxidizing agents. Environmental regulations, regional cost differences (often
due to transportation costs) and technical differences in product performance enter into the decision to use hydrogen peroxide or one of its derivatives rather than another product. Since these considerations vary by region, the consumption patterns
vary in different parts of the world. Hydrogen peroxide is sold in aqueous solutions, usually 35 percent, 50 percent or 70 percent by weight.

The U.S. pulp and paper industry represents approximately 65 percent of domestic demand for hydrogen peroxide. In this market, hydrogen
peroxide is used as an environmentally friendly bleaching agent to brighten chemical, mechanical and recycled pulps, as well as treat a wide range of mill pollutants in the waste stream. During the 1990s the hydrogen peroxide market became
increasingly cyclical dependent on the pulp industry, which has recently experienced a general slowdown. In addition, demand growth for hydrogen peroxide has slowed as the conversion from elemental chlorine by the U.S. pulp industry is largely
complete. These trends have had a negative effect on pricing. The other North American hydrogen peroxide producers are Akzo Nobel, N.V., ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc., Degussa AG, Kemira Oyj and Solvay.

Phosphorus Chemicals

Phosphorus chemicals are used in many industrial applications
in a wide array of chemical compounds. Overall growth in demand for phosphorus chemicals tends to correlate with GDP. Phosphoric acid and phosphate salts (e.g., sodium phosphates, calcium phosphates, potassium phosphates) are sold into many markets
including food, beverage, water treatment, automotive, metal cleaning, detergents, specialty agricultural and fire suppressants.

The basic feed for making phosphorus chemicals is now produced using two processes. Most industrial applications use the cost-effective
process which involves making PPA by the purification of fertilizer-grade phosphoric acid. Thermal phosphoric acid, long the industry standard, is produced from elemental phosphorus but is far more costly due to energy and environmental compliance
costs, and is now used mainly in limited applications. While Astaris ceased the production of elemental phosphorus in 2001, it is still produced by Monsanto in the United States, Thermphos in the Netherlands, and in several other countries,
principally China.

Worldwide demand for
phosphorus chemicals declined in the early 1990s as detergents containing phosphates for home-laundry use were banned in North America and parts of Europe. Though not projected to occur in 2003, over the next few years, industrial demand for
phosphorus chemicals is expected to improve, driven by growing demand in the detergents and food and beverage industries in newly industrializing nations, and by the growth of food and beverage applications in the United States and Europe.

Beginning in the 1990s, reduced demand, the
shift in growth toward developing regions, and the advent of new technology resulted in a significant restructuring of the phosphorus chemicals industry as producers consolidated or exited the business.

In North America, we participate in the industrial phosphate
business through our Astaris joint venture. In Europe, we participate in this business through Foret. Both Astaris and Foret use the PPA process. Major competitors include Rhodia, S.A., Potash Corporation of Saskachewan, Inc., Prayon Rupel, S.A.,
and Rotem Amfer & Negev Ltd.

Source and Availability of
Raw Materials

Our raw material requirements
vary by business segment and include mineral-related natural resources (trona ore, lithium brines and phosphate rock), processed chemicals, seaweed, specialty wood pulp and energy sources such as oil, gas, coal and electricity. Raw materials
represented approximately 30 percent of our 2002 cost of sales and services, and no one raw material represented more than 7 percent of our total raw material purchases.


Ores used in
Industrial Chemicals manufacturing processes, such as trona, are extracted from mines in the U.S. on property held by FMC under long-term leases subject to periodic adjustment of royalty rates. Raw materials used by Specialty Chemicals include
lithium carbonate, which is currently obtained from a South American manufacturer under a long-term sourcing agreement, various types of seaweed that are sourced on a global basis and wood pulp, which is purchased from several North American
producers. Raw materials used by Agricultural Products, primarily processed chemicals, are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide.

Patents

FMC owns a number of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to its business. We do not believe
that the loss of any one or group of related patents, trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of FMC. The duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions. Their expiration dates range
through 2020.

Seasonality

The seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the
geographic spread of the Agricultural Products business generally produce stronger earnings in the second and third quarters. Agricultural products sold into the northern hemisphere (North America, Europe and parts of Asia) serve seasonal
agricultural markets from March through September, while markets in the southern hemisphere (Latin America and parts of the Asia Pacific region, including Australia) are served from July through February. The remainder of our businesses are
generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations.

Competition

We have a
number one or number two market position in many of our product lines, based on revenue, either globally or in North America, largely as a result of our proprietary technologies and, with respect to Industrial Chemicals, our position as a low-cost
producer. The following product lines accounted for approximately 77 percent of our 2002 consolidated revenue:

Competitive Conditions

We encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments. This competition is expected to continue in both the United
States and markets outside the United States. We market our products through our own sales organization and through independent distributors and sales representatives. The number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment. In
general, we compete by operating in a cost-efficient manner and by leveraging our industry experience to provide advanced technology, high product quality and reliability and quality customer and technical service.

Our Agricultural Products segment competes in the global crop
protection market for insecticides and herbicides. The industry is characterized by a small number of large competitors and a large number of smaller,


often regional competitors such as FMC. Industry products include crop protection chemicals and, for major competitors, genetically
engineered (crop biotechnology) products. Competition from generic producers has increased as a significant number of product patents have expired in the last decade. In general, we compete as a product innovator by focusing on insecticide discovery
and development and licensing products from alliances when the products complement our product portfolio. We also differentiate ourselves by reacting quickly in key markets, establishing effective product stewardship programs, and developing
strategic alliances, which strengthen market access in key countries.

With significant positions in markets that include alginate, carrageenan, microcrystalline cellulose and lithium-based products, Specialty Chemicals competes on the basis of product differentiation, customer service and
price. BioPolymer competes with both direct suppliers of cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids, which may provide similar functionality in specific applications. In microcrystalline cellulose, competitors are
typically smaller than FMC, while in seaweed extracts (alginates), we compete with other broad-based chemical companies. FMC and each of its two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring, lithium-rich
brines located in the Andes mountains of Argentina and Chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium.

Industrial Chemicals serves the alkali, peroxygens and phosphorus markets predominantly in the United States and to a lesser extent,
Europe. In North America, the soda ash business competes with five domestic producers of natural soda ash, three of which operate in the vicinity of our mine and processing facility in Green River, Wyoming. Outside of North America and Europe, FMC
sells soda ash through ANSAC. Internationally, FMC’s natural soda ash competes with synthetic soda ash manufactured by numerous producers, ranging from integrated multinational companies to smaller regional players. Hydrogen peroxide maintains
a leading position in the North American market for hydrogen peroxide. There are currently five firms competing in the hydrogen peroxide market in North America. The primary competitive factor affecting the sales of soda ash and hydrogen peroxide is
price. We seek to maintain our competitive position by employing low cost processing technology. At Foret, we possess a strong cost and market position in phosphates, perborates, peroxygens, zeolites and sulfur derivatives. In each of these markets
we face significant competition from a range of multinational and regional chemical producers. We participate in the phosphorus chemicals business in the United States through Astaris. Competition in phosphorus chemicals is based primarily on both
product differentiation and price.

We perform product research and
development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in our Agricultural Products segment. The product development efforts in our Agricultural Products segment focus on developing more environmentally compatible solutions that
can cost-effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to insect-resistant chemistries. Our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below:

Environmental Laws
and Regulations

We are subject to various
federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants, discharges of water pollutants, and the manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of


hazardous substances, hazardous wastes and other toxic materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We are also subject to liabilities
arising under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar state laws that impose responsibility on persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances, and on current and
previous owners and operators of a facility for the clean-up of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment. In addition, we are subject to liabilities under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and
analogous state laws that require owners and operators of facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste to follow certain waste management practices and to clean up releases of hazardous waste into the environment associated with past
or present practices.

We have been named a
potentially responsible party, or PRP, at 26 sites on the federal government’s National Priority List. In addition, we also have received notice from the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or other regulatory agencies that we may
be a Potentially Responsible Party (“PRP”), or PRP equivalent, at other sites, including 43 sites at which we have determined that it is reasonably possible that we have an environmental liability. In cooperation with appropriate
government agencies, we are currently participating in, or have participated in, a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (“RI/FS”) or its equivalent at most of the identified sites, with the status of each investigation varying from
site to site. At certain sites, a RI/FS has only recently begun, providing limited information, if any, relating to cost estimates, timing, or the involvement of other PRPs; whereas, at other sites, the studies are complete, remedial action plans
have been chosen, or a Record of Decision has (“ROD”) been issued.

Environmental liabilities include obligations relating to waste handling and the remediation and/or study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of regulated materials. These sites include
current operations, previously operated sites, and sites associated with discontinued operations. We have provided reserves for potential environmental obligations that management considers probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the
obligation could be made. As of December 31, 2002, our total environmental reserve (after accounting for any potential recoveries from third parties, which we estimate at $27.7 million) was $195.7 million compared to $218.9 million at December 31,
2001 (after accounting for recoveries of $41.5 million). In addition, we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed this reserve by as much as $80.0 million at December 31, 2002.

Employees

We employ approximately 5,500 people, with approximately 3,000 people in our domestic operations and
approximately 2,500 people in our foreign operations. Approximately 30 percent of our U.S.-based employees and approximately 40 percent of our foreign-based employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements. We have successfully
concluded virtually all of our recent negotiations without a work stoppage. In those rare instances where a work stoppage has occurred, there has been no material effect on consolidated sales and earnings. We cannot predict, however, the outcome of
future contract negotiations.

ITEM
2.    PROPERTIES

FMC
leases executive offices in Philadelphia and subleases administrative offices from Technologies in Chicago. We operate 37 manufacturing facilities and mines in 19 countries. Our major research and development facility is in Princeton, New Jersey.

Trona ore, used for soda ash production in Green
River, Wyoming, is mined primarily from property held under long-term leases. We own the land and mineral rights to the Salar del Hombre Muerto lithium reserves in Argentina. A number of our chemical plants require the basic raw materials which are
provided by these FMC-owned or leased mines, without which other sources would have to be obtained. With regard to our mining properties operated under long-term leases, no single lease or related group of leases is material to our businesses or to
our company as a whole.


Most of our
plant sites are owned, with some under lease. We believe our properties and facilities meet present requirements and are in good operating condition and that each of our significant manufacturing facilities is operating at a level consistent with
capacity utilization prevalent in the industries in which it operates. The number and location of our production properties for continuing operations are:

ITEM
3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Like hundreds of other industrial companies, we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestos-related personal injury litigation. These cases (most cases involve between 50 and 350 defendants) allege personal injury or death
resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of FMC or to asbestos-containing components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations. The machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not
fabricate the asbestos-containing component parts at issue in the litigation, and to this day, neither the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration nor the EPA has banned the use of these components. Further, the asbestos-containing
materials were housed inside of machinery and equipment and accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance. Therefore, we believe that, overall, the claims against FMC are without merit and consider ourselves to be a peripheral
defendant in these matters. Indeed, the bulk of the claims against us to date have been dismissed without payment.

As of December 31, 2002, there were approximately 26,000 premises and product claims pending against FMC in several jurisdictions. To
date, we have had discharged, all before trial, approximately 51,000 claims against FMC, the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the plaintiff. The costs of all settlements to date have totaled approximately $3
million.

We intend to continue managing these
cases in accordance with our historical experience. We have established a reserve for this litigation and believe that the outcome of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or
financial condition.

We are party to various
other lawsuits, both as defendant and plaintiff, arising in the normal course of business. We believe that the disposition of these lawsuits will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
operations, cash flows or financial condition.

See Note 1 “Principal Accounting Policies—Environmental Obligations,” Note 11 “Environmental Obligations” and Note 17 “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” in the company’s consolidated
financial statements beginning on page 51, page 72 and page 85, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

The FMC Corporation Incentive Compensation and Stock Plan (the “Plan”) was approved by the stockholders on April 20, 2001. The provisions for incentives under the Plan provide for the grant of multi-year incentive
awards payable partly in cash and partly in common stock. The provisions under the Plan and its predecessor plans for stock options provide for regular grants of common stock options, which may be incentive and/or nonqualified stock options. The
exercise price for stock options is not less than the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. Options are exercisable approximately four years from the grant date for grants prior to 1995 and approximately three years from the grant
date for grants during 1995 and thereafter. Incentive and nonqualified options expire not later than 10 years from the grant date (15 years for grants prior to 1996).

Under the FMC Corporation Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, non-employee directors were granted
options in 1998 and 1999 to purchase shares of stock at the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. At December 31, 2002, options for 46,040 shares were outstanding at prices ranging from $33.76 to $40.56. These grants vested one year
from the grant date and expire after ten years. Beginning in 2000, non-employee directors were paid in restricted stock units in lieu of stock options.


ITEM
6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA

The selected consolidated financial and other data presented below for, and as of the end of, each of the years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2002, are derived from our consolidated financial statements, which have been
audited by KPMG LLP, independent auditors. The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002, and the report thereon, are included elsewhere in this
Form 10-K. The selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002, the related notes, and the independent auditors’ report, which refers to the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” on January 1, 2002 and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” on January 1, 2001, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.


(1)

In 2001 we spun off FMC Technologies, Inc. (“Technologies”). This business has been accounted for as a discontinued business. Accordingly, the consolidated
statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, 1999 and 1998 have been reclassified to reflect Technologies as a discontinued operation.

(2)

Effective April 1, 2000, we and Solutia Inc. formed Astaris, LLC, a joint venture that includes the North American and Brazilian phosphorus chemicals operations of
both companies. We have accounted for our investment in Astaris under the equity method. Prior to the formation of Astaris, revenue from our phosphorus chemicals business was $327.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 and $79.2 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2000.

(3)

In 1999, we completed the following transactions relating to our Specialty Chemicals segment: (i) sold our Bioproducts business which had 1999 revenue of $13.3
million; (ii) sold our process additives business which had 1999 revenue of $98.5 million; and (iii) acquired the assets of Pronova Biopolymer AS. Additionally, in 1999 we acquired the assets of Tg Soda Ash, Inc., which are now included in our
Industrial Chemicals segment.

(4)

Discontinued operations, net of income taxes includes the following items related to our discontinued businesses: gains and losses, increased estimates of our
liabilities for general liability, workers’ compensation, postretirement benefit obligations, legal defense, property maintenance and other costs, losses for the settlement of litigation and increases in environmental reserves.

(5)

Balance sheet data is not presented for periods prior to December 31, 2001 because these balance sheets would not be comparable due to the spin-off of Technologies
that became effective on December 31, 2001.

(6)

In calculating this ratio, earnings consist of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
less minority interests, less interest expense, net, less amortization expense related to debt discounts, fees and expenses, less amortization of capitalized interest, less interest included in rental expenses (assumed to be one third of rent) and
plus undistributed earnings of affiliates. Fixed charges consist of interest expense, net, amortization of debt discounts, fees and expenses, interest capitalized as part of fixed assets and interest included in rental expenses. For the year ended
December 31, 2001 earnings did not cover fixed charges, with deficiencies of $331.4 million. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges would have been a negative 5.4x at December 31, 2001.

anticipated or unanticipated events.

Among the
factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are:

Industry Risks

:

Pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including:

•

Capacity Utilization—Our Industrial Chemicals businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization. As a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity
utilization changes occur within our industry.

•

Competition—All of our segments face competition, which could affect our ability to raise prices or successfully enter certain markets.

•

Climatic Conditions—Our Agricultural Products markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely affect crop pricing and pest infestations. The
nature of these events makes them difficult to predict.

•

Changing Regulatory Environment—Changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the United States, could adversely impact our ability to continue selling
certain products in our domestic and foreign markets.

•

Changes in Our Customer Base—Our customer base has the potential to change, especially when long-term supply contracts are renegotiated. Our Industrial
Chemicals and Specialty Chemicals businesses are most sensitive to this risk.

•

Energy Costs—Energy costs represent a significant portion of our manufacturing costs and dramatic increases in such costs could have an adverse affect on our
results of operations.

•

Unforeseen Economic and Political Change—Our business could be adversely affected by unforeseen economic and political changes in the international markets
where we compete including: war, civil unrest, inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the United States or any of the foreign countries in which FMC does business; change in
governmental laws and regulations and the level of enforcement of these laws and regulations; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control.


•

Litigation and Environmental Risks—Current reserves relating to FMC’s ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may prove inadequate.

•

Production Hazards—Our facilities are subject to operating hazards, which may disrupt our business.

Technology Risks:

•

Failure to make continued improvements in our product technology and new product introductions could impede our competitive position, particularly in Agricultural
Products and Specialty Chemicals.

•

Failure to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs could impede our competitive position.

Financial Risks:

•

We have certain commitments, guarantees and outstanding litigation which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.

•

We are an international company and therefore face foreign exchange rate risks. We are particularly sensitive to the euro and the Brazilian real. To a lesser extent,
we are sensitive to Asian currencies, particularly the Japanese yen.

•

We have a number of agreements with our former subsidiary, Technologies, dealing with matters such as tax sharing and insurance. Under certain circumstances, we may
incur liabilities under these agreements and become entitled to be indemnified by Technologies. Our ability to be indemnified will depend on the ability of Technologies to pay us.

•

We have significant deferred income tax assets. The carrying value of these assets is dependent upon the future performance of FMC.

•

Obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. To the extent our plans’ actual experience differs from these
assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly.

•

We have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market
conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities.


ITEM
7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our Company

We are a diversified, global chemical company providing innovative solutions and applications to a wide variety of end markets. We operate
in three business segments: Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals. Agricultural Products’ principal focus is on insecticides, which are used to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a wide spectrum of
pests, and on herbicides, which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth. Specialty Chemicals consists of our biopolymers and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are
used to enhance texture, structure and physical stability, pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis and energy storage. Our Industrial Chemicals segment manufactures a wide range
of inorganic materials, including soda ash, peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals.

Agricultural Products

Our Agricultural Products segment manufactures and sells proprietary, branded insecticides and herbicides. We have a strong position in two widely-used classes of insecticides, pyrethroids and
carbamates, and possess a niche portfolio of proprietary herbicides. These products are used for the protection of cotton, corn, rice, cereals, vegetables and other crops. In addition in North America we sell into the professional pest control and
home and garden markets. We differentiate ourselves through a highly-focused strategy in selected crops and regions, and by leveraging proprietary chemistries and pest-specific research and development (“R&D”) to develop and market new
insecticides and new applications of our existing products. We have also developed strategic alliances with companies such as Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Ltd. (“ISK”), a Japanese crop protection company, to access new markets and develop new
insecticides.

Specialty Chemicals

Our Specialty Chemicals segment is
comprised of our biopolymers and lithium businesses. BioPolymer manufactures and sells microcrystalline cellulose, carrageenan and alginates, products that add texture, structure and physical stability to a wide range of beverage, dairy, meat and
bakery products and/or that act as binders and disintegrants for tablets and capsules. Our lithium business is a technology-based business in which mined lithium is processed and sold for use in a broad array of specialty products, including
pharmaceuticals, specialty polymers and energy storage devices. The majority of Specialty Chemicals’ sales are to customers engaged in non-cyclical end markets, such as food and pharmaceuticals.

Industrial Chemicals

Our Industrial Chemicals segment manufactures soda ash,
peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals. Through our manufacturing facility in Green River, Wyoming, we process naturally occurring soda ash, a commonly used ingredient in detergents and chemical processing and an essential ingredient in glass. We
produce hydrogen peroxide, leveraging our geographically advantaged plant locations throughout North America to reach our customers. We also market specialty grades of hydrogen peroxide and specialty peroxygens to the electronics, polymers and food
processing industries. Our European subsidiary, FMC Foret, S.A. (“Foret”), leverages its low production costs and strong brand name to manufacture and sell phosphorus chemicals, peroxygens, sulfur derivatives, silicates, zeolites and other
products in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. We are also a 50 percent owner with Solutia, Inc. (“Solutia”) of Astaris LLC (“Astaris”), a North American producer of phosphorus chemicals used in a wide array of markets,
including the detergent, food, agricultural and industrial markets. We account for Astaris as an equity investment. The majority of Industrial Chemicals’ sales are to customers engaged in relatively non-cyclical end markets.

The Reorganization of Our Company

We implemented our plan to split FMC into separate chemical
and machinery companies in 2001 through a two-step process. The first step included an initial public offering (“IPO”) of 17 percent of FMC Technologies,


Inc. (“Technologies”), which took place in the second quarter of 2001. Technologies consists of our former Energy Systems and Food
and Transportation Systems business segments. Subsequent to the IPO, Technologies made net payments of $430.7 million to FMC in exchange for the net assets distributed to Technologies on June 1, 2001, which we used to retire short-term and long-term
debt. The second step, the distribution of our remaining 83 percent ownership in Technologies (the “spin-off”) occurred on December 31, 2001. Total net assets distributed on December 31, 2001 were $509.5 million.

We believe that the spin-off of Technologies has allowed us to
focus our efforts in the chemical industry through improved customer orientation, increased innovation and overall growth in certain businesses. In an effort to align our business with our future growth plans, we took various strategic measures in
2002, 2001 and 2000, including the restructuring of businesses, reduction of staff, plant shut downs, plant mothballing and the impairment of certain underperforming assets. We believe these steps will increase our financial flexibility as operating
conditions change.

Application of Critical Accounting
Policies

Our consolidated financial
statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of asset,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have described our accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those which we believe to be
critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical. Critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of
results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors.

Environmental

We provide for environmental-related obligations when they
are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability
and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used.

Estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), or similar
government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a Record of Decision (“ROD”), or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (“RI/FS”) that is accepted by FMC and the
appropriate government agency or agencies. Estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management, as well as by our financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. The
estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.

Our liabilities for continuing and discontinued
operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and/or study of sites at which our company is alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances. Such costs principally include, among other items, RI/FS, site remediation, costs of
operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. Estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws
and technologies, specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites.

Provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named Potentially Responsible
Parties (“PRPs”) or other third parties. Such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values.


In
calculating and evaluating the adequacy of its environmental reserves, the company has taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and
the analogous state laws on all PRPs and has considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other PRPs at each site to the extent possible. We also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom
recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. Although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of PRPs and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each
party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site-by-site basis. Our liability includes management’s best estimate of the costs expected to be paid
before its consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. We believe that any recorded recoveries related to PRPs are realizable in all material respects. We have recorded recoveries in “Environmental reserves, continuing and
discontinued,” representing probable realization of claims against insurance companies, U.S. government agencies and other third parties, of $27.7 million and $41.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002 and 2001. These recoveries are
recorded as an offset to the “Environmental reserve, continuing and discontinued.” Cash recoveries for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $16.2 million, $12.5 million and $14.2 million, respectively. We expect to continue to receive
payments for recoveries in the future. Our total environmental reserves, before recoveries, totaled $223.4 million and $260.4 million at December 31, 2002, and 2001, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2002 we have estimated that reasonably
possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as $80 million.

Impairments and valuation of long-lived assets

Our long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and long-term investments, goodwill and intangible assets. We review the
carrying value of these assets for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets.” The standard requires that we test
for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. In cases
where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets. The fair value of long-lived
assets is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable. The estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices, volumes, costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time. We recognized $323.1 million and
$10.1 million in asset impairments in 2001 and 2000, respectively, related to our Industrial Chemicals and Specialty Chemicals segments.

We also prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”
The fair value of goodwill and intangible assets is based on estimated discounted cash flows. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include management’s best estimate of future growth rates, discount rates and market conditions over a
reasonable period. We performed this test in 2002 and determined that no impairment charge was required. Total goodwill as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $129.7 million and $113.5 million, respectively.

Depreciation for financial reporting is reported on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the fixed asset. Estimated useful lives are based on historical useful-life trends as well as common industry practice. Useful lives are as follows: 20 years—land improvements, 20 to 50
years—buildings (depending on location and use), 3 to 18 years machinery and equipment (depending on type and use). Depreciation expense totaled $105.2 million, $112.2 million and $116.3 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Pension and other postretirement benefits

We provide qualified and nonqualified
defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as other postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees. The costs (or benefits) and


obligations related to these benefits reflect our key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including interest (discount)
rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees. The costs (or benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, including
things such as the average retirement age, mortality tables, employee turnover, and plan participation. To the extent our plans’ actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own
plans’ demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans’ funding requirements, could increase or decrease. When actual results differ from our assumptions, the
difference is typically recognized over future periods.

We use certain calculated values of assets under methods permitted under SFAS No. 87, “Employer’s Accounting for Pensions,” (“SFAS 87”) both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of
pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market-related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five-year period. We use an actuarial
value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements. The actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range, high or low, of the actual market value of assets, and is adjusted accordingly.

The unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and
postretirement benefit obligations may affect periodic benefit costs in future periods, however, we do not expect this to have a significant impact in 2003.

We recorded $4.9 million and $4.0 million of pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and a $5.1
million credit in pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2000. We expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs to increase in 2003, due to a combination of factors, including changes in key assumptions such as the discount rate
and an increase in the amortization of prior service cost. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, $106.6 million and $116.7 million, respectively, was recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The recorded amounts for pension
benefit obligations include additional minimum pension liabilities of $84.8 million and $8.3 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, which were recorded as other comprehensive losses in stockholders’ equity. The company’s
operating cash flows for 2002 included a $2.8 million voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. qualified pension plan. Although we are not required to make any cash contributions to this plan in 2003, we are considering making voluntary cash
contributions of approximately $5 million.

We
select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of high-quality corporate bonds (with particular focus on the Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) Aa-rated
Corporate and Industrial bond indices) at the end of each respective year. Bonds in these indices have remaining maturities of at least 20 years and the indices are constructed to have an average remaining maturity of approximately 30 years. We
selected a discount rate of 6.5 percent at December 31, 2002 for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.

As described within SFAS 87, the expected rate of return on plan assets is viewed as a long-term, average rate of return to be earned on
the assets invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In developing the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption for our plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis
(using a geometric average) performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on long-term real return expectations by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these
best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust, which has averaged 12.3 percent over the last 10 years (in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors. The current asset
allocation for our plan is approximately 70 percent equities (U.S. and non-U.S.) and 30 percent fixed-income investments. Given an actively managed investment portfolio, the expected returns by asset class for our portfolio, using a geometric
average, and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately three percent, are between nine and eleven percent for both U.S. and non-U.S. equities, and between five and seven percent for fixed-income


investments, which generates a total expected portfolio return in excess of 9.25 percent. We continually monitor the appropriateness of this
rate in light of current market conditions. For the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in this assumption see our discussion below.

Sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions

.    A one-half percent
increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $47.6 million at December 31, 2002 and $43.7 million at December 31, 2001, and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit
costs by $1.2 million, $1.2 million and $2.6 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $50.5 million at
December 31, 2002 and $46.4 million at December 31, 2001, and increased pension and other postretirement benefit by $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $2.7 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

A one-half percent increase in the assumed expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by $3.0 million, $2.9 million and $4.0 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on assets would have increased
pension costs by $3.0 million, $2.9 million and $4.0 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Income taxes

We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
In assessing the need for this allowance, we have considered future taxable income and our ongoing tax planning strategies. In the event that we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the
future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net
recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the valuation allowance was $22.4 million and $18.0 million, respectively.

Results of Operations—2002, 2001 and 2000

Overview

Our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $1,852.9 million, $1,943.0
million and $2,050.3 million, respectively. In 2002, our first full year as an independent pure-play chemical company, we earned net income of $65.8 million compared to a net loss of $337.7 million in 2001 and net income of $110.6 million in 2000.
Diluted earnings per common share for the year was $1.92 compared to a diluted loss per common share of $10.86 in 2001 and diluted earnings per common share of $3.50 in 2000. Net income for 2002 included restructuring and other charges and a
discontinued operations’ loss totaling $21.7 million after tax or $0.63 per common share on a diluted basis. In 2001 net income included restructuring and other charges, asset impairments and a discontinued operations’ loss totaling $436.1
after tax or $13.96 per common share on a diluted basis. In 2000 net income included restructuring and other charges, asset impairments and a discontinued operations’ loss totaling $42.9 million after tax or $1.36 per common share on a diluted
basis. See “Results of Operations” and “Segment Results” for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for 2002, 2001 and 2000.

All results discussed in this analysis address the continuing results of our chemical businesses. The results of Technologies, which was
spun-off on December 31, 2001, have been reclassified to discontinued operations within our consolidated statement of income for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and consolidated statement of cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2001
and 2000. (See “The Reorganization of Our Company” for an overview of our spin-off of Technologies.)


Results of
Operations—2002 compared to 2001

In
the following discussion, “year” refers to the year ending December 31, 2002 and “prior year” refers to the year ending December 31, 2001. All comparisons are between these periods unless otherwise noted.

Revenue

for the year ended December 31, 2002 was
$1,852.9 million compared to $1,943.0 million in 2001, down 5 percent. Lower revenue in 2002 compared to 2001 was principally attributable to lower revenue in our Industrial Chemicals and Agricultural Products segments. Our Industrial Chemicals
segment saw generally lower selling prices and lower sales volumes due to unfavorable market conditions. Also affecting revenue were decreased Agricultural Products sales resulting from lower herbicide sales and unfavorable weather conditions in
Asia. In 2003, we expect increased revenue from our Specialty Chemicals and Agricultural Products segments as well as improved domestic markets served by Industrial Chemicals.

Asset impairments.

There were no asset impairments in 2002. Asset impairments
totaled $323.1 million ($233.8 million after tax) in 2001.

Based upon a comprehensive review of our long-lived assets, we recorded asset impairment charges in our Industrial Chemicals and Specialty Chemicals segments in 2001. Industrial Chemicals recorded impairment charges of $224.2 million
of which $12.3 million related to the impairment of assets in our sodium cyanide operations while $211.9 million was for the impairments in our U.S.-based phosphorus chemicals business.

A weakening market in our sodium cyanide business led us to impair the assets of this business in the second
quarter of 2001. We subsequently exited this business in 2002.

Our U.S.-based phosphorus chemicals business is comprised of our 50 percent interest in Astaris and the activities of our corporate phosphorus division, which manages remediation and other environmental projects associated with the
former Astaris elemental phosphorus plant in Pocatello, Idaho.

Based upon a comprehensive review of our long-lived assets, we recorded asset impairment charges of $211.9 million related to our U.S.-based phosphorus business in the second quarter of 2001. The components of asset impairments
related to this business include a $171.0 million impairment of environmental assets built to comply with a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) Consent Decree (the “Consent Decree”) at the Pocatello, Idaho facility, a
further $4.4 million of other non-environmental phosphorus related fixed assets and a $36.5 million impairment charge for our investment in Astaris. Driving these charges were a decline in market conditions, the loss of a potential site on which to
develop an economically viable second purified phosphoric acid (“PPA”) plant and our agreement to pay into a fund for the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes (the “Tribal Fund”) resulting from an agreement to support a proposal to amend the
Consent Decree, which permitted the earlier closure of the largest remaining waste disposal pond at Pocatello.

In addition, we recorded an impairment charge of $98.9 million related to our Specialty Chemicals segment’s lithium operations in
Argentina. We established this operation, which includes a lithium mine and processing facilities, approximately six years ago in a remote area of the Andes Mountains. The entry of a South American manufacturer into this business resulted in
decreased revenues. In addition, market conditions continued to be unfavorable. As a result, our lithium assets in Argentina became impaired, as the total capital invested is not expected to be recovered.

Restructuring and other charges

totaled $30.1 million
($18.4 million after tax) in 2002 compared to $280.4 million ($172.1 million after tax) in 2001.

In an effort to mitigate the effects of the continued economic weakness in the markets served by our Industrial Chemicals business we undertook several key reorganization and cost saving initiatives
that resulted in $12.4 million of restructuring charges in 2002. Included in this amount was a $5.7 million restructuring charge for the mothballing of the basic production line at our hydrogen peroxide facility in Spring Hill, West Virginia. Of the
16 severances incurred related to the Spring Hill mothballing, the majority will occur in the first half of 2003. We also mothballed our Granger caustic facility, in Green River, Wyoming resulting in a $3.4 million restructuring charge. The majority
of this charge was for facility shutdown activities and 110 severances, all of


which occurred in 2002. In addition we recorded a $3.3 million restructuring charge for severance costs related to reorganization efforts to
reduce costs in our U.S. phosphorus chemicals division, alkali, peroxygens and at Foret. The majority of these charges were for 38 severances, all of which occurred in 2002. We estimate that our Industrial Chemicals’ restructuring activities
will result in approximately $13 million of combined annual cost savings and cost avoidance.

In Agricultural Products we incurred $4.7 million of restructuring charges in 2002 of which $3.7 million related to the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in Baltimore in connection
with our new herbicides strategy (See Segment Results—2002 compared to 2001). A $1.0 million restructuring charge was recorded for reorganization costs to implement a new distribution strategy in Europe, which will allow us to rely on certain
strategic alliances to further penetrate and expand our European markets. Of the 108 severances related to these restructurings 57 occurred in 2002. We estimate that the restructuring activities will result in approximately $20 million of combined
annual cost savings and cost avoidance.

We
recorded $1.3 million of restructuring charges in our Specialty Chemicals segment in 2002 in an effort to realign product divisions within BioPolymer, both domestically and internationally. The majority of these costs resulted in the severance of 24
people. These severances are expected to occur in the first half of 2003. We estimated that our Specialty Chemicals’ restructuring activities will result in approximately $2 million of combined annual cost savings and cost avoidance.

Reorganization costs of $3.0 million and other
charges of $8.7 million were also recorded in the period. These charges are discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Also, of the $30.1 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2002 $11.9 million
was spent in 2002. We expect the remainder to be spent in 2003.

In 2001 a change in market conditions and the implementation of our overall corporate strategy resulted in restructuring and other charges of $280.4 million, detailed as follows:

(1)

Partial reversal of Consent Decree obligations.

(2)

Commitment from Astaris related to shutdown and remediation.

(3)

See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

Industrial Chemicals recorded restructuring and other charges of $247.9 million in 2001 of which $6.2 million
was for restructuring at several sites, including $5.7 million for the mothballing of our Granger, Wyoming soda ash facility, and $241.7 million was for our U.S.-based phosphorus business. There were 130 severances from the restructuring of
Industrial Chemicals, the majority of which occurred in 2001, with the remainder occurring in 2002.

In connection with the impairment of our U.S.-based phosphorus chemicals business in the second quarter of 2001 we recorded other charges
for a $68.7 million reserve for further required Consent Decree spending at the Pocatello site related to environmental capital projects required to complete the construction of facilities to treat the sites waste streams, $42.7 million for
financing obligations to the Astaris joint venture (“keepwell” payments) and a $40.0 million payment to the Tribal Fund for various tribe activities in order to permit capping of a specific waste disposal pond at Pocatello.


Subsequent to
the recording of these charges in the second quarter of 2001, the Astaris joint venture announced its plans, in October 2001, to cease production at the Pocatello, Idaho elemental phosphorus facility in December 2001. This decision reflected the
shift in Astaris’s sourcing strategy away from production of high cost elemental phosphorus to lower cost PPA, and also reflected the availability of low-cost alternative feedstock materials, projected higher future environmental compliance
costs at Pocatello and our desire to avoid additional capital spending on environmental compliance assets required under the Consent Decree. In connection with the decision to shut down Pocatello we recorded restructuring charges of $76.5 million in
the fourth quarter of 2001. We spent $32.3 million and $0.9 million of these reserves in 2002 and 2001, respectively, with the remaining reserves to be spent over the next 5 to 7 years as we manage the site’s decommissioning and environmental
issues. These charges included reserves for decontamination, demolition, and other shut down costs of $58.7 million; environmental remediation requirements resulting from the decision to shut down the facility of $54.3 million and our 50 percent
share of costs recorded by Astaris for its obligations associated with the shutdown, or $36.3 million. Offsetting these charges was a reversal in the amount of $34.5 million representing the unspent portion of the reserve recorded in the second
quarter of 2001 for required Consent Decree spending at the Pocatello site to build environmental compliance assets because the decision to shut down the site eliminated the need for further spending. We also recorded as an offset to these charges a
commitment from Astaris to pay us $36.5 million over the next 5 years, reflecting the joint venture’s obligation to contribute to our costs for the shutdown and remediation of the site. We received $3.7 million from Astaris in 2002 related to
this commitment and expect future payments to be funded from Astaris’s savings from the shutdown.

Also included in the $241.7 million of restructuring and other charges related to the U.S.-based phosphorus business was a charge of $12.0
million for other restructuring activities which were not directly related to the shutdown of Pocatello. Included in this charge were restructuring activities related to severance and decommissioning of a coke facility as well as charges related to
the shutdown of two furnaces at Pocatello.

The
decision to shut down Pocatello was consistent with Astaris’s plan to shift raw material supply for most products from high cost elemental phosphorus to lower cost PPA. High energy, operating and environmental costs of producing elemental
phosphorus have reinforced the relative cost advantage of PPA. Over time we expected to shift our supply chain to PPA at an annual cost savings of approximately $25 million to Astaris. In addition, Astaris was able to avoid estimated future costs of
$9.0 million per year associated with operating the environmental compliance assets related to the Consent Decree. The decision to shut down Pocatello in the fourth quarter of 2001 has allowed us to avoid spending of $34.5 million for the remaining
capital costs associated with completing the construction of environmental compliance assets and any start-up costs for this plant, which could have been significant. Further, there also had been a concern that environmental compliance costs could
escalate in future years and add further costs. In addition, estimated future costs at Astaris were expected to include a need to refurbish furnaces at Pocatello in 2004 at an estimated cost of $10.0 million.

In 2001 we recorded $12.5 million of severance and other costs
related to our Agricultural Products segment as a result of our strategic refocusing on key geographic markets and crops and the realignment of our R&D resources to our core strength in insecticides. The majority of the spending related to these
charges occurred in 2002. These charges will result in future savings in both selling and administrative expenses and research and development costs. The annualized savings from these restructurings were approximately $20.0 million. There were 163
severances related to these charges, the majority of which occurred in 2002.

Of the remaining 2001 restructuring and other charges of $20.0 million, approximately $17.5 million related to corporate reorganization costs due to the spin-off of Technologies with remaining charges
of $2.5 million related to restructuring in Specialty Chemicals. The majority of the spending associated with these charges occurred in 2001 and in the first half of 2002. The benefit of the restructuring and other charges from our corporate
reorganization and spin-off are not subject to reasonable estimation. The benefits were directly related to improving stockholder value through creating a focused chemical company. There were approximately 45 severances related to these charges, the
majority occurring in 2001.

Net Interest
expense

in 2002 was $71.6 million compared to $58.3 million in 2001. The increase in interest expense can largely be attributed to higher average debt levels and higher interest rates from our 2002


refinancing. (See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statement included in this Form 10-K
for further details on the refinancing and its effects on our results.)

Provision/benefit for income taxes.

We recorded an income tax provision of $17.4 million in 2002 compared to a benefit of $166.6 million in 2001 resulting in effective tax rates of 20 percent and 35 percent,
respectively. The 2001 tax benefit is a direct result of the significant restructuring and other charges and impairments recorded in 2001. The differences between the effective tax rates for these periods and the statutory U.S. Federal income taxes
rate relate primarily to differing foreign tax rates, depletion, the impairment of certain assets, foreign sales corporation benefits and incremental state taxes.

Discontinued Operations

. We recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $5.3 million ($3.3 million
after tax) in 2002 for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance. (See “Environmental Obligations” below and Note 11 to our consolidated financial
statement included in this Form 10-K for further details.)

We recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $42.5 million ($30.5 million after tax) in 2001. Included in this amount are earnings of Technologies, including interest expense of $11.2 million, which was allocated to
discontinued operations in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Statement No. 30 (“APB 30”) and later relevant accounting guidance, costs related to the spin-off and an additional income tax provision related to the reorganization
of our worldwide entities in anticipation of the separation of Technologies from FMC. In addition, we recorded a charge of $18.0 million for updated estimates of environmental remediation costs related to our other discontinued businesses.

Net income/loss.

We recorded net income
of $65.8 million in 2002 compared to a net loss of $337.7 million for 2001. This variance reflects $323.1 million of asset impairments and $280.4 million of restructuring and other charges recorded in 2001. Net income in 2002 compared to 2001,
excluding asset impairments and restructuring and other charges, was lower due to lower sales in Agricultural Products and Industrial Chemicals, somewhat offset at the earnings level by lower costs through savings from our recent restructuring
activities. We expect net income to be lower in 2003 compared to 2002 mostly due to increased interest expense as a result of our recent refinancing and poorer performance from Astaris in a difficult phosphorus market (see “Liquidity and
Capital Resources.”)

Other Financial Data

Capital Expenditures

totaled $83.9
million in 2002 compared to $145.6 million in 2001. Lower capital expenditures are the result of the lack of requirements for capital expansions and our continued focus on essential value-creating projects. Also reducing capital expenditures was the
lack of spending related to environmental assets at Pocatello. The need for continued spending on these environmental assets was eliminated in the fourth quarter of 2001 with the shutdown of Pocatello.

The following are line items from our segment profit and loss
statement used to reconcile segment-operating profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (see Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included
in this Form 10-K).

Corporate expenses

were $35.6 million in 2002 and $36.3 million in 2001. Corporate expense represents shared costs that cannot be reasonably allocated among the segments.

Other income and expense, net

is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments and pension income or expense. Net other loss
for the year was $0.4 million compared to a net other loss of $1.6 million in 2001. This variance is largely attributable to a LIFO reserve adjustment offset by additional pension and postretirement expenses.

Segment Results—2002 compared to 2001

Segment operating profit is presented before taxes, asset
impairments, restructuring and other charges, interest expense, net and other income and expense, net. Information about how each of these items relates to our


businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included
in this Form 10-K.

Agricultural Products

Agricultural Products revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2002 was $615.1 million, down 6 percent, compared to $653.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Herbicide sales decreased to $135.0 million in 2002 compared to $163.6 million in 2001 mainly due to a planned reduction in
sulfentrazone sales, as we shift our focus from soybeans to higher value crops, and poor weather conditions in North America. Insecticide sales were down slightly at $480.1 million in 2002 compared to $489.5 million in 2001 mostly due to weaker
insecticide demand in Asia from drought conditions in Australia and channel inventory reductions, somewhat offset by the development of new applications, so-called “new labels,” and higher pest infestation levels on cotton in North
America. A stronger demand and new applications in our non-agricultural markets such as turf ornamental and household pests also favorably affected sales in 2002.

Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $69.5 million compared to $72.8 million in the prior year.
Lower herbicide sales and the absence of a $20.0 million profit protection payment from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (“DuPont”) were more than offset by lower selling, administrative and research costs. (See Agricultural Products
under “Segment Results—2001 compared to 2000.”)

Earnings also reflect Agricultural Products’ continuing strategic refocusing on key geographic markets and crops and to realign our R&D resources to our core strengths in insecticides. Related to these refocusing efforts
were restructuring charges in both 2002 and 2001. In 2002 we recorded $4.7 million of restructuring charges for the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in Baltimore and to implement our new distribution strategy in Europe. In the
fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a $12.5 million charge to eliminate all herbicide discovery research as well to reduce our direct sales and support staff to align resources to key geographic markets and crops. Restructuring charges are not
included in the results of our business segments. See Restructuring and other charges under “Results of Operations—December 31, 2002 compare to December 31, 2001” for further details.

We believe our Agricultural Products segment will continue to
show improvement in 2003 through new labels, sales growth from global alliances, continued cost savings and our refocus strategy.

Specialty Chemicals

Specialty Chemicals’ revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $488.2 million, up 3 percent from $472.0 million in 2002.
BioPolymer revenue increased to $355.2 million from $341.2 million in 2001 reflecting a stronger pharmaceutical demand for microcrystalline cellulose, for its use in binders, and steady demand for carrageenan and microcrystalline cellulose in the
food ingredients market. Partially offsetting increased revenue were lower alginate sales due to weaker industrial markets and an unfavorable carrageenan mix in food ingredients. In lithium, revenue performance was $133.0 million in 2002 compared to
$130.8 million in 2001. A stronger organolithium performance in the pharmaceutical and specialty polymer markets and increased demand for energy storage materials for both rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries were offset by lower exports of
lithium salts to Japan, due to a weaker economy, and the absence of a sale into the pharmaceutical markets which occurred the fourth quarter of 2001.

Earnings of $89.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 were 3 percent higher compared to $87.5 million for 2001. Higher earnings
can be attributed to higher sales from overall BioPolymer growth, a decrease in manufacturing costs in lithium, due largely to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, and the absence of a $4.2 million ($2.8 million after tax) charge from the required
change in accounting for amortization related to goodwill. Specialty Chemicals’ goodwill was the direct result of BioPolymer’s 1999 acquisition of Pronova Biopolymer AS. Lithium’s earnings were also favorably impacted by higher
butyllithium sales. In addition, the large pharmaceutical sale in lithium, discussed above, delivered a high margin sale in 2001 that was not repeated in 2002.


During 2002, our BioPolymer business experienced profit pressures within the industrial
markets it serves principally with its alginate product line. As a result, in 2002 we initiated a restructuring to reduce headcount and streamline production costs. We believe that this action will further focus BioPolymer’s commercial efforts
on core, high value markets, including pharmaceutical formulation, food ingredients and personal care. We will focus our efforts on improving alginates profitability in 2003 by concentrating on higher value markets.

Industrial Chemicals

Industrial Chemicals’ revenue was $753.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002, down 8 percent, compared to $822.0 million in 2001. Alkali revenue decreased to $368.0 million in 2002 from $402.5 million in 2001 due to lower overall volumes, lower soda ash export prices and the first quarter 2002
sale of our sodium cyanide business. A portion of the decline in soda ash revenues is attributable to the substitution by some of our industrial customers of caustic soda for soda ash, which occurs when caustic prices decline substantially as they
did in the first quarter of 2002. Furthermore, we experienced lower international sales volumes through the American Natural Soda Ash Association (“ANSAC”), a foreign sales association for U.S. soda ash. Foret saw a decrease in revenue to
$222.5 million in the current year compared to $243.8 million in 2001 reflecting lower phosphate sales, due in part to the loss of a major European detergent customer and generally lower volumes and lower prices throughout its product lines.
Somewhat offsetting decreased revenue at Foret was the favorable translation effect of a stronger euro. Peroxygens (hydrogen peroxide and active oxidants) revenue decreased to $162.9 million in 2002 from $175.7 million in 2001 due to generally lower
selling prices and lower persulfate volumes, reflecting a depressed printed circuit board market. Increased hydrogen peroxide volumes in non-pulp markets along with stronger sales into the pulp markets in the second half of 2002, somewhat offset
lower average selling prices and lower persulfate volumes.

Overall we have maintained earnings levels recording $71.6 million of earnings in 2002 compared to $72.6 in the prior year. Relatively flat earnings on lower sales reflected lower material costs, significant cost savings from our
2002 and 2001 restructuring efforts and lower operating costs related to reduced environmental compliance spending at Pocatello.

Reacting to market weakness in Industrial Chemicals in 2002 we recorded restructuring charges of $12.4 million to improve our cost
position through reorganization changes and mothballing significant parts of our Granger caustic facility and Spring Hill, West Virginia hydrogen peroxide facility. During 2001 we recorded significant charges to impair and subsequently restructure
our U.S.-based phosphorus chemicals business. Total charges for 2001 included an impairment charge of $224.2 million and restructuring and other charges of $247.9 million. Segment earnings do not include these charges. Asset impairments and
restructuring and other charges are not included in our business segment results. See

Asset Impairments

and

Restructuring and other charges

above and Notes 5 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

The restructuring of our U.S.-based phosphorus
chemicals business in late 2001 has allowed us to continue to improve our cost structure and competitive position as we move away from the production and sourcing of elemental phosphorus. Our U.S.-based phosphorus chemicals business’s cost
position should continue to improve as its PPA production increases. The shutdown of Pocatello also allowed FMC to eliminate capital spending on the environmental projects in 2002 and avoid significant start-up and certain on-going operating costs
for environmental compliance issues at the site. The restructuring activities in 2002 should improve our cost and competitive position in hydrogen peroxide from the mothballing at Spring Hill.

Lower joint venture earnings at Astaris and lower volumes and
price throughout the segment offset the cost savings from our restructuring activities. Lower earnings from Astaris were due to a 8 percent decrease in sales to $445.7 million in 2002 from $486.2 million in the prior year. A decreased benefit from
the former power resale contract with Idaho Power and higher than expected startup costs at Astaris’s PPA plant were somewhat offset by lower sourcing costs. The total resale power benefit to Astaris in 2002 was approximately $12 million
compared to approximately $34 million in 2001. This benefit will not continue in 2003.

We generally foresee minimal improvement in economic and competitive conditions within Industrial Chemicals in 2003. Because of a deterioration at Astaris resulting from increased competitive rivalry
at Astaris


and the lack of any benefit from the power resale we expect that equity losses from this joint venture will offset the anticipated improved
profit performance of other products in our Industrial Chemicals segment in 2003. Furthermore, we expect to make keepwell payments based on Astaris’s 2003 performance.

Results of Operations—2001 compared to 2000

Revenue

was $1,943.0 million in 2001, down 5 percent from $2,050.3 million in 2000 reflecting weaker
demand from the industrial markets served by our Industrial Chemicals business segment and lower sulfentrazone sales in our Agricultural Products business segment.

Asset impairments

totaled $323.1 million ($233.8 million after tax) for 2001 compared to $10.1 million
($6.2 million after tax) in 2000.

Industrial
Chemicals recorded an impairment charge of $224.2 million in 2001. A charge of $12.3 million was for the impairment of assets in our sodium cyanide operations and $211.9 million was for the impairment of our U.S.-based phosphorus business.

We recorded an impairment charge of $98.9
million related to our Specialty Chemicals segment’s lithium operations in Argentina. We established this operation, which includes a lithium mine and processing facilities, approximately five years ago in a remote area of the Andes Mountains.
See

Asset Impairments

under “Results of Operations—2002 compared to 2001” above for further details related to these charges.

During 2000, we recorded asset impairments of $10.1 million ($6.2 million after tax). Impairments of $9.0 million were recognized because
of the formation of Astaris, including the write-down of certain phosphorus assets retained by our company and the accrual of costs related to our planned closure of two phosphorus facilities. Other asset impairments were due to the impact of
underlying changes within the Specialty Chemicals segment.

Restructuring and other charges.

A change in market conditions and in our corporate strategy resulted in restructuring and other charges of $280.4 million ($172.1 million after tax) in 2001. A charge of
$35.2 million ($21.7 million after tax) was recorded in 2000.

Industrial Chemicals recorded restructuring and other charges of $247.9 million in 2001. The majority of this charge, $241.7 million, was for restructuring and other charges associated with our U.S.-based phosphorus operation. The
balance of this charge, $6.2 million, was for restructuring activities at several sites including $5.7 million for the mothballing of our Granger soda ash facility.

Also in 2001 we recorded $12.5 million of severance and other costs related to our Agricultural Products
segment, as a result of our decision to refocus certain R&D activities. The majority of the spending related to these charges occurred in 2002.

Of the remaining 2001 charges, $20.0 million related to corporate reorganization costs due to the spin-off of Technologies and to several
minor reorganization costs in our Specialty Chemicals segment. The majority of the spending related to these charges occurred in 2001 and the first half of 2002.

We reduced our workforce by approximately 320 people in connection with our 2001 restructuring activities,
the majority of which occurred within the same year.

During 2000, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $35.2 million ($21.7 million after tax). Restructuring charges of $20.6 million were attributable to the formation of Astaris and the concurrent reorganization of our
Industrial Chemicals sales, marketing and support organizations, the reduction of office space requirements in our Philadelphia chemical headquarters and pension expense related to the separation of phosphorus personnel from our company. In
addition, we recorded $12.5 million of environmental charges from increased cost estimates for ongoing remediation of several phosphorus properties. Other restructuring charges included $2.1 million for other projects. Of the approximately 350
employee severances that were expected to occur through the completion of these programs in 2000, 281 occurred at December 31, 2000 while the remainder occurred in 2001.


Interest
expense, net

in 2001 was $58.3 million compared to $61.8 million in 2000. The decrease in net interest expense in 2001 was primarily the result of lower average debt levels during the year.

Income/loss from continuing operations

was a loss of
$306.3 million in 2001 compared to income of $125.6 million in 2000. Most of the decline can be attributed to asset impairments and restructuring and other charges of $603.5 million ($405.9 million after tax) in 2001 compared to charges of $45.3
million ($27.9 million after tax) in 2000. Also contributing to the decline were poor economic conditions affecting the chemical industry worldwide.

Provision/benefit for income taxes.

We recorded an income tax benefit of $166.6 million in 2001 resulting in
an effective tax rate of 35.2 percent compared to income tax expense of $33.0 million and an effective tax rate of 20.8 percent in 2000.

Discontinued operations.

We recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $42.5 million ($30.5 million
after tax) in 2001. Included in this amount is a loss from Technologies of $19.6 million and a charge of $18.0 million for updated estimates of environmental remediation costs related to our other discontinued businesses.

During 2000, we recorded a loss from discontinued operations
of $17.7 million ($15.0 million after tax). Of this amount, $64.0 million were from the earnings of the spun-off Technologies offset by an $80.0 million loss for a settlement of litigation related to our discontinued Defense Systems business.

Net
income/loss.

We recorded a net loss of $337.7 million for 2001 compared to net income of $110.6 million in 2000. This variance reflects the effect of significant asset impairments and restructuring and other charges
recorded in 2001.

Other Financial Data

Capital expenditures

were $145.6 million in 2001
compared to $197.3 million in 2000. Decreased capital expenditures in 2001 reflected lower spending related to environmental assets at Pocatello. The need for these environmental assets was eliminated in the fourth quarter of 2001 with the shutdown
of Pocatello.

The following are line items from
our segment profit and loss statement used to reconcile segment-operating profit to income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (see Note 18 to our consolidated financial
statements included in this Form 10-K).

Corporate expenses

were $36.3 million in 2001 and $36.2 million in 2000. Corporate expense represents shared costs of the segments that cannot be reasonably allocated.

Other income and expense, net

is comprised primarily of
LIFO inventory adjustments and pension income or expense. Net other expense for the year was $1.6 million compared to net other income of $9.6 million in 2000. This variance is largely attributable to increased pension costs and lower amortization
of a deferred pension asset.

Segment Results—2001
compared to 2000

Segment operating profit
is presented before income taxes, asset impairments, restructuring and other charges, interest expense, net and other income and expense, net. Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by
segment are discussed below and in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

Agricultural Products

Agricultural Products revenue decreased to $653.1 million in 2001 from $664.7 million in 2000. Agricultural Products segment operating
profit declined to $72.8 million, down 17 percent from 2000.

Herbicides revenue decreased 7 percent to $163.6 million in 2001 compared to $175.9 million in 2000 reflecting the lack of sulfentrazone sales to DuPont in 2001. Herbicide sales were down reflecting these lower sulfentrazone sales;
however, earnings in 2001 included a one-time, profit protection payment from DuPont of $20 million (see below). Excluding this payment, segment operating profit decreased 40 percent in 2001. Total


sulfentrazone sales to DuPont were $16.2 million in 2000. Insecticide revenue totaled $489.5 million in 2001 compared to $488.8 million in
2000. The insecticide revenue decrease was mostly due to weakness in Asian and Latin American markets.

In 1998 we entered into an exclusive agreement with DuPont to provide them sulfentrazone in North America for use on soybeans. However,
the sale of formulated products incorporating sulfentrazone did not reach expectations and the contract purchases were cancelled in 2001. DuPont no longer has exclusive rights to the use of sulfentrazone on soybeans in North America. We began
developing new markets in 2001, expanding our sulfentrazone sales, including sales into the North America soybean market. We believe that we have recovered approximately one third of the sulfentrazone volumes lost from the absence of DuPont’s
purchases.

During the fourth quarter of 2001,
Agricultural Products began a restructuring of its operations to focus on key markets and products. A restructuring charge of $12.5 million ($7.8 million after tax) was taken in 2001 to support these plans.

Specialty Chemicals

Specialty Chemicals revenue was $472.0 million in 2001, down
from $488.8 million in 2000 due to lower revenue in both BioPolymer and lithium. Specialty Chemicals segment operating profit declined to $87.5 million, or 5 percent from $92.4 million in the prior year. BioPolymer revenue decreased to $341.2
million in 2001 compared to $350.8 million in 2000 due to a combination of a weaker euro, weaker demand from customer inventory corrections and lower selling prices for alginates and carrageenan in specialty markets. Lithium revenue decreased to
$130.8 million in 2001 from $138.0 million in 2000 resulting from our strategic exit from the commodity lithium carbonate market and slower industrial markets, particularly in Europe.

Industrial Chemicals

Industrial Chemicals revenue decreased to $822.0 million in 2001, down 9 percent compared to $905.6 million
in 2000. Industrial Chemicals’ segment operating profit declined by 36.6 percent to $72.6 million in 2001 from $114.5 million in 2000.

Alkali revenue was relatively flat in 2001 at $402.5 million compared to $402.0 million in the prior year. Peroxygens revenue (hydrogen
peroxide and active oxidants) of $175.7 million in 2001 compared to $189.2 million in 2000 was down despite the price increases initiated in late 2000 and the application of an energy surcharge in early 2001. Foret, our Spanish operation, recorded
revenue of $243.8 million compared to $235.2 million in 2000 reflecting strong phosphate and zeolite markets.

The 2001 and 2000 revenue comparison was further affected by the inclusion of sales from our U.S.-based phosphorus chemicals business in
the first three months of 2000, which totaled $79.2 million. Subsequent to March of 2000, U.S. phosphorus chemical sales have been deconsolidated and reflected through our equity investment in Astaris.

Lower operating profit reflected economic weakness during the
year, increased power costs, consent decree spending at Pocatello and the PPA plant startup costs.

During 2001 we continued to execute our business plan for our Industrial Chemicals business segment which included significant
restructuring activities as well as our continued review of long-term assets for impairment. The goal was to mitigate the future effects of the anticipated economic slowdown as well as prepare the business for long-term growth while maximizing cash
generation. Asset impairments totaled $224.2 million and restructuring and other charges related to these activities totaled $247.9 million in 2001. Restructuring and other charges included $96.5 million for restructuring activities in our
U.S.-based phosphorus chemicals and cyanide businesses and $151.4 million of other charges related to our U.S.-based phosphorus chemicals business.

New Accounting Standards Adopted

On January 1, 2002 we adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” For further discussion of the effect of this
recently adopted standard see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.


On January 1,
2002, we adopted SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” This statement supersedes SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of,” and establishes a single accounting model, based on the framework established in SFAS No. 121, for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale. The Statement retains most of the requirements of SFAS No. 121 related to the recognition of
the impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used. There was no impact of adopting SFAS No. 144 in 2002.

In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 145 “Rescission of FASB Statements Nos. 4,
44 and 64, Amendment of FASB No. 14, and Technical Corrections.” The Statement rescinds or amends a number of existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under
changed conditions. In 2002, with the retirement of our Meridian Gold debentures, we elected to adopt SFAS No. 145 early and recorded a $3.1 million loss ($1.9 million after tax) in 2002 related to the early retirement of these debentures in
selling, general and administrative expenses in accordance with SFAS No. 145.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others”
(“FIN 45”). FIN 45 requires that the guarantor recognize, at the inception of certain guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing such a guarantee. FIN 45 also requires additional disclosure about the
guarantor’s obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 and
the disclosure requirements are effective after December 15, 2002, and are included in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition
and Disclosure—An amendment of FASB Statement No. 123” (“SFAS No. 148”). This statement amends SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the
effect of the method used on reported results. The transition and annual disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS
No. 148 regarding disclosure requirements for condensed consolidated financial statements for interim periods. We have determined that our company will not make the voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation.

On January 1, 2001, we
implemented SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively, the “Statement”). The Statement required our company to recognize all
derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, with changes in the fair value of derivative instruments to be recorded in current earnings or deferred in other comprehensive income, depending on the type of hedging transaction and
whether a derivative is designated as an effective hedge. In accordance with the provisions of the Statement, we recorded a first quarter 2001 loss from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $0.9 million after-tax in the
consolidated statement of earnings, and a deferred gain of $16.4 million after-tax in accumulated other comprehensive loss.

New Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” SFAS No. 143 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. We expect to adopt the provisions of this pronouncement in 2003, as required. The effects of adoption,
if any, are currently being evaluated.


In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with
Exit or Disposal Activities.” This standard addresses the accounting and reporting for costs of so-called “exit activities” (including restructuring) and for the disposal of long-lived assets. The standard changes some of the criteria
for recognizing a liability for these activities. It is effective beginning in 2003 with the liability recognition criteria under the standard applied prospectively. We will adopt SFAS No. 146 beginning in 2003 and are evaluating the potential
impact of adoption on our accounting policies regarding exit and disposal activities.

Environmental Obligations

Our company, like other industrial manufacturers, is involved with a variety of environmental matters in the ordinary course of conducting its business and is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws. We believe
strongly that we have a responsibility to protect the environment, public health and employee safety. This responsibility includes cooperating with other parties to resolve issues created by past and present handling of wastes.

When issues arise, including notices from the EPA or other
government agencies identifying our company as a PRP, our environmental remediation management assesses and manages the issues. When necessary, we use multifunctional teams composed of environmental, legal, financial and communications personnel to
ensure that our actions are consistent with our responsibilities to the environment and public health, as well as to our employees and shareholders.

We provided environmental provisions totaling $10.2 million in 2002. This included charges related to environmental sites of discontinued
businesses and continuing operating sights. In 2001 we provided $68.8 million of environmental provisions related to operating and discontinued sites, of which $47.4 million was for additional remediation related to the shutdown of Pocatello. In the
second quarter of 2000, we provided environmental provisions totaling $12.5 million related to ongoing remediation of several phosphorus properties.

Additional information regarding our environmental accounting policies and environmental liabilities is included in “Application of
Critical Accounting Policies” and Notes 1 and 11, respectively to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Information regarding environmental obligations associated with our discontinued operations is included in Note
11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Estimates of 2002 environmental spending are included in “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During 2002, we strengthened our liquidity position and obtained adequate capital resources for planned
business operations by completing a series of financing transactions.

On June 12, 2002, we issued 3.25 million shares of common stock and used the net proceeds of $101.3 million to reduce amounts borrowed under our $240.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. This was the first
step in a refinancing plan in which we intended subsequently to issue unsecured bonds and renew and extend the maturity of our $240.0 million revolving credit facility.

In June 2003, subsequent to the completion of our common stock offering, Moody’s lowered its rating of
our long-term debt from Baa3 to Ba1. Moody’s rating of Baa3 is the tenth level from the top of its ratings scale comprised of twenty long-term debt ratings. Its downgrade of our long-term debt rating by one level to Ba1, or the eleventh of
twenty ratings, was from its lowest investment-grade rating to the highest level of the non-investment-grade category. Moody’s also lowered its rating of our short-term debt from P-3 to NP, the fourth level from the top of its five-level
short-term debt ratings scale. Subsequent to these actions by Moody’s, we ceased offerings under our commercial paper program and repaid maturities through borrowings under our $240.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Also
resulting from the downgrade in our credit ratings, availability decreased under our former accounts receivable securitization program, which was offset by increased borrowings under our $240.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The
ratings downgrades resulted in several changes to our refinancing plan.


On October 21,
2002, we completed a refinancing in which we issued $355.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.25 percent senior secured notes due 2009 (the “Notes”) at a discount of $4.4 million. Simultaneously, we entered into a new $500.0 million
senior secured credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for a $250.0 million revolving credit facility and a $250.0 million term loan facility, and obtained a $40.0 million supplemental secured standby letter of credit
facility (the “Supplemental Letter of Credit Facility” and together with the Credit Agreement, the “Credit Facilities”). On October 21, 2002 we obtained $244.9 million, net of discounts, from the Credit Agreement’s term loan
facility. The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes and borrowings under the Credit Agreement totaling $595.5 million were used to:

•

Fund $260.0 million into a debt reserve account (the “Debt Reserve Account”), included in restricted cash, to redeem $99.5 million in aggregate principal
amount of our 7.125 percent medium-term notes due November 2002 and $160.5 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.375 percent debentures due in September 2003.

•

Repay all borrowings under and terminate our former $240.0 revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility, which had outstanding amounts
of $136.1 million and $65.0 million, respectively, both of which were terminated on October 21, 2002;

•

Fund into a restricted cash account (the “Restricted Cash Collateral Account”), included in restricted cash, $130.8 million to refinance and replace with
cash collateral certain surety bonds and letters of credit supporting self-insurance programs, environmental obligations and future business commitments and provide $43.4 million of cash to collateralize letters of credit supporting variable rate
industrial and pollution control revenue bonds; and

•

Pay fees and expenses of approximately $21 million, which included bank fees, and various other costs.

The Supplemental Letter of Credit Facility was utilized in
connection with our refinancing to provide letters of credit totaling $39.9 million in support of self-insurance programs and environmental obligations.

Among other restrictions, the Credit Facilities contain financial covenants related to leverage (measured as the ratio of adjusted
earnings to debt), interest coverage (measured as the ratio of interest expense to adjusted earnings), consolidated net worth and capital spending. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2002. See Note 10 of our consolidated
financial statements included in this Form 10-K for a summary of the terms for both the Notes and the new Credit Facilities.

Prior to the completion of our refinancing, we obtained funding through an accounts receivable securitization program. We sold
receivables, without recourse, through our wholly owned bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, FMC Funding Corporation, which then sold the receivables to an unrelated finance company. The sold receivables and repurchase obligations related to the
securitization program were not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The accounting for our former accounts receivable securitization program was in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 140 “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing
of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities.” The transfer of accounts receivable qualified as a sale under the provisions of SFAS No. 140 as a result of our surrender of control of these financial assets, without recourse, in
exchange for cash. Accordingly, we recorded a reduction of accounts receivable equal to the total amount of cash received from FMC Funding Corporation in connection with the transaction. The downgrade of our long-term debt rating by Moody’s in
June 2002 reduced the funds available to us from this program. Funds from the accounts receivable securitization totaled $79.0 million at December 31, 2001. On October 21, 2002 we terminated our accounts receivable securitization program with
proceeds from our new financing.

We maintained a
$240.0 million committed revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in December 2002. The total amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2001 was $68.0 million. In January 2002, we obtained a supplemental $50.0 million
committed credit facility to meet short-term seasonal financing needs. In August 2002, this supplemental credit facility was amended to reduce its availability to $25.0 million and to extend its maturity to October 31, 2002. Upon completion of our
refinancing we repaid


outstanding borrowings of $136.1 million and terminated the $240.0 million revolving credit facility with the proceeds from our refinancing.
We also terminated the supplemental credit facility, under which there were no outstanding borrowings when terminated.

At December 31, 2002, we had total debt of $1,267.0 million compared to debt of $923.5 million as of December 31, 2001. This included
$64.3 million of short-term debt at December 31, 2002, comprised almost entirely of foreign borrowings, compared to $136.5 million at December 31, 2001. There were no revolving credit borrowings outstanding under our new Credit Agreement at December
31, 2002.

During 2002 significant events
affecting our liquidity included:

Spending
against restructuring and other reserves of $91.8 million, including paying $32.3 million for the shutdown and remediation our Pocatello plant; paying $131.6 million for scheduled maturities and for redemptions of long-term debt; paying $32.5
million to redeem all of the outstanding 6.75 percent exchangeable senior subordinated debentures; redeeming $17.1 million of our 6.375 percent debentures due September 2003 and issuing 3.25 million shares of common stock with net proceeds of $101.3
million.

Cash and cash equivalents at December
31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 were $89.6 million and $23.4 million, respectively.

Cash provided by operating activities was $136.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to cash required by operating activities of $52.9 million in 2001 and cash provided by operating
activities of $272.4 million in 2000. Historically, cash flows from operating activities have funded a substantial portion of our cash requirements. In 2002 and 2001 cash from operating activities was reduced by the net cash impact of spending
related to our restructuring and other charges. Included in our operating cash activities in 2002 is $63.8 million for spending on restructuring and other activities, including $32.3 million for the shutdown and remediation of Pocatello. The future
spending against restructuring reserves related to the Pocatello shutdown of $53.0 million at December 2002 is expected to continue through 2007 with progressively less spent in each of the future years. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities
decreased significantly in 2002 reflecting lower business activity, including lower inventory, in 2002 than in 2001. Also favorably affecting our 2002 cash provided by operating activities was improved collections of accounts receivable especially
within Agricultural Products, particularly in Latin America.

Cash required by discontinued operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $29.6 million, $111.9 million and $50.1 million, respectively. The majority of the spending for our discontinued operations is
for environmental remediation on discontinued sites and post-employment benefits for former employees of discontinued businesses. In the first quarter of 2001 the company made an $80.0 million payment for the settlement of litigation related to our
discontinued defense systems business.

Cash
required by investing activities was $110.8 million, $169.6 million, and $97.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The majority of this spending related to capital additions to our property, plant and
equipment to maintain operating standards and comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. Also included in investing activities are keepwells to Astaris of $29.6 million and $31.3 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively. A planned
reduction in capital spending in 2002 compared to 2001 contributed to the decline in cash required by investing activities. Additionally, 2001 included approximately $43 million for spending on environmental remediation assets at Pocatello. The
fourth quarter 2001 decision to shut down Pocatello enabled us to curtail this spending. Cash required by investing activities in 2000 was reduced by a net cash distribution by Astaris to FMC of $88.8 million.

Cash provided by financing activities for 2002 of $65.8
million decreased by $271.3 million when compared to cash provided by financing activities of $346.7 million in 2001. Our 2002 financing activities included a net increase in long-term debt of $384.1 million from net proceeds of our refinancing of
$595.5 million. The current year’s activity also reflects $181.2 million paid to redeem long-term debt, a $37.8 million decrease in our vendor


financing and $65.0 million paid to terminate our accounts receivable securitization program in October 2002. This program had an outstanding
balance of $79.0 million at December 31, 2001. Our long-term debt repayments included payments of $10.4 million, $25.0 million and $99.5 million, respectively, in the first, second and fourth quarters of 2002 for scheduled maturities, the redemption
of $17.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.37 percent debentures due September 2003 and several other minor maturities. We also made payments of $32.5 million to redeem all outstanding 6.75 percent exchangeable senior subordinated
debentures. Financing sources included $101.3 million, net of issuance costs, from the issuance of 3.25 million shares of common stock in the second quarter of 2002, which was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our former $240.0 million
revolving credit facility, which was terminated upon the completion of our refinancing in October 2002. Our 2001 financing activities included $430.7 million from the IPO of Technologies, net of contributions to Technologies to support their
operating cash needs.

Commitments and other potential
liquidity needs

Our 2003 cash needs include
operating cash requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled maturities of long-term debt, equity contributions to Astaris, an expected contingent payment due at year-end 2003 related to the acquisition of Tg Soda Ash, environmental spending and
restructuring spending. We plan to meet these liquidity needs through cash generated from operations and borrowings under the new Credit Agreement.

We have provided an agreement to lenders of Astaris under which we have agreed to make equity contributions to Astaris sufficient to make
up one-half of shortfalls in Astaris’s earnings below certain levels. Astaris’s earnings did not meet the agreed levels for 2002 and 2001 and we do not expect that such earnings will meet the levels agreed for 2003. We contributed $29.6
million to Astaris under this arrangement in 2002 and $31.3 million in 2001. We expect our equity contributions to Astaris in 2003 to be between $35 million and $50 million. The proportional amount of Astaris’s indebtedness subject to this
agreement from FMC was approximately $84.0 million at December 31, 2002. In 2002, certain amendments to the agreement under which FMC makes equity contributions to Astaris that were necessary to complete our refinancing were obtained from
Astaris’s lenders.

On June 30, 1999, we
acquired Tg Soda Ash, Inc. from Elf Atochem North America, Inc. for approximately $51.0 million in cash and a contingent payment due at year-end 2003. The contingent payment amount, which will be based on the financial performance of the combined
soda ash operations between 2001 and 2003, cannot currently be determined precisely but is expected to be in the range of $40.0 million to $45.0 million.

Projected 2003 spending also includes approximately $50 million of environmental remediation spending, of which $25 million relates to
Pocatello and $25 million for other operating and discontinued business sites. This spending does not include expected spending of approximately $7 million and $9 million in 2003 and 2004, respectively, on capital projects relating to environmental
control facilities. Also, we expect to spend in the range of approximately $20 million to $25 million annually in 2003 and in 2004 for environmental compliance costs, which are an operating cost of the company and are not covered by established
reserves.

Other commitments that could affect
our liquidity include the following:

In
connection with the spin-off of Technologies, we retained liability for various contingent obligations totaling $289.0 million at December 31, 2001. Contractual releases obtained by FMC have reduced this amount to $14.5 million at December 31, 2002.
We expect this amount to decline further in 2003. Contingent obligations include guarantees of the performance of Technologies under various customer contracts, reimbursements on behalf of Technologies under letters of credit, and guarantees of
indebtedness of Technologies. We have a guaranty agreement from Technologies providing for reimbursement to us if we are ever called upon to satisfy these obligations. Because of our expectation that the underlying obligations will be met and the
existence of the guarantee from Technologies, we believe it is unlikely that we would have to pay any of these contingent obligations.


In the ordinary course of business, we provide credit enhancements to governmental
agencies, insurance companies, and others for our environmental obligations, self-insurance programs and other future business commitments. As part of our refinancing, we funded $130.8 million into a Restricted Cash Collateral Account, to provide
for future cash collateralization of a portion of these obligations. Additionally, we obtained $39.9 million of standby letters of credit under our Supplemental Letter of Credit Facility.

At December 31, 2002 there was $41.0 million principal amount outstanding of variable rate industrial and
pollution control revenue bonds supported by $43.4 million in bank letters of credit. Subsequent to December 31, 2002, as part of our refinancing, we obtained sufficient cash to collateralize, fully, these letters of credit.

We provide parent guarantees to lending institutions providing
credit to our foreign subsidiaries. The outstanding amounts of debt guaranteed were $64.3 million and $68.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002 and 2001.

We provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain Agricultural Products customers in
Brazil for their seasonal borrowing needs. The customers’ obligations to us are largely secured by liens on their crops. The total of these guarantees at December 31, 2002 was $18.2 million compared to $56.0 million at December 31, 2001. We
also provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain Agricultural Products customers in Brazil to support their importation of third-party agricultural products. These guarantees totaled $4.5 million and $10.0 million December 31,
2002 and at December 31, 2001, respectively.

Our
total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next five years and beyond are as follows:

(1)

Before discounts.

(2)

Before recoveries.

(3)

Based on the low end of our estimated range.

(4)

Astaris keepwell payments are based on the low end of our estimated range of possible 2003 keepwell payments.

Dividends

On November 29, 2001, our Board of Directors approved the spin-off of the remaining 83 percent of
Technologies making it an independent publicly traded company. The spin-off qualified as a tax-free distribution to U.S. stockholders. Stockholders of record as of December 31, 2001 received approximately 1.72 shares of common stock of the new
company for every 1.0 share of our stock. Fractional shares were paid in cash to stockholders in lieu of fractional shares on December 31, 2001.

No cash dividends were paid in 2002. No cash dividends were paid in 2001 other than amounts paid in lieu of fractional shares as discussed
above. No cash dividends were paid in 2000. No cash dividends are expected to be paid in 2003.


ITEM
7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize cash flow
exposure to changes in currency and exchange rates through a controlled program of risk management by entering into derivative contracts with major financial institutions.

The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected
changes in market rates and prices. The range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and
prices chosen. The market value foreign currency risk is calculated by us, using a third-party software model which uses standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (spot and forward exchange
rates) as of the valuation date. The market value energy price risk is calculated by a third party.

At December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, our net financial instrument position was a net liability of $5.7 million and $25.9 million,
respectively. The change in the net financial instrument position was due to improved positions in our natural gas forward contracts due to increased energy prices somewhat offset by favorable foreign currency forward contracts against a
strengthening euro.

Interest Rate Risk

Our debt portfolio at December 31, 2002 is composed of 74
percent fixed-rate debt and 26 percent variable-rate debt. The largest portion of our variable rate debt is from our $250.0 million term loan facility which was outstanding for approximately two months in 2002. The majority of our debt portfolio at
December 31, 2001 was composed of fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the variable-rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest
incurred and cash flows, but does not impact the net financial instrument position.

Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not significantly affect net income in
either year.

Commodity Price Risk

Energy costs are approximately 8 percent of our cost of sales
and services. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of natural gas. Below is a sensitivity analysis reflecting the effect of changing energy prices.

The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10 percent
change in natural gas prices from their levels at December 31, 2002 and December 31 2001 with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. A 10 percent increase in New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMX”) prices would result
in a decrease of $6.2 million in the net liability position of the relevant financial instruments into a net asset position at December 31, 2002 and decrease of $5.2 million in the net liability position of the relevant financial instruments at
December 31, 2001. A 10 percent decrease in NYMX prices would result in increases of $4.3 million and $7.5 million in the net liability position of the relevant financial instruments at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The primary currencies for which we have exchange rate
exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the euro, the euro versus the Norwegian krone, the U.S. dollar versus the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar versus the Brazilian real. Foreign currency debt and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in
countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Below is a sensitivity analysis reflecting the effect of
changing foreign currency rates.

The sensitivity
analysis assumes an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. A 10 percent strengthening of
hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in a increase of $8.6 million in the net liability position and a decrease of $7.5 million in the net asset position into a net liability of the relevant financial instruments at
December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. A 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in a decrease of $8.2 million in the net liability position into a net asset position of the relevant
financial instruments at December 31, 2002 and an increase of $8.0 million in the net asset position of the relevant financial instruments at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001.

FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1    PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Nature of operations

.    FMC
Corporation (“FMC” or “the company”) is a diversified chemical company serving agricultural, industrial and consumer markets globally with innovative solutions, applications and quality products. FMC increased its focus on the
chemical industry in 2001 by spinning off its non-chemical business segments, Energy Systems and Food and Transportation Systems, into a separately owned public company, FMC Technologies, Inc. (“Technologies”) (Note 2). The company
operates in three business segments: Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals. Agricultural Products provides crop protection and pest control products for worldwide markets. Specialty Chemicals includes food ingredients
that are used to enhance structure, texture and taste; pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use; and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis and energy storage. Industrial Chemicals encompasses a wide range of inorganic
materials in which FMC possesses market and technology leadership, including soda ash, phosphorus and peroxygens (hydrogen peroxide and active oxidants) in both North America and in Europe through FMC’s subsidiary, FMC Foret, S.A
(“Foret”).

Consolidation

.    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FMC and all significant majority-owned subsidiaries and ventures. All material intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation.

Basis of
presentation

.    In 2001 the company spun off a significant portion of its business into Technologies, a separately-owned public company (Note 2). The spin-off, which was completed on December 31, 2001 as a tax-free dividend,
was accounted for in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Statement No. 30 (“APB 30”). The Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for all periods presented reflect Technologies as a discontinued
operation.

Interest
expense

.    As a result of the spin-off of Technologies, interest expense, net, for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, has been allocated to discontinued operations based on net assets in accordance with APB 30 and
later relevant accounting guidance. The amount of net interest expense allocated to discontinued operations was $6.8 million (net of an income tax benefit of $4.4 million) and $18.8 million (net of an income tax benefit of $12.1 million) for 2001
and 2000, respectively.

Use of
estimates

.    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results are likely to differ from
those estimates, but management does not believe such differences will materially affect the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Investments

.    Investments in companies in which FMC’s ownership interest is
50 percent or less and in which FMC exercises significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method. In addition majority owned investments in which FMC’s control is restricted or temporary in
nature also are accounted for using this method. All other investments are carried at their fair values or at cost, as appropriate.

Cash equivalents and restricted cash

.    The company considers investments in all liquid debt instruments with
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. For restricted cash (Note 10) the carrying value approximates fair value.


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Accounts receivable

.    Through October of 2002, the company sold trade receivables without recourse through its wholly owned bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, FMC Funding Corporation. The subsidiary then sold
the receivables to a securitization company under an accounts receivable financing facility on an ongoing basis. The accounting for FMC’s former accounts receivable securitization program was in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 140
“Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities.” The transfer of accounts receivable qualified as a sale under the provisions of SFAS No. 140 as a result of FMC’s surrender of control of
these financial assets, without recourse, in exchange for cash. Accordingly, the company recorded a reduction of accounts receivable equal to the total amount of cash received from FMC Funding Corporation in connection with the transaction. These
transactions resulted in a reduction of accounts receivable of $79.0 million at December 31, 2001. The agreement for the sale of accounts receivable provided for continuation of the program on a revolving basis through November 2002. Upon the
completion of its refinancing on October 21, 2002 (Note 10) the company terminated its account receivable securitization program. The company accounted for the sale of receivables in accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities,” which the company adopted in 2001.

Inventories

.    Inventories are
stated at the lower of cost or market value. Inventory costs include those costs directly attributable to products before sale, including all manufacturing overhead but excluding distribution costs. All domestic inventories, excluding materials and
supplies, are determined on a last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) basis (Note 7).

Property, plant and equipment

.    Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest, are recorded at cost. Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is
provided principally on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (land improvements—20 years, buildings—20 to 50 years, and machinery and equipment—3 to 18 years). Gains and losses are reflected in income
upon sale or retirement of assets. Expenditures that extend the useful lives of property, plant and equipment or increase productivity are capitalized. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred through operating expense.

Asset
impairments

.    As of January 1, 2002 the company reviews the recovery of the net book value of long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected
future cash flows are less than the net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the net book value exceeds the fair value of the asset.

Restructuring and other charges

.    Management continually performs strategic
reviews and assesses the return on the company’s businesses. This sometimes results in a plan to restructure the operations of a business. When a plan is final, an accrual for severance and other contractual obligations is recorded. In 2003,
the company will be reviewing its policy for accounting for restructuring charges to ensure compliance with SFAS No. 146 “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.”

Capitalized interest

.    Interest
costs of $7.1 million in 2002 ($9.4 million in 2001 and $9.0 million in 2000) associated with the construction of certain long-lived assets have been capitalized as part of the cost of those assets and are being amortized over the assets’
estimated useful lives.

Deferred costs and
other assets

.    Unamortized capitalized software costs totaling $29.2 million and $35.7 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, are components of other assets, which also include bond discounts and other
deferred charges. The company capitalizes the costs of internal use software in accordance


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Statement of Position 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use” (SOP 98-1), which generally permits the capitalization of certain costs incurred to develop or obtain internal use software. Recoverability of deferred software costs is assessed on an ongoing
basis, and write-downs to fair value are recorded as necessary. Capitalized software costs are amortized over expected useful lives ranging from three to ten years.

Goodwill and intangible assets

.    On January 1, 2002 the company adopted SFAS No.
142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” With the adoption of SFAS No 142, goodwill and other indefinite intangible assets (“intangibles”) are no longer subject to amortization, rather they are subject to at least an annual
assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. Prior to January 1, 2002 the company amortized goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (such as trademarks) on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives not to exceed
40 years. In 2002 the company completed the transitional goodwill and indefinite life intangibles impairment tests and the annual test required by SFAS No. 142 and recorded no impairments of its goodwill and indefinite life intangibles based on
these fair value tests. The company tests goodwill for impairment annually using the fair value criteria prescribed by SFAS No. 142. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the net book value, an impairment loss is
recognized equal to an amount by which the net book value exceeds the fair value of assets.

There was no goodwill amortization in 2002. Goodwill amortization was $2.8 million, after tax, or $0.09 per diluted share in 2001 and $2.8 million, after tax or $0.09 per share in 2000. Goodwill at
December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $129.7 million and $113.5 million, respectively. The majority of goodwill is attributed to an acquisition in the Specialty Chemicals segment. There are no other material indefinite life intangibles, other than
goodwill, at December 31, 2002.

The
company’s definite life intangibles totaled $12.1 million as of December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002 these definite life intangibles are allocated among the company’s business segments as follows: $6.4 million in Agricultural Products,
$4.0 million in Specialty Chemicals and $1.7 million in Industrial Chemicals. Definite life intangible assets consist primarily of patents, industry licenses and other intangibles. Amortization was not significant in the years presented.

Revenue
recognition

.    Revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete, which is generally upon transfer of title, which typically occurs upon shipment to the customer. In all cases, the following criteria are in effect
for the recognition of revenue: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Rebates due to customers are provided in the same period that the
related sales are recorded based on the contract terms. Provisions for estimated returns and allowances are recorded at the time of the sale based on historical rates of return as a percentage of sales.

Income taxes

.    Current income
taxes are provided on income reported for financial statement purposes adjusted for transactions that do not enter into the computation of income taxes payable. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Income taxes are not provided for the equity in undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries or affiliates when it is management’s
intention that such earnings will remain invested in those companies, but are provided in the year in which the decision is made to repatriate the earnings.

Foreign currency translation

.    Assets and liabilities of most foreign operations are translated at exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and the foreign operations’ income statements are translated at the


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

monthly exchange rates for the period. For the company’s operations where the local currency is the functional currency translation
gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity until the foreign entity is sold or liquidated. The company did not operate in any highly inflationary countries during 2002,
2001 and 2000. In countries where the local currency is not the functional currency, inventories, property, plant and equipment, and other non-current assets are converted to U.S. dollars at historical exchange rates, and all gains or losses from
conversion are included in net income.

The value
of the U.S. dollar and other currencies in which FMC operates continually fluctuate. The company’s results of operations and financial positions for all the years presented have been affected by such fluctuations. The company enters into
certain foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the financial risk associated with this fluctuation (Note 15). These contracts typically qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133 (see “Derivative financial instruments” below and Note
15). The company does not hedge 100 percent of its currency transactions or monetary assets and liabilities. Net income (loss) for 2002, 2001 and 2000 included aggregate transactional foreign currency gains and losses. These losses of $10.3 million
and $0.1 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and a $4.6 million gain in 2000, excluded gains and losses from the change in fair value related to the settling and ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges and gains (losses) related to the change in
fair value of foreign currency contracts not qualifying as hedges. Other comprehensive income or loss for 2002, 2001 and 2000 included a translation gain of $47.2 million, a translation loss of $12.5 million and a translation loss of $69.8 million,
respectively.

Derivative financial
instruments

.    FMC mitigates certain financial exposures, including currency risk and energy purchase exposures, through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The
company enters into foreign exchange contracts, including forward and purchased option contracts, to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

FMC adopted SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,”
(“SFAS No. 133”) and SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities,” an amendment of SFAS No. 133, on January 1, 2001 (collectively the “Statements”). These Statements
establish accounting and reporting standards that require every derivative instrument to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 133 requires the transition adjustment
resulting from adopting these Statements to be reported in net income or accumulated other comprehensive income, as appropriate, as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Accordingly, on January 1, 2001, the company recorded the
fair value of all outstanding derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The transition adjustment was a $0.9 million after tax loss to earnings and $16.4 million after-tax gain to accumulated other
comprehensive income. The loss was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, as amended, the company recognizes all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
On the date the derivative instrument is entered into, the company generally designates the derivative as a hedge of a forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge) or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset
or liability. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets all the required criteria for a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified into earnings as the underlying
hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedge are recorded immediately in earnings.

For periods prior to 2001, gains and losses on foreign currency hedges of existing assets and liabilities are included in the carrying
amounts of those assets or liabilities and were ultimately recognized in income when those carrying amounts were converted. Gains and losses related to foreign currency hedges of firm commitments also were deferred and included in the basis of the
transaction when it was complete. Gains and


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

losses on unhedged foreign currency transactions are included in income as part of cost of sales or services. Gains and losses on derivative
financial instruments that protect the company from exposure in a particular currency, but do not currently have a designated underlying transaction, are also included in income. If a hedged item matured, was sold, extinguished, or terminated, or
was related to an anticipated transaction that is no longer likely to take place, the derivative financial instrument related to the hedged item was closed out and the related gain or loss is included in income as part of cost of sales or services.
Also, FMC purchased exchange-traded contracts to manage exposure to fluctuating energy prices used in the company’s manufacturing processes. Gains and losses on these contracts are included as adjustments to cost of sales or service when the
contracts are settled.

FMC formally documents
all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes relating all derivatives that are designated cash flow hedges to
specific forecasted transactions. The company also formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. If
it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the company will discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively. The gains and losses
reported for the ineffective portion of its cash flow hedges were minimal for 2002 and 2001.

Cash flows from hedging contract settlements are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same categories as the cash flows from the transactions being hedged.

Treasury stock

.    Shares of common
stock repurchased under the company’s stock repurchase plans are recorded at cost as treasury stock and result in a reduction of stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When the treasury shares are reissued under
FMC’s stock compensation plans, the company uses a first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method for determining cost. The difference between the cost of the shares and the reissuance price is added to or deducted from capital in excess of par
value of common stock. The company discontinued its stock repurchases, except as needed to administer its employee benefit plans.

Earnings or loss per common share (“EPS”)

.    Basic EPS has been computed by dividing net income by
the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS has been computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year plus the weighted
average number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding during the year if potentially dilutive common shares had been issued under the company’s stock compensation plans. In periods such as 2001, when a net loss from
continuing operations has been recorded, basic shares outstanding are used to compute both basic and diluted EPS, as the use of diluted shares would be anti-dilutive. The weighted average numbers of shares outstanding used to calculate the
company’s annual EPS were as follows:

Segment information

.    The company’s determination of its reportable segments based on its strategic business units and the commonalities among the products and services within each segment
corresponds to the manner in which the company’s management reviews and evaluates operating performance.

Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals have been identified as the reportable segments of the company.
Business segment data are included in Note 18. Segment operating profit is defined as


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

total revenue less operating expenses. The following items have been excluded in computing segment operating profit: corporate staff expense,
interest income and expense associated with corporate debt facilities and investments, income taxes, gains (or losses) on divestitures of businesses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, LIFO inventory adjustments, and other income
and expense items. Information about how asset impairments, restructuring and other charges relate to FMC’s businesses at the segment level is discussed in Notes 5 and 6.

Segment assets and liabilities are those assets and liabilities that are recorded and reported by segment
operations. Segment operating capital employed represents segment assets less segment liabilities. Segment assets exclude corporate and other assets, which are principally cash equivalents, LIFO reserves, deferred income tax benefits, eliminations
of intercompany receivables, property and equipment not attributable to a specific segment. Segment liabilities exclude substantially all debt, income taxes, pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities, environmental reserves, restructuring
reserves, deferred gains on sale and leaseback of equipment, fair value of currency contracts, intercompany eliminations, and reserves for discontinued operations.

Geographic segment revenue represents sales by location of the company’s customers. Geographic segment
long-lived assets include investments, net property, plant and equipment, and other non-current assets. Geographic segment data are included in Note 18.

Stock compensation plans

.    The company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure — An amendment of FASB Statement No. 123.” Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the Plan (Note 13).

Environmental obligations

.    The
company provides for environmental-related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. Where the
information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used.

Estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(“EPA”), or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a Record of Decision (“ROD”), or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (“RI/FS”) that
is accepted by FMC and the appropriate government agency or agencies. Estimates are reviewed quarterly by the company’s environmental remediation management, as well as by financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional
information becomes available. The estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental
agencies or private parties.

The company’s
environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and/or study of sites at which the company is alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances. Such costs principally
include, among other items, RI/FS, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. Estimated site
liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites. Total reserves of $223.4 million and
$260.4 million, respectively, before recoveries, were recorded at December 31, 2002 and 2001. In addition, the company has estimated that reasonably possible loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as $80.0 million at December 31,
2002.

Provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named Potentially Responsible Parties (“PRPs”) or other third parties. Such provisions incorporate inflation and are
not discounted to their present values.

In
calculating and evaluating the adequacy of its environmental reserves, the company has taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and
the analogous state laws on all PRPs and has considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other PRPs at each site to the extent possible. The company has also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties
from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of the company’s claims against such parties. Although the company is unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of PRPs and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of
uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site-by-site basis. The company’s liability includes management’s
best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before its consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. The company believes that any recorded recoveries related to PRPs are realizable in all material respects. Recoveries are
recorded in “Environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued.”

Recently adopted accounting standards

.    On January 1, 2002 the company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” For further discussion of the
effect of this recently adopted standard see “Goodwill and intangible assets” above.

On January 1, 2002, the company adopted SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” This statement supersedes SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,” and establishes a single accounting model, based on the framework established in SFAS No. 121, for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale. The Statement retains
most of the requirements of SFAS No. 121 related to the recognition of the impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used. There was no impact of adopting SFAS No. 144 in 2002.

In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 145
“Rescission of FASB Statements Nos. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB No. 14, and Technical Corrections.” The Statement rescinds or amends a number of existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify
meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. In 2002, with the retirement of its Meridian Gold debentures, the company elected to adopt SFAS No. 145 early and recorded a $3.1 million loss ($1.9 million after-tax) in 2002
related to the early retirement of these debentures in selling, general and administrative expenses in accordance with the Statement.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”). FIN 45 requires that the guarantor recognize, at the inception of certain guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing such
guarantees. FIN 45 also requires additional disclosure about the guarantor’s obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective
basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, and the disclosure requirements are effective after December 15, 2002 and are included in Note 17.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and
Disclosure—An amendment of FASB Statement No. 123” (“SFAS No. 148”). This statement amends SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The transition and annual disclosure
provisions of FSAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. Effective January 1, 2003, FMC adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 regarding disclosure requirements for condensed consolidated financial
statements for interim periods. The company has determined that it will not make the voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.

On January 1, 2001, the company implemented SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively, the “Statement”). The Statement requires the company to recognize all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, with changes in the
fair value of derivative instruments to be recorded in current earnings or deferred in other comprehensive income, depending on the type of hedging transaction and whether a derivative is designated as an effective hedge. (See “Derivative
financial instruments” for further details.)

New accounting standards

.    In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The company expects to adopt the provisions of this pronouncement in 2003, as required. The effects of adoption, if any, are being evaluated.

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” This standard addresses the accounting and reporting for costs of so-called “exit activities” (including restructuring) and for the disposal of long-lived
assets. The standard changes some of the criteria for recognizing a liability for these activities. It is effective beginning in 2003 with the liability recognition criteria under the standard applied prospectively. The company will adopt SFAS No.
146 beginning in 2003 and is evaluating the potential impact of adoption on its accounting policies regarding exit and disposal activities.

NOTE 2    FMC’S
REORGANIZATION

In October 2000, the company
announced it was initiating a strategic reorganization (the “reorganization” or “separation”) that ultimately would split the company into two independent publicly held companies—a chemical company and a machinery company.
The remaining chemical company, which continues to operate as FMC Corporation, includes the Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals business segments. The new machinery company, Technologies, includes FMC’s former
Energy Systems and Food and Transportation Systems business segments. On June 1, 2001, in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement (the “Agreement”) between the two companies, FMC distributed substantially all of the net
assets comprising its energy and machinery businesses to Technologies. On June 19, 2001, Technologies completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of 17 percent of its equity through the issuance of common stock. FMC continued to own the
remaining 83 percent of Technologies until December 31, 2001.

Subsequent to the IPO, Technologies made payments of $430.7 million to FMC, net of contributions from FMC, in exchange for the net assets distributed to Technologies on June 1, 2001. Under the terms of the Agreement, Technologies
remitted $480.1 million to FMC in June 2001. The cash payment consisted of $280.9 million of proceeds from Technologies’ borrowings and $207.2 million of proceeds from Technologies’ initial public offering, less an agreed-upon sum of $8.0
million retained by Technologies to cover certain costs incurred by Technologies in conjunction with the initial public offering. The payments contributed to Technologies by FMC were to supplement Technologies’ operating cash needs prior to the
spin-off. The payments received by


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

FMC were used to retire short-term and long-term debt. During the second quarter of 2001, FMC recognized a $140.1 million gain in
stockholders’ equity on the sale of Technologies’ stock.

On November 29, 2001, FMC’s Board of Directors approved the spin-off of the company’s remaining 83 percent ownership in Technologies through a tax-free distribution to FMC’s stockholders (“the spin
off”). Effective December 31, 2001, the company distributed approximately 1.72 shares of Technologies common stock for every share of FMC common stock based on the number of FMC shares outstanding on the record date, December 12, 2001. The
distribution resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of $509.5 million.

The company recorded after tax losses from discontinued operations of $19.6 million and earnings of $51.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 related to the spun-off
Technologies business, including after tax interest expense of $6.8 million and $18.8 million, respectively, which was allocated to discontinued operations in accordance with APB 30 and later relevant accounting guidance (Note 1), and an additional
income tax provision of $28.8 million in 2001 related to the reorganization of FMC’s worldwide entities in anticipation of the separation of Technologies from FMC.

The total after tax costs related to the spin-off were $31.6 million at December 31, 2001, of which $15.1
million was classified as discontinued operations (Note 3).

NOTE 3    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

The company’s results of discontinued operations comprised the following:

During
2002, the company recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of $5.4 million ($3.3 million after tax) for environmental obligations at discontinued business sites (Note 11).

Effective December 31, 2001 the company completed the spin-off of Technologies (Note 2). The company recorded
a loss from discontinued operations of $42.5 million ($30.5 million after tax). Included in this before tax amount was a loss from Technologies of $19.6 million, which included interest expense of $11.2 million, which was allocated to discontinued
operations in accordance with APB 30 and later relevant accounting guidance, costs related to the spin-off and additional income tax provision related to the reorganization of FMC’s worldwide entities in anticipation of the separation of
Technologies from FMC. In addition, the company recorded a before tax charge of $18.0 million for updated estimates of environmental remediation costs related to FMC’s other discontinued businesses.

During 2000, the company recorded a net loss from discontinued
operations of $17.7 million ($15.0 million after tax). Of this amount, $64.0 million are the earnings of the spun-off Technologies business including interest expense of $30.9 million. Also included is an $80.0 million loss for a settlement of
litigation related to the discontinued Defense Systems business, and a charge of $1.7 million for interest on postretirement benefit obligations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Reserve for Discontinued Operations

.    The reserve for discontinued operations totaled $72.8 million and $86.3 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The liability at December 31, 2002 was
comprised of $6.4 million for worker’s compensation, product liability and other potential claims; $63.3 million for retiree medical and life insurance benefits provided to employees of former chemical businesses and the Construction Equipment
business; and $3.1 million related to the spin-off of Technologies.

The company uses actuarial methods, to the extent practicable, to monitor the adequacy of product liability and postretirement benefit reserves on an ongoing basis. While the amounts required to settle the company’s
liabilities for discontinued operations could ultimately differ materially from the estimates used as a basis for recording these liabilities, management believes that changes in estimates or required expenditures for any individual cost component
will not have a material adverse impact on the company’s liquidity or financial condition in any single year and that, in any event, such costs will be satisfied over many years.

Spending in 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $1.5 million, $7.9 million and $12.2 million, respectively, for product
liability and other claims; $2.1 million, $3.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively, for retiree benefits; and $9.2 million, $4.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively, related to net settlements of Defense Systems obligations.

NOTE 4    BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND JOINT VENTURES

The company made no significant
acquisitions in 2002, 2001 and 2000. All previous acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method and, accordingly, the purchase prices were allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values of such
assets and liabilities at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of the net tangible assets acquired were recorded as intangible assets, and when such an allocation was not possible, to goodwill. See Note 1
for the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142.

Joint ventures

.    Effective April 1, 2000, FMC and Solutia Inc. (“Solutia”) formed a joint venture that includes the North American and Brazilian phosphorus chemical operations of both companies.
The joint venture, Astaris LLC (“Astaris”), is a limited liability company owned equally by FMC and Solutia.

Solutia’s equity interest in the Fosbrasil joint venture, which is engaged in the production of purified phosphoric acid
(“PPA”), was also transferred and became part of Astaris. Astaris has also assumed all costs between FMC and NuWest relating to a PPA facility built at NuWest’s plant near Soda Springs, Idaho, and purchases all of the PPA output from
that facility as part of those agreements. The phosphate operations of FMC Foret were retained by FMC and were not transferred to the joint venture. Following its formation, Astaris divested certain operations in Lawrence, Kansas, and plant assets
located in Augusta, Georgia.

Effective April 1,
2000, FMC has accounted for its investment in Astaris under the equity method. As a result of the non-recurring 2001 activities discussed in detail in Notes 5 and 6, FMC’s equity investment in Astaris was negative $10.2 million at December 31,
2002 and negative $31.1 million at December 31, 2001. FMC’s share of Astaris’ earnings is included in the Industrial Chemicals segment. FMC’s total sales from phosphorus chemicals were $79.2 million for the three months ended March
31, 2000.

In the third quarter of 2000, FMC
received a cash distribution from Astaris of $110.3 million. This amount included $21.5 million in satisfaction of FMC’s receivable from the joint venture, resulting from FMC providing its share of operating capital to the joint venture during
the interim period between its formation and the procurement of financing from an external source.


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The company is party to a number of smaller joint venture investments throughout the world, which individually and in the aggregate are not significant to its financial results. FMC’s equity in earnings of affiliates, which
included the company’s share of Astaris earnings, were $4.7 million, $8.6 million and $18.5 million for the years ended December 31 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

NOTE 5    ASSET IMPAIRMENTS

Asset impairments totaled $323.1 million ($233.8 million after tax) in 2001 and $10.1 million ($6.2 million
after tax) in 2000.

FMC recorded asset
impairment charges in its Industrial Chemicals and Specialty Chemicals segments in 2001. Industrial Chemicals recorded impairment charges of $224.2 million of which $12.3 million related to the impairment of assets in the company’s sodium
cyanide operations while $211.9 million was for the impairment in its U.S.-based phosphorus chemicals business.

A weakening market in its sodium cyanide business led FMC to impair the assets of this business in the second quarter of 2001 and
ultimately exit the business in 2002.

FMC’s
U.S.-based phosphorus chemicals business is comprised of its 50 percent interest in Astaris for the manufacture and sale of phosphorus chemicals, and the activities of the company’s corporate phosphorus chemicals division, which manages
remediation and other environmental projects associated with the former Astaris elemental phosphorus plant in Pocatello, Idaho.

Based upon a comprehensive review of its long-lived assets, the company recorded asset impairment charges of $211.9 million related to its
U.S.-based phosphorus chemicals business in the second quarter of 2001. The components of asset impairments related to this business include a $171.0 million impairment of environmental assets built to comply with a Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (“RCRA”) Consent Decree (the “Consent Decree”) at the Pocatello, Idaho facility, a further $4.4 million of other non-environmental phosphorus chemical related fixed assets and a $36.5 million impairment charge for
its investment in Astaris. Driving these charges were a decline in market conditions, the loss of a potential site on which to develop an economically viable second PPA plant and the company’s agreement to pay into a fund for the Shoshone
Bannock Tribes (the “Tribal Fund”) resulting from an agreement to support a proposal to amend the Consent Decree, which permitted the earlier closure of the largest remaining waste disposal pond at Pocatello.

In addition, the company recorded an impairment charge of
$98.9 million related to its Specialty Chemicals segment’s lithium operations in Argentina. The company established this operation, which includes a lithium mine and processing facilities, approximately six years ago in a remote area of the
Andes Mountains. The entry of a South American manufacturer into this business resulted in decreased revenues. In addition, market conditions continued to be unfavorable. As a result, the company’s lithium assets in Argentina became impaired,
as the total capital invested is not expected to be recovered.

During 2000 FMC recorded asset impairments of $10.1 million. Impairments of $9.0 million were recognized from the formation of Astaris (Note 4), including the write down of certain phosphorus assets retained by the company and the
accrual of costs related to the company’s planned closure of two phosphorus facilities. Other impairments were due to the impact of underlying changes within the Specialty Chemicals segment.

NOTE 6    RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

Restructuring and other charges totaled $30.1 million ($18.4 million after tax), $280.4 million ($172.1 million after tax) and $35.2 million ($21.7 million after tax) for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

In an effort
to mitigate the effects of the continued economic weakness in the markets served by FMC’s Industrial Chemicals business the company undertook several key reorganization and cost saving initiatives that resulted in $12.4 million of restructuring
charges in 2002. Included in this amount was a $5.7 million restructuring charge for the mothballing of the basic production line at the hydrogen peroxide facility in Spring Hill, West Virginia. Of the 16 severances incurred related to the Spring
Hill mothballing, the majority will occur in the first half of 2003. FMC also mothballed its Granger caustic facility, in Green River, Wyoming resulting in a $3.4 million restructuring charge. The majority of this charge was for facility shutdown
activities and 110 severances, all of which occurred in 2002. In addition, the company recorded a $3.3 million restructuring charge for severance costs related to reorganization efforts to reduce costs in its U.S. phosphorus division, alkali
division, peroxygens division and at Foret. The majority of these charges were for 38 severances which occurred in 2002. In addition the company recorded $2.6 million of other charges to increase reserves for environmental obligations at several
Industrial Chemicals operating sites.

The
company incurred $4.7 million of restructuring charges related to its Agricultural Products business segment in 2002 of which $3.7 million related to the idling and reorganization of its sulfentrazone plant in Baltimore in connection with its new
herbicides strategy. A $1.0 million restructuring charge was recorded for reorganization costs to implement a new distribution strategy in Europe, which will allow FMC to rely on certain strategic alliances to further penetrate and expand its
European markets. Of the 108 severances related to these restructurings 57 occurred in 2002.

The company recorded $1.3 million of restructuring charges in its Specialty Chemicals segment in 2002 in an effort to realign product divisions within BioPolymer, both domestically and internationally.
The majority of these costs resulted in 24 severances which are expected to occur in the first half of 2003. In addition the company recorded $0.6 million of other charges to increase reserves for environmental obligations at several Specialty
Chemicals operating sites.

Restructuring and
other charges included a $3.1 million charge for the early extinguishment of debt. The majority of this cost related to the redemption of 6.75 percent exchangeable senior subordinated debentures related to Meridian Gold completed on June 3, 2002. An
additional $3.7 million of charges were recorded for reorganization costs related to the spin-off and distribution of Technologies stock and transition costs related to a change in benefits administrator associated with the spin-off. In addition,
the company recorded $1.7 million of other charges to increase reserves for environmental obligations related to a multi-segment research and development facility.

Of the $30.1 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2002 $11.9 million was spent in 2002. FMC expects
the remainder to be spent in 2003. For details on the remaining reserves see the table below.

respectively.

(7)

Included in “Accrued and other liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In 2001 a change in market conditions and the implementation
of FMC’s overall corporate strategy resulted in restructuring and other charges of $280.4 million.

Industrial Chemicals recorded restructuring and other charges of $247.9 million in 2001, of which $6.2 million was for restructuring at
several sites, including $5.7 million for the mothballing of these reserves recorded in the Granger, Wyoming soda ash facility, and $241.7 million for the U.S.-based phosphorus business. There were 130 severances resulting from the restructuring of
Industrial Chemicals, the majority of which occurred in 2001.

In connection with the impairment of the U.S.-based phosphorus business in the second quarter of 2001, the company recorded other charges for a $68.7 million reserve for further required Consent Decree spending at the Pocatello site
related to environmental capital projects, $42.7 million for financing obligations to the Astaris joint venture (“keepwell” payments) and a $40.0 million payment to the Tribal Fund for various tribe activities in order to permit capping of
a specific waste disposal pond at Pocatello.

Subsequent to the recording of these charges in the second quarter of 2001, the Astaris joint venture announced its plans, in October 2001, to cease production at the Pocatello, Idaho elemental phosphorus facility in December 2001.
This decision reflected the shift in Astaris’s sourcing strategy away from production of high cost elemental phosphorus to lower cost PPA, and also reflected the availability of low-cost alternative feedstock materials, projected higher future


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

environmental compliance costs at Pocatello and our desire to avoid additional capital spending on environmental compliance assets required
under the Consent Decree. In connection with the decision to shut down Pocatello, the company recorded restructuring charges of $76.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 and spent $32.3 million and $0.9 million of these reserves in 2002 and 2001,
respectively, with the remaining reserves to be spent over the next 5 to 7 years as the company manages the site’s decommissioning and environmental issues. These charges included reserves for decontamination, demolition, and other shutdown
costs of $58.7 million, environmental remediation requirements resulting from the decision to shut down the facility of $54.3 million and FMC’s 50 percent share of costs recorded by Astaris for its obligations associated with the shutdown, or
$36.3 million. Offsetting these charges was a reversal in the amount of $34.5 million representing the unspent portion of the reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2001 for required Consent Decree spending at the Pocatello site to build
environmental compliance assets because the decision to shut down the site eliminated the need for further spending. The company also recorded as an offset to these charges a commitment from Astaris to pay FMC $36.5 million over the next 5 years,
reflecting the joint venture’s obligation to contribute to the costs for the shutdown and remediation of the site. The company received $3.7 million from Astaris in 2002 related to this commitment and expects future payments to be funded from
Astaris’s savings from the shutdown.

Also
included in the $241.7 million of restructuring and other charges related to the U.S.-based phosphorus business was a charge of $12.0 million for other restructuring activities which were not directly related to the shutdown of Pocatello. Included
in this charge were restructuring activities related to severance and decommissioning of a coke facility as well as charges related to the shutdown of two furnaces at Pocatello.

In 2001 the company recorded $12.5 million of severance and other costs related to its Agricultural Products
segment as a result of its strategic refocusing on key geographic markets and crops and the realignment of the company’s R&D resources to its core strength in insecticides. The majority of the spending related to these charges occurred in
2002. These charges will result in future savings in both selling and administrative expenses and research and development costs. There were 163 severances related to these charges, the majority of which occurred in 2002.

Of the remaining 2001 restructuring and other charges of $20.0
million, approximately $17.5 million related to corporate reorganization costs due to the spin-off of Technologies with remaining charges of $2.5 million related to restructuring in Specialty Chemicals. The majority of the spending associated with
these charges occurred in 2001 and in the first half of 2002. The benefit of the restructuring and other charges related to FMC’s corporate reorganization and spin-off are not subject to reasonable estimation. The benefits were directly related
to improving stockholder value through creating a focused chemical company. There were approximately 45 severances related to the spin-off of Technologies, the majority occurring in 2001.

During 2000, the company recorded restructuring and other charges of $35.2 million ($21.7 million after tax).
Restructuring charges of $20.6 million were attributable to the formation of Astaris and the concurrent reorganization of the Industrial Chemicals sales, marketing and support organizations, the reduction of office space requirements in FMC’s
Philadelphia chemical headquarters and pension expense related to the separation of phosphorus personnel from the company. In addition, the company recorded environmental accruals of $12.5 million because of increased cost estimates for ongoing
remediation of several phosphorus properties. Other restructuring charges included $2.1 million for other projects. Of the approximately 350 employee severances that were expected to occur through the completion of these programs in 2000, 281
occurred at December 31, 2000 while the remainder occurred in 2001. All reserves resulting from the 2000 restructuring and other charges were spent as of December 31, 2001.

December 31, 2002 there was $41.0 million of principal amount outstanding of variable rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds supported by $43.4 million in bank letters of credit.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the company made
payments of $10.4 million, $25.0 million, and $99.5 million in the first, second and fourth quarter, respectively, for scheduled maturities of long-term debt.

Also affecting long-term debt was the redemption of the company’s 6.75 percent exchangeable senior subordinated debentures. On May 3,
2002, FMC published notice of a mandatory call for redemption on June 3, 2002 of its 6.75 percent exchangeable senior subordinated debentures, outstanding in the principal amount of $28.8 million. From May 21, 2002 to May 31, 2002, holders of $26.0
million of these debentures exercised their right to forego accrued but unpaid interest and exchange their debentures for common shares of Meridian Gold, Inc., a Canadian company trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: MDG) and successor to
FMC’s former subsidiary, at a price of $15.125 per share, subject to certain adjustments. Because FMC did not hold any shares of Meridian Gold, Inc. it exercised its right to pay the fair market value, subject to certain adjustments, of the
Meridian Gold common shares in cash. Because the price of Meridian Gold common shares rose substantially

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

above the exchange price of $15.125, FMC was required to pay an amount above the principal amount of the debentures exchanged, which resulted
in a net charge of approximately $3.1 million ($1.9 million after tax) in the second quarter of 2002. The remaining $2.8 million of debentures were redeemed on June 3, 2002 at the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest.

In 2002, the company redeemed $17.1 million of its 6.375
percent debentures due September 2003 at a premium of $0.2 million.

The company’s long-term debt maturities, before discounts, as of December 31, 2002 are: $167.8 million in 2003, $3.1 million in 2004, $63.3 million in 2005, $3.4 million in 2006, $292.4 million in 2007, and $682.6
million in 2008 and therafter.

Refinancing

On October 21, 2002, the company issued $355.0 million
aggregate principal amount of its 10.25 percent senior secured notes due 2009 (the “Notes”). Simultaneously, the company executed a new $500.0 million senior secured credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for a
$250.0 million revolving credit facility and a $250.0 million senior secured term loan, and obtained a $40.0 million supplemental secured standby letter of credit facility (the “Supplemental Letter of Credit Facility” and together with the
Credit Agreement, the “Credit Facilities”). The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes and the initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to:

•

Fund $260.0 million into a debt reserve account (the “Debt Reserve Account”), included in restricted cash, to redeem $99.5 million in aggregate principal
amount of our 7.125 percent medium-term notes due November 2002 and $160.5 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375 percent debentures due in September 2003.

•

Repay all borrowings under and terminate the former $240.0 million revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility, which had outstanding
amounts of $136.1 million and $65.0 million, respectively, both of which were terminated on October 21, 2002;

•

Fund into a restricted cash account (the “Restricted Cash Collateral Account”), included in restricted cash, $130.8 million to refinance and replace with
cash collateral certain surety bonds and letters of credit supporting self-insurance programs, environmental obligations and future business commitments and provide $43.4 million of cash to collateralize letters of credit supporting variable rate
industrial and pollution control revenue bonds; and

•

Pay fees and expenses of approximately $21 million, which included bank fees and various other costs.

Summary of Terms of the Notes

The Notes bear interest at the rate of 10.25 percent per
year. Interest on the Notes is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2003. The Notes mature on November 1, 2009.

The company may redeem all or part of the Notes on or prior to November 1, 2006 at a price of 100 percent of their principal amount, plus
a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. At any time after November 1, 2006, the company may redeem all or part of the Notes at fixed redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. At any time on or prior to
November 1, 2005, the company may redeem up to 35 percent of the Notes from the proceeds of one or more public equity offerings by the company at a fixed redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

The Notes are senior obligations and are guaranteed on a
senior basis by FMC’s wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, that guarantee indebtedness under the Credit Facilities its new $500.0 million Credit Agreement and the $40.0 million Supplemental Letter of Credit Facility which were entered into
concurrently with the issuance of the Notes. As of December 31, 2002, FMC’s subsidiaries that are not guarantors had approximately $ 211.9 million of liabilities to which the Notes are structurally subordinated.


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Notes are secured on a second-priority basis by collateral consisting of certain of the company’s domestic manufacturing or processing facilities and its shares of FMC Wyoming Corporation, its non-wholly-owned principal
domestic subsidiary. The second-priority liens are shared on an equal and ratable basis with the holders of indebtedness (“Existing Public Debt”) issued under the company’s existing indentures dated April, 1992 and July 1, 1996 (the
“Existing Public Indentures”) and with (i) the lenders and other credit providers under the Credit Facilities, (ii) certain other lenders and credit providers to the company and its foreign subsidiaries and (iii) lenders to Astaris LLC as
beneficiaries of its obligations under the support agreement relating to Astaris. This lien is subject and subordinate to the first-priority lien granted to such lenders and other credit providers in an amount not exceeding 10.0 percent of the
company’s consolidated net tangible assets from time to time. In addition, those lenders and credit providers are secured by liens on substantially all of the company’s other domestic assets that are not included in the collateral securing
the notes and on 65 percent of the stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries.

Summary Terms of the Credit Facility

The Credit Facilities replaced the company’s $240.0 million 364-day non-amortizing revolving credit facility which was due to expire in December of 2002 and a $25.0 million supplemental revolving credit facility due to expire on
October 31, 2002. Under the Credit Agreement, 0.25 percent of the original principal amount of the $250.0 million term loan is due and payable at the end of each quarter, commencing March 31, 2003, with the balance maturing on October 21, 2007.
Amounts under the $250.0 million revolving credit facility may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time until the maturity of the revolving credit facility on October 21, 2005. Up to $50.0 million of the revolving credit facility is
available for issuance of letters of credit on the company’s behalf. Voluntary prepayments and commitment reductions under the Credit Facilities are permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice and subject to minimum dollar amounts.
Subject to certain exceptions, mandatory prepayments are required with cash proceeds of asset sales, casualty events and condemnation proceeds, equity issuances and excess cash flow.

Subject to the availability of additional commitments by lenders, the aggregate commitment under the
revolving credit facility can be increased by up to $90.0 million to a total of $340.0 million. To the extent the commitments are increased to an amount in excess of $300.0 million, the excess is required to reduce the Supplemental Letter of Credit
Facility, and the amount available for letters of credit under the revolving credit facility will increase from $50.0 million to $75.0 million.

The Supplemental Letter of Credit Facility makes available prior to its maturity on October 21, 2005 up to $40.0 million for the issuance
of standby letters of credit.

Obligations under
the Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate, which is, at the company’s option, either a base rate or a London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), in each case plus an applicable margin. The base rate is Citibank N.A.’s
base rate. The applicable margins for the term loan are 3.75 percent per annum over the base rate and 4.75 percent per annum over LIBOR. The initial applicable margins for borrowings under the revolving credit facility is 2.50 percent over the base
rate and 3.50 percent over LIBOR. After March 31, 2003 the applicable margins under the revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment based on the company’s ratio of consolidated debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization.

Under the Credit Agreement, FMC is
required to pay a commitment fee on the difference between the total amount of the revolving credit facility and the amount borrowed by the company, or for which letters of credit were issued on its behalf, under the Credit Agreement. The initial
commitment fee is .50 percent of the unused commitment per year. The commitment fee is subject to adjustment based on the company’s leverage ratio.


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The company pays fees under the Supplemental Letter of Credit Facility on the face amount of letters of credit issued thereunder at a rate per year equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR loans under the revolving credit facility
under the Credit Agreement, plus 0.25 percent. The company also pays a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Supplemental Letter of Credit Facility at the same rate applicable to its revolving credit facility.

The obligations of FMC under these facilities are guaranteed
by each of its existing and subsequently acquired direct and indirect material wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries subject to certain exceptions for subsidiaries that are insignificant to the company’s operations. The obligations of FMC under
the Credit Facilities are secured on a first-priority basis by substantially all of the domestic tangible and intangible assets of the company and its domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries, including a pledge of 100.0 percent of the stock of domestic
subsidiaries and at least 65.0 percent of the stock of first-tier foreign subsidiaries. The company’s pledge of the collateral that secures the Notes and the Existing Public Debt is limited on a first-lien basis to an aggregate amount not to
exceed 10.0 percent of consolidated net tangible assets as noted above and thereafter is shared on an equal ratable basis with the existing public debt and notes. The Credit Facilities are also secured by all of the cash of the company including
cash held in the Debt Reserve Account and the Restricted Cash Collateral Account to the extent the latter is available. The Credit Facilities are secured equally and ratably with the company’s obligations owed to certain other lenders to the
company and its foreign subsidiaries and under the company’s support agreement with respect to Astaris.

Covenants

Among other restrictions, the Credit Facilities contain financial covenants related to leverage (measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to debt), interest coverage (measured as the ratio of interest expense to adjusted
earnings), consolidated net worth and capital spending. FMC was in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2002.

Short-term Debt

Short-term debt decreased to $64.3 million at December 31, 2002 compared to $136.5 million at December 31, 2001. Short-term debt consists
of commercial paper (in 2001), borrowings under committed credit facilities and foreign bank borrowings. Since the lowering of FMC’s short-term credit rating by Moody’s Investor’s Service, Inc. on June 13, 2002, FMC ceased offerings
under its commercial paper program and repaid maturities by borrowing under its then existing $240.0 million revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2002, no commercial paper was outstanding compared to $33.0 million at December 31, 2001.

The current portion of long-term debt was $166.8
million at December 31, 2002 compared to $135.2 million at December 31, 2001. This increase is attributed to the September 2003 maturity of the company’s $143.3 million 6.375 percent debentures and $20.0 million 6.530 percent medium term note
due December 2003. An amount sufficient to repay a 6.375 percent debentures is included in restricted cash.

Compensating Balance Agreements

FMC maintains informal credit arrangements in many foreign countries. Foreign lines of credit, which include overdraft facilities, typically do not require the maintenance of compensating balances, as
credit extension is not guaranteed but is subject to the availability of funds.

NOTE 11    ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS

FMC is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants, discharges of water pollutants, and the manufacture, storage,
handling and disposal of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes and other toxic materials and remediation of contaminated sites. The company is also subject to liabilities arising under CERCLA and similar state laws that impose responsibility on
persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances, and on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the clean-up of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment. In addition, the company is
subject to liabilities under RCRA and analogous state laws that require owners and operators of facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste to follow certain waste management practices and to clean up releases of hazardous waste into
the environment associated with past or present practices.

FMC has been named a potentially responsible party, or PRP, at 26 sites on the federal government’s National Priority List. In addition, the company also has received notice from the EPA or other regulatory agencies that the
company may be a PRP, or PRP equivalent, at other sites, including 43 sites at which the company has determined that it is reasonably possible that the company has an environmental liability. In cooperation with appropriate government agencies, FMC
is currently participating in, or has participated in, a RI/FS or its equivalent at most of the identified sites, with the status of each investigation varying from site to site. At certain sites, a RI/FS has only recently begun, providing limited
information, if any, relating to cost estimates, timing, or the involvement of other PRPs; whereas, at other sites, the studies are complete, remedial action plans have been chosen, or a ROD has been issued.

Environmental liabilities consist of obligations relating to
waste handling and the remediation and/or study of sites at which the company is alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances. These sites include current operations, previously operated sites, and sites associated with discontinued operations.
The company has provided reserves for potential environmental obligations that management considers probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the obligation could be made. Accordingly, total reserves of $223.4 million and $260.4 million,
respectively, before recoveries, were recorded at December 31, 2002 and 2001. The long-term portion of these reserves is included in “Environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of
recoveries, and amounted to $171.0 million and $203.5 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The short-term portion of these obligations are recorded in accrued and other liabilities. In addition, the company has estimated that
reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as $80.0 million at December 31, 2002.

To ensure FMC is held responsible only for its equitable share of site remediation costs, FMC has initiated, and will continue to
initiate, legal proceedings for contributions from other PRPs. FMC has recorded recoveries, representing probable realization of claims against insurance companies, U.S. government agencies and other third parties, of $27.7 million and $41.5
million, respectively, at December 31, 2002 and 2001. These recoveries are recorded as an offset to the “Environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued.” Cash recoveries for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $16.2 million, $12.5
million and $14.2 million, respectively. During 2001 the company recognized additional receivables for recoveries of $6.9 million.


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The table below is a rollforward of the company’s environmental reserves, continuing and discontinued from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002.

(1)

“Current” includes only those reserves related to continuing operations.

(2)

Balance includes environmental remediation reserves related to the shutdown of Pocatello recorded as part of Pocatello shutdown, remediation and other costs reserve
in 2001. (See rollforward of restructuring and other charges table in Note 6.)

(3)

Pocatello remediation reserve created prior to the decision to shut down the facility in 2001.

(4)

Additional remediation reserves recorded at the time of the Pocatello shutdown (Note 6).

The company’s total environmental reserves, before recoveries, include $212.4 million and $245.7 million
for remediation activities and $11.0 million and $14.7 million for RI/FS costs at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. For the years 2002, 2001 and 2000, FMC charged $41.3 million, $31.3 million and $44.3 million, respectively, against
established reserves for remediation spending, and $8.3 million, $12.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively, against reserves for spending on RI/FS. FMC anticipates that the remediation and RI/FS expenditures for current operating, previously
operated and other sites will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future.

In December of 2001, Astaris ceased production at the Pocatello, Idaho elemental phosphorus facility. FMC is responsible for decommissioning of the plant and remediation of the site at an estimated
cost (net of expected recoveries of $6.9 million from Astaris) of $46.7 million, which was reserved at December 31, 2001. To manage decommissioning and remediation more effectively, FMC reacquired the facility from Astaris in February 2002. The
estimated closure and remediation costs include the remaining costs of compliance with a June 1999 Consent Decree settling outstanding violations under RCRA at the Pocatello facility, costs expected under a July 2002 Consent Order with the Idaho
Department of Environmental Quality (“Idaho Consent Order”) and costs to be incurred under a 1998 ROD under CERCLA which addresses previously closed ponds on the Pocatello facility portion of the Eastern Michaud Flats Superfund Site. The
company had previously signed a Consent Decree under CERCLA to implement this ROD, which was lodged in court on July 21, 1999. On August 3, 2000, the


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Department of Justice (“DOJ”) withdrew the CERCLA Consent Decree and announced that it needed to review the administrative record
supporting the EPA’s remedy selection decision. Management believes that the company’s reserves for environmental costs adequately provide for the estimated costs of the existing ROD for the site, the expenses previously described related
to the RCRA Consent Decree, the Idaho Consent Order and the incremental costs associated with the decommissioning and remediation of the facility associated with the cessation of production. Management cannot predict the potential changes in the
scope of the ROD, if any, resulting from the EPA’s remedy review, nor estimate the potential incremental costs, if any, of changes to the existing remedy.

In 2002, the company recorded environmental provisions totaling $10.2 million ($6.2 million after tax). These provisions related to costs
for the continued cleanup of both operating sites and for certain discontinued manufacturing operations from previous years. In 2001, environmental provisions totaling $68.8 million ($42.0 million after tax) were recorded largely related to the
remediation of the Pocatello site. Also included in the 2001 provision were costs related to continued cleanup of certain discontinued manufacturing operations from previous years. In 2000, FMC recorded a charge of $12.5 million ($7.6 million after
tax) to provide additional reserves for ongoing remediation of several phosphorus properties. Although these properties are part of Astaris (Note 4) FMC retains certain remedial liabilities associated with the properties.

At its facility in Middleport, New York, the company is
performing remediation of soil and groundwater and investigating levels of potential contaminants in the soil at various properties in the area of the site under a RCRA Corrective Action Order. Management believes that the current reserve is
sufficient to address the existing onsite remediation project and clean-up of soil, if necessary, at properties adjacent to the site. However, additional costs could result if more extensive off-site remediation is required than is currently
anticipated. Costs are included in the estimate of reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies noted above.

On October 21, 1999, the Federal District Court for the Western District of Virginia approved a consent decree signed by FMC, the EPA
(Region III) and the DOJ regarding past response costs and future clean-up work at the discontinued fiber-manufacturing site in Front Royal, Virginia. As part of a prior settlement, government agencies are expected to reimburse the company for
approximately one-third of the clean-up costs due to the government’s role at the site. The company’s $70 million portion of the settlement was charged to earnings in 1998 and prior years. The amount of the reserve for anticipated
expenditures at the company’s former site in Front Royal, Virginia, is $44.1 million.

Although potential environmental remediation expenditures in excess of the reserves and estimated loss contingencies could be significant, the impact on the company’s future consolidated financial
results is not subject to reasonable estimation due to numerous uncertainties concerning the nature and scope of contamination at many sites, identification of remediation alternatives under constantly changing requirements, selection of new and
diverse clean-up technologies to meet compliance standards, the timing of potential expenditures and the allocation of costs among PRPs as well as other third parties.

The liabilities arising from potential environmental obligations that have not been reserved for at this time
may be material to any one quarter or year’s results of operations in the future. Management, however, believes any liability arising from potential environmental obligations is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s
liquidity or financial condition and may be satisfied over the next 20 years or longer.

Regarding current operating sites, the company spent $9.7 million, $87.4 million and $79.4 million for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, on capital projects relating to environmental control
facilities. Additionally, in 2002, 2001 and 2000, FMC spent $24.5 million, $35.9 million and $44.0 million, respectively,


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

for environmental compliance costs, which are an operating cost of the company and are not covered by established reserves. A significant
majority of the 2001 and 2000 spending was associated with the Consent Decree for the company’s U.S.-based phosphorus chemicals business.

NOTE 12    PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The funded status of the company’s domestic qualified and non-qualified pension plans, the United
Kingdom pension plan, the defined benefit portion of the company’s Canadian retirement plan and the company’s domestic postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefit plans for continuing operations, together with the associated
balances recognized in the company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, were as follows:


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table summarizes the assumptions used and the components of net annual benefit cost (income) for the years ended December 31:

The
change in the discount rate used in determining domestic pension and other postretirement benefit obligations from 7.00 percent to 6.50 percent increased the projected pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $47.6 at December 31,
2002. The change in the rate of compensation increase used in determining pension plan obligations from 4.25 percent to 4.00 percent decreased the projected benefit obligation by approximately $3.2 million at December 31, 2002.

The company recorded a charge, before tax, of $76.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002 to other comprehensive income to reflect the additional minimum pension liability adjustment.

In 2001, the change in the discount rate used in determining domestic pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at December 31,
from 7.50 percent to 7.00 percent, increased the projected pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $44.0 million.

Effective May 1, 2001, in connection with the IPO of Technologies, the company transferred $251.5 million in qualified domestic pension
plan assets to Technologies’ pension trust. As a result of the transfer, the company’s qualified pension plan obligation was reduced by $262.3 million. This initial allocation of assets and obligations, determined in accordance with the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) guidelines, between the company’s and Technologies’ plans and trusts was estimated in 2001 and then finalized during 2002. Also in connection with the IPO of Technologies,
the benefit obligation for the company’s nonqualified pension plans was reduced by approximately $21.0 million. The company also transferred $77.4 million in foreign pension plan assets to Technologies’ foreign plans and trusts, which in
turn reduced the company’s foreign pension plan obligation by approximately $78.0 million. In addition, effective December 31, 2001, a portion of the company’s domestic other postretirement benefit obligations was assumed by Technologies.


FMC CORPORATION

The postretirement medical obligations shown reflect a change in the assumed medical trend rate effective December 31, 2002. For measurement purposes, 9 percent and 11 percent increases in the per capita cost of health care benefits
for pre-65 and post-65 retirees, respectively, were assumed for 2003, grading down to an ultimate rate of 6 percent in 2009 and later years.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one-percentage point change in the
assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects at December 31, 2002:

The
company has adopted SFAS No. 87, “Employer’s Accounting for Pensions,” for its defined benefit plans for substantially all employees in the United Kingdom and Canada. The financial impact of compliance with SFAS No. 87 for other
non-U.S. pension plans is not materially different from the locally reported pension expense. The cost of providing pension benefits for foreign employees, net of the cost associated with Technologies’ foreign pension plans in 2000, was $2.6
million in 2002, $1.6 million in 2001 and $1.2 million in 2000.

In April 2000, the company formed Astaris, a joint venture (Note 4). As a result, the former Phosphorus Chemical Division’s active employees began receiving benefits under Astaris’s plans and are not accruing further
benefit in the FMC plan, the effect of which was a reduction in annual service cost of approximately $2.0 million. Under the joint venture agreement, Astaris agreed to fund an equal portion of FMC’s and Solutia’s future postretirement
benefit payments. FMC’s receivable from Astaris, representing the minimum amount of cash to be received under this portion of the agreement, amounted to $15.9 million at December 31, 2002 and $17.4 million at December 31, 2001.

FMC Corporation Savings and Investment
Plan

.    The FMC Corporation Savings and Investment Plan is a qualified salary-reduction plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code in which substantially all domestic employees of the company may participate by
contributing a portion of their compensation. The company matches contributions up to specified percentages of each employee’s compensation depending on how the employee allocates his or her contributions. On September 28, 2001, in connection
with the spin-off of Technologies, the company transferred the 401(k) plan assets relating to Technologies’ plan participants to a separate trust established for the Technologies’ Savings and Investment Plan. Charges against income for the
company’s matching contributions, net of forfeitures and net of matching contributions associated with Technologies (for 2000) were $6.5 million in 2002, $7.3 million in 2001, and $7.7 million in 2000.

NOTE 13    STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS

The FMC 1995 Management Incentive Plan and the FMC 1995 Stock
Option Plan, approved by the stockholders on April 21, 1995, provided certain incentives and awards to key employees. In 2000, the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) which, subject to the
provisions of the plans, reviews and approves financial targets, and the times and conditions for payment, adopted the FMC Corporation Stock Appreciation Rights and Phantom Stock Plan to provide equity-based cash


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

compensation to foreign employees. Effective February 16, 2001, the FMC 1995 Management Incentive Plans and the FMC Corporation Stock
Appreciation Rights and Phantom Stock Plans were merged with, and into, the FMC 1995 Stock Option Plan. The merged plan was restated and renamed the FMC Corporation Incentive Compensation and Stock Plan (the “Plan”) and was approved by the
stockholders on April 20, 2001. The provisions for incentives under the Plan provide for the grant of multi-year incentive awards payable partly in cash and partly in common stock.

The provisions under the Plan and its predecessor plans for stock options provide for regular grants of
common stock options, which may be incentive and/or nonqualified stock options. The exercise price for stock options is not less than the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. Options are exercisable at the time designated by the
Committee in the option (four years for grants prior to 1995 and approximately three years for grants during 1995 and thereafter). Incentive and nonqualified options expire not later than 10 years from the grant date (15 years for grants prior to
1996).

Under the plans adopted in 1995, three
million shares became available for awards and options granted in 1995 and later years. These shares are in addition to the shares available from the predecessor plans. Cancellation (through expiration, forfeiture or otherwise) of outstanding awards
and options granted after 1989 increases the shares available for future awards or grants. On February 16, 2001, the Committee approved an additional 800,000 shares for use under the Plan. At December 31, 2001, 2.3 million shares were available for
future use under these plans. On February 14, 2002, the Committee approved an adjustment to the share allocation, increasing it to 4.4 million, based on a conversion factor of approximately 1.9, to reflect the change in the value of the stock
options and restricted shares following the spin-off of Technologies. The Plan was also amended to change the total number of shares under the Plan from 3.8 million to 7.2 million.

The company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 148 and, as permitted, has chosen not to
adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the Plan. Had compensation cost for options under the Plan been determined based on the fair value at
the grant date for awards in 2002, 2001 and 2000, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 148, the company’s net income and diluted earnings per share for the three years ended December 31, 2002 would have been reduced to the pro forma
amounts indicated below:

For
2000, pro forma net income and pro forma diluted earnings per share have been reclassified to reflect the changes in stock-based compensation related to the distribution of net assets related to the spin-off of Technologies (Note 2).

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively: dividend yield of zero for all years; expected volatility of 36.0 percent, 33.0 percent and
30.7 percent; risk-free interest rates of 4.5 percent, 4.8 percent and 6.7 percent; and expected lives of 5 years for all grants. The weighted average fair value of stock options, calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, granted
during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $13.29, $27.75 and $19.94, respectively.

On January 2, 2003, an additional 113,145 shares became
exercisable at a price of $26.26 with an expiration date of February 10, 2010.

Under the Plan, discretionary awards of restricted stock may be made to selected employees. The awards vest over periods designated by the Committee, with payment conditional upon continued employment.
Compensation cost is recognized over the vesting period based on the market value of the stock on the date of the award. At December 31, 2002, 348,733 shares of restricted stock were outstanding under the plan.

Under the FMC Deferred Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors,
a portion of the annual retainer for these directors was deferred and paid in the form of shares of the company’s common stock upon retirement or other termination of their directorships. Effective January 1, 1997, the Board of Directors
approved a comprehensive compensation plan that terminated the retirement plan for directors and increased the proportion of director compensation paid in common stock of the company. Benefits provided for and earned under the former plan were
converted into stock units payable in shares of common stock of the company upon retirement from the Board based on the fair market value of the common stock on December 31, 1996. The plan was amended and restated May 1, 2000 and renamed the FMC
Corporation Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. At December 31, 2002, stock units representing an aggregate of 46,199 shares of stock were credited to the non-employee directors’ accounts. In 1998 and 1999, non-employee directors were
also granted options to purchase shares of stock at the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. At December 31, 2002, options for 46,040 shares were outstanding at prices ranging from $33.76 to $40.56. These grants vested one year from
the grant date and expire after ten years. Beginning in 2000, non-employee directors were paid in restricted stock units in lieu of stock options. The shares, however, will not be paid out until retirement from the Board. At December 31, 2002 and
December 31, 2001 units representing 23,442 and 14,941 shares of stock were outstanding, respectively.

NOTE 14    STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

On June 6, 2002 the company issued 3,250,000 shares of common stock at a net price per share of $31.25. Net proceeds from the issuance of
these shares were $101.3 million. The proceeds were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the company’s then existing $240.0 million revolving credit facility. On December 31, 2001 the company distributed its remaining 83 percent
ownership in Technologies (Note 2). The distribution was tax free. Each stockholder of record as of December 12, 2001 received approximately 1.72 shares of Technologies stock for every share of FMC stock. Total shares of Technologies stock
distributed were 53,950,000. The company recorded the distribution through a $509.5 million decrease in retained earnings and a $115.0 million decrease in the cumulative translation loss. In 2002 the company made a distribution adjustment of $9.5
million for the final true-up of FMC’s 2001 distribution of Technologies assets.

The following is a summary of FMC’s capital stock activity over the past three years:

The
company discontinued its repurchase of stock in 2002, except for repurchases to administer its employee benefit plans. Shares of common stock repurchased and contributed to a trust for an employee benefit program (net of shares resold as needed to
administer the plan) were 9,900 shares, 69,656 shares and 9,470 shares in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, at a cost of approximately $0.5 million, $5.5 million and $0.6 million.

At December 31, 2002, 8.5 million shares of unissued FMC common stock were reserved for stock options and
awards.

At December 31, 2002 and 2001,
accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of cumulative foreign currency translation losses of $118.8 million and $158.6 million, respectively, and for 2002 minimum pension liability adjustments of $47.2 million, net of taxes of $29.6 million.
Also included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2002 and 2001 was a $13.9 million gain, net of taxes of $8.9 million and a $16.6 million loss, net of taxes of $10.2 million related to the increase and decrease, respectively, in the fair
value of currency and energy cash flow hedges (Notes 1 and 15).

Covenants under the new credit facility and debt agreements (Note 10) contain consolidated net worth and other requirements with which FMC was in compliance as of December 31, 2002.

On February 22, 1986, the Board of Directors of the company
declared a dividend distribution to each holder of record of common stock as of March 7, 1986, of one Preferred Share Purchase Right for each share of common stock outstanding on that date. Each right entitles the holder to purchase, under certain
circumstances related to a change in control of the company, one one-hundredth of a share of Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series A, without par value, at a price of $300 per share (subject to adjustment), subject to the terms and conditions
of a Rights Agreement dated February 22, 1986 as amended through February 9, 1996. The rights expire on March 7, 2006, unless redeemed by the company at an earlier date. The redemption price of $.05 per right is subject to adjustment to reflect
stock splits, stock dividends or similar transactions. The company has reserved 400,000 shares of Junior Participating Preferred Stock for possible issuance under the agreement.

NOTE 15    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

The company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade receivables, other current assets, accounts payable, and amounts included in investments and accruals
meeting the definition of financial instruments. These financial instruments are stated at their carrying value which is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

The following table of the estimated fair value of financial instruments is based on estimated fair-value amounts that have been
determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methods. Accordingly, the estimates presented may not be indicative of the amounts that FMC would realize in a current market exchange and do not represent potential gains or
losses on these agreements.

Fair
values of debt have been determined through a combination of management estimates and information obtained from independent third parties using market data, such as bid/ask spreads on the last business day of the year.

Derivative financial
instruments

.    The company conducts its business in many foreign countries, exposing earnings, cash flows, and the company’s financial position to a series of foreign currency risks. The majority of these risks
originate through foreign currency transactions. The company is also exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices.

FMC’s policy is to minimize its cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency, energy prices and exchange rates. This is
accomplished through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The company’s objective is to maintain economically balanced currency risk management strategies and energy risk management
strategies that provide adequate protection from significant fluctuations in the currency and energy markets.

The company enters into foreign exchange contracts, including forwards and purchased option contracts, to reduce the cash flow exposure of
foreign currency fluctuations associated with monetary assets and liabilities and highly anticipated transactions. The company also enters into forward contracts in an effort to mitigate changes in energy costs.


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Hedge ineffectiveness and the portions of derivative gains and losses excluded from assessments of hedge effectiveness related to the company’s outstanding cash flow hedges and which were recorded to earnings for the year ended
December 31, 2001, were less than $0.1 million. Changes in fair value of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2002 and 2001 the net deferred after-tax hedging loss in
accumulated other comprehensive income was $2.8 million and $16.6 million, respectively. Approximately $2.1 million of the 2002 losses are expected to be realized in earnings over the next twelve months ending December 31, 2003, as the underlying
hedging transactions are realized. At various times subsequent to December 31, 2003 the company expects losses from cash flow hedge transactions to total, in the aggregate, approximately $0.7 million. The company recognized its derivative gains and
losses in the cost of sales or services line of the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The company continues to hold certain forward contracts that have not been designated as hedging instruments. Contracts used to hedge the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with
certain monetary assets and liabilities are not designated as hedging instruments, and changes in the fair value of these items are recorded in earnings. The net gain recorded in earnings for contracts not designated as hedging instruments in 2002
and 2001 were $9.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively.

Fair values relating to derivative financial instruments reflect the estimated amounts that the company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on quoted market prices of comparable contracts as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, derivative financial instruments consisted primarily of foreign exchange forward contracts and energy forward contracts.

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the company held foreign exchange forward contracts with notional amounts
of $1,361.8 million and $1,227.1 million, respectively, in which foreign currencies (primarily the euro, Norwegian krone, British pound sterling, Austrialian dollar and Danish krone in 2002 and Norwegian krone, euro, British pound sterling, Japanese
yen and Singapore dollar in 2001) were purchased, and $1,398.5 million and $1,309.9 million, respectively, in which foreign currencies (primarily euro, Norwegian krone, British Pound Sterling, Australian dollar and Danish krone, euro, Norwegian
krone, Swedish krona, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Japanese yen in 2001 and euro, Swedish krona, British pound sterling and Japanese yen in 2000) were sold. Notional amounts are used to measure the volume of derivative financial
instruments.

Financial guarantees and letter
of credit commitments

.    FMC is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk as part of its normal course of business, including financial guarantees and contractual commitments to extend financial
guarantees under letters of credit and other assistance to its customers and the customers of its related parties (Notes 16 and 17). Decisions to extend financial guarantees to its customers, and the amount of collateral required under these
guarantees, is based on management’s evaluation of creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. These financial instruments represent elements of credit risk, which are not recognized on FMC’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 17.

The table below displays amounts related to
FMC’s financial guarantees and contractual commitments to extend financial guarantees and other assistance as of December 31, 2002.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

NOTE 16    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

FMC’s chemical and machinery businesses became two independent companies in 2001 through the spin-off of Technologies (Note 2). Prior to Technologies’ IPO, FMC and Technologies entered into
certain agreements, which are described below, for purposes of governing the ongoing relationship between the two companies at and after the date of the Technologies separation from FMC.

After the reorganization and spin-off, FMC and Technologies continued to be related in several general and
administrative areas. The Separation and Distribution Agreement (the “SDA”) includes provisions intended to govern this ongoing relationship by establishing indemnity responsibilities, allocating responsibility for costs of the IPO and
distribution, and establishing a process for the assignment of certain operating costs both prior to and after the IPO. The SDA also identified the assets to be transferred and the liabilities to be assumed by Technologies prior to the IPO.

According to the SDA, costs related to the IPO
were the responsibility of Technologies and costs related to the distribution of Technologies shares were the responsibility of FMC. These distribution costs, which were borne by FMC, were immaterial. The two companies also agreed to equally share
most general and administrative costs prior to the distribution, with FMC’s share of these expenses totaling $31.3 million in 2001.

The SDA provided for FMC and Technologies to enter into arrangements to govern the various interim relationships between the two
companies.

A transition services agreement was
entered into on December 31, 2001 between FMC and Technologies, which contemplated the provision of certain support services by one company to the other, such as cash management, accounting, tax, payroll, legal and other corporate, general and
administrative functions. These services, with the exception of certain benefit-related services, terminated on December 31, 2002. FMC’s costs related to these services totaled approximately $6 million in 2002.

FMC and Technologies entered into a tax sharing agreement
wherein each company is obligated for those taxes associated with their respective businesses, determined as if each company filed its own consolidated, combined or unitary tax returns for any period where Technologies is included in the
consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of FMC or its subsidiaries. Additionally, responsibility for all taxes for periods prior to the spin-off will be determined in the same manner. If, within thirty months following the spin-off,
Technologies breaches any representations in the tax sharing agreement relating to the favorable ruling FMC received from the IRS regarding the tax-free nature of the spin-off; takes or fails to take any action that causes such representations to be
untrue; engages in a sale of substantially all of its assets; undergoes a change of control; or, discontinues the conduct of its business, the spin-off may be taxable to FMC. In the event the spin-off is determined to be taxable to FMC as a result
of any of the foregoing, Technologies will be required to indemnify FMC for any resulting taxes, which would likely be material to FMC’s liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.

FMC and Technologies agreed that they would share insurance
coverage under FMC’s comprehensive general liability and property policies through the 2002 and 2001 renewals. The 2002 policies for general liability and property expire in September 2003 and March 2004, respectively, at which time FMC and
Technologies will establish separate programs. FMC and Technologies will also share, on an equal basis, past insurance policies, subject to reservation of disproportionate coverage in favor of FMC for all prior policy periods up to 1985. This is to
recognize certain legacy liabilities retained by FMC. If either company uses more than its share of the policy coverage, it must indemnify the other company to ensure that the indemnified company’s share of policy coverage is unaffected.


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

FMC agreed to guaranty the performance by Technologies of certain obligations under a number of contracts, debt instruments, and reimbursement agreements. The latter agreements are associated with certain letters of credit. Prior to
the spin-off, these obligations related to the businesses of Technologies. As of December 31, 2002, these guaranteed obligations totaled $14.5 million compared to $289.0 million at December 31, 2001. Under the SDA, Technologies agreed to indemnify
FMC for these obligations.

As of the
distribution on December 31, 2001 a portion of the previously identified shared costs and transitional costs had not been finalized. A payable to Technologies for an outstanding amount of $4.7 million was included in the December 31, 2001
consolidated balance sheet and was paid in the first half of 2002. In the third quarter of 2002, in conjunction with the final true-up of FMC’s 2001 distribution of Technologies assets, Technologies transferred $4.4 million to FMC.

FMC and Technologies generally did not engage in
any inter-company commercial transactions; accordingly, there were no significant intercompany purchases, sales, receivables or payables in 2002, 2001, or 2000 from transactions of a commercial nature.

FMC’s Board of Directors has several members who serve on
Technologies’ Board of Directors. They include: B.A. Bridgewater, Jr., James R. Thompson and Edward J. Mooney.

The company sold trade receivables without recourse through its wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, FMC Funding Corporation. These
transactions resulted in reductions of accounts receivable of $79.0 million at December 31, 2001. The company terminated this securitization program as part of its financing program (Note 10). Using proceeds from the refinancing the company made a
final payment of $65.0 million to terminate its account receivable securitization on October 21, 2002.

NOTE 17    COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

FMC leases office space, plants and facilities, and various types of manufacturing, data processing and transportation equipment. Leases
of real estate generally provide for payment of property taxes, insurance and repairs by FMC. Capital leases are not significant. Rent expense under operating leases amounted to $15.3 million, $13.0 million and $17.7 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Rent expense is net of credits (received for the use of leased transportation assets) of $21.2 million, $20.6 million and $18.6 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Minimum future rentals under noncancelable leases aggregated approximately $193.4 million, before recoveries,
as of December 31, 2002 and are estimated to be payable as follows: $28.4 million in 2003, $26.8 million in 2004, $25.1 million in 2005, $18.6 million in 2006, $15.3 million in 2007 and $79.2 million thereafter. Minimum future rentals for
transportation assets included above aggregated approximately $148.2 million, against which the company expects to continue to receive credits to substantially defray its rental expense.

The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” The Interpretation requires that the company recognize the fair value of guarantee and indemnification arrangements issued or modified by the company after December 31,
2002, if the arrangements are within the scope of that Interpretation. In addition, under previously existing generally accepted accounting principles, the company continues to monitor the conditions that are subject to the guarantees and
indemnifications to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred, and would recognize any such losses under the guarantees and indemnifications when those losses are estimable.


FMC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table provides the estimated undiscounted amount of potential future payments for each major group of guarantees and indemnifications:

For the
indemnification issued in connection with the divestiture of a portion of the company’s manufacturing business, a maximum amount of potential future payments cannot be determined because the indemnification is an unlimited obligation. See Note
16 for further details regarding the company’s significant indemnifications.

In connection with the finalization of Astaris’s external financing agreement during the third quarter of 2000, FMC provided an agreement to lenders of Astaris under which the company has agreed
to make equity contributions (“keepwell payments”) to Astaris sufficient to make up one half of any short-fall in Astaris earnings below certain levels. Astaris’s earnings did not meet the agreed levels for 2002 and 2001 and the
company does not expect that such earnings will meet the levels agreed for 2003. The company contributed $29.6 million and $31.3 million to Astaris under this arrangement in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and expects to contribute between $35 million
and $50 million in 2003 depending on Astaris’s performance and on their ability to successfully complete a refinancing in 2003. The proportional amount of Astaris indebtedness subject to this agreement from FMC at December 31, 2002 was $84.0
million.

The company provides guarantees to
financial institutions on behalf of certain Agricultural Products customers, principally in Brazil, for their seasonal borrowing. The customers’ obligations to FMC are largely secured by liens on their crops. Losses under these programs have
been minimal. The total of these guarantees secured by liens were $18.2 million recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as “Guarantees of Vendor Financing” at December 31, 2002 and $56.0 million at December 31, 2001.

The company also provides guarantees to financial institutions
on behalf of certain Agricultural Products customers in Brazil to support their importation of third-party agricultural products. This guarantee program began in 2001 and guarantees at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 were $4.5 million and
$10.0 million respectively.

In October 2000, the
company announced an agreement to settle a lawsuit related to its discontinued Defense Systems business. As a result, the company recorded $65.7 million (net of income taxes of $14.3 million) in its results of discontinued operations during the
quarter ended September 30, 2000. After receiving approval from the DOJ and the U.S. District Court, the company paid approximately $80.0 million to settle the lawsuit in January 2001.

Other Commitments

On
June 30, 1999, FMC acquired the assets of Tg Soda Ash, Inc. from Elf Atochem North America, Inc. for approximately $51.0 million in cash and a contingent payment due at year-end 2003. The contingent payment amount, which will be based on the
financial performance of the combined soda ash operations between 2001 and 2003, cannot currently be determined precisely but is expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million.

The company also has certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation, claims, performance
guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of its known contingencies will not materially affect the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows of FMC.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders, FMC Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of FMC Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in stockholders’ equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December
31, 2002. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the related financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index in Item 15(a)(2). These consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FMC Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December
31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in
our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” on January 1, 2002 and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative
