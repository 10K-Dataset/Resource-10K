ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General

We are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural, consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions, applications and market-leading products. We operate in three distinct business segments: FMC Agricultural Solutions, FMC Health and Nutrition and FMC Lithium. Our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment develops, markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals – insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. These products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects, weeds and disease, as well as in non-agricultural markets for pest control. The FMC Health and Nutrition segment focuses on nutritional ingredients, health excipients, and functional health ingredients. Nutritional ingredients are used to enhance texture, color, structure and physical stability. Health excipients are used for binding, encapsulation and disintegrant applications. Functional health ingredients are  used as active ingredients in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical markets. Our FMC Lithium segment manufactures lithium for use in a wide range of lithium products, which are used primarily in energy storage, specialty polymers and chemical synthesis application.

Discontinued Operations - FMC Alkali Chemicals

On April 1, 2015, we completed the sale of our FMC Alkali Chemicals division ("ACD") for

$1,649.8 million

to a wholly owned subsidiary of Tronox Limited ("Tronox"). The sale resulted in approximately

$1,198.5 million

in after-tax cash proceeds. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of

$1,080.2 million

(

$702.1 million

net of tax) for the year ended

December 31, 2015

. The results of ACD have been reclassified to reflect the business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented throughout this document.

Cheminova A/S

On April 21, 2015, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, we completed the acquisition of 100 percent of the outstanding equity of Cheminova A/S, a Denmark Aktieselskab ("Cheminova") from Auriga Industries A/S, a Denmark Aktieselskab for an aggregate purchase price of

$1.2 billion

, excluding assumed net debt and hedged-related costs of approximately

$0.6 billion

(the “Acquisition”).

Cheminova is being integrated into our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment. Since the closing date, Cheminova has been included within our reported results of operations for FMC Agricultural Solutions for the

twelve

months ended

December 31, 2015

.

FMC Strategy

2015 marked the completion of FMC’s multi-year portfolio transformation. Today, FMC is a company operating in attractive market segments that are supported by growth trends in agriculture, pharmaceuticals, nutrition, and energy storage.  Each of FMC’s businesses has the right elements in place to deliver continued growth in earnings and returns.

In Agricultural Solutions, the acquisition of Cheminova has expanded market access across Europe, Latin America and key Asia-Pacific markets such as India and Australia, and has brought greater balance to the revenue mix of FMC Agricultural Solutions across each of the major growing regions. The integration strengthens our leadership position in crop protection chemistry and expands our position in a variety of crop segments.  Our complementary technologies will lead to improved formulation capabilities and a broader innovation pipeline.  We continue to invest in R&D and remain committed to developing and commercializing new and differentiated products to address grower demands. We will also benefit from deeper regulatory expertise and access to local markets. FMC with the acquisition of Cheminova, has the scale to operate with greater resources and global reach to address changing market conditions.

In Health and Nutrition, we have a portfolio of naturally-derived, functional ingredients that serve health, nutraceutical and nutrition end markets. We provide innovative solutions to our customers by leveraging our application know-how in the nutrition, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical markets as well as differentiating the manufacture and delivery of our market leading products



through best in class Quality, Service, Reliability (QSR). With QSR at the forefront, we have recently undertaken an effort to improve our cost competition by optimizing our organizational and manufacturing footprints. We are implementing Manufacturing Excellence programs to drive operating improvements across our portfolio. As a technology-focused company, we continue to pursue process technology improvements and develop innovative application solutions to drive the highest value for customers.

In Lithium, FMC remains one of the leading global producers of specialty lithium products.  We will continue to invest in these higher growth, higher value segments of the market, including lithium hydroxide for energy storage and butyllithium for use in chemical synthesis

and high purity lithium metal for aerospace applications.

We maintain our commitment to enterprise sustainability, including responsible stewardship. As we grow, we will do so in a responsible way. Safety and business ethics will remain of utmost importance. Meeting and exceeding our customers’ expectations will continue to be a primary focus.

The following table shows the principal products produced by our three business segments, their raw materials and uses:

With a worldwide manufacturing and distribution infrastructure, we are better able to respond rapidly to global customer needs, offset downward economic trends in one region with positive trends in another and match local revenues to local costs to reduce the impact of currency volatility. The charts below detail our sales and long-lived assets by major geographic region.



FMC Agricultural Solutions

Overview

Our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment, which represents approximately

69 percent

of our


consolidated revenues, operates in the agrochemicals industry. This segment develops, manufactures and sells a portfolio of crop protection, professional pest control and lawn and garden products.

Products and Markets

FMC Agricultural Solutions' portfolio is comprised of three major pesticide categories: insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. The majority our product line consists of insecticides and herbicides, and we have a small but fast-growing portfolio of fungicides mainly used in high value crop segments. Our insecticides are used to control a wide spectrum of pests, while our herbicide portfolio primarily targets a large variety of difficult-to-control weeds. We are also investing substantially in a plant health program that includes biological crop protection products, seed treatments and micronutrients.

In the Latin American region, which includes the large agricultural market of Brazil, we sell directly to large growers through our own sales and marketing organization, and we access the market through independent distributors. In North America, we access the market through several major national and regional distributors and have our own sales and marketing organization in Canada. With the Cheminova acquisition, we now access a majority of the European markets through our own sales and marketing organizations. We access key Asian markets either through local independent distributors or our own sales and marketing organizations. Through these and other alliances, along with our own targeted marketing efforts, access to novel technologies and



our innovation initiatives, we expect to maintain and enhance our access in key agricultural and non-crop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively.

Industry Overview

The three principal categories of agricultural and non-crop chemicals are: herbicides, insecticides and fungicides, representing approximately 40 percent, 30 percent and 25 percent of global industry revenue, respectively.

The agrochemicals industry is relatively consolidated. Leading crop protection companies, Syngenta AG, Bayer AG, Monsanto Company, BASF AG, The Dow Chemical Company and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont), currently represent approximately 65 percent of the industry’s global sales. The next tier of agrochemical producers include FMC, ADAMA  Agricultural Solutions, Ltd., Sumitomo Chemical Company Ltd., Nufarm Ltd., Platform Specialty Products Corporation, and United Phosphorous Ltd. FMC employs various differentiated strategies and competes with unique technologies focusing on certain crops, markets and geographies, while also being supported by a low-cost manufacturing model.

Growth

The acquisition of Cheminova positions FMC among leading agrochemical producers in the world.  Our complementary technologies will lead to improved formulation capabilities and a broader innovation pipeline, resulting in new and differentiated products. We will take advantage of enhanced market access positions and an expanded portfolio to deliver near-term growth.

We will continue to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring, accessing, developing, marketing, distributing and/or selling complementary chemistries and related technologies in order to strengthen our product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers.

Our growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible and sustainable solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide cost-effective alternatives to chemistries which may be prone to resistance. We are committed to providing unique, differentiated products to our customers by acquiring and further developing technologies as well as investing in innovation to extend product life cycles. Our external growth efforts include product acquisitions, in-licensing of chemistries and technologies and alliances that bolster our market access, complement our existing product portfolio or provide entry into adjacent spaces. We have entered into a range of development and distribution agreements with other companies that provide access to new technologies and products which we can subsequently commercialize.



FMC Health and Nutrition

Overview

Our FMC Health and Nutrition segment, which represents

24 percent

of our


consolidated revenues, is focused on high-performance food ingredients, pharmaceutical excipients and Omega-3 oils. The majority of FMC Health and Nutrition sales are to customers in non-cyclical end markets. We believe our future growth in this segment will continue to be based on the value-added performance of these products and our research and development capabilities, as well as on the alliances and close working relationships we have developed with key global customers.

Products and Markets

Our product offerings into nutrition markets principally provide texture, structure and physical stability ("TSPS") solutions to thicken and stabilize certain food products. Our formulation ingredients serve the health excipient industry functioning as binders, disintegrants, suspending agents, and control-release compounds for the production of both solid and liquid pharmaceutical products.  The majority of our functional ingredient product offerings are high purity Omega-3 products as well as certain alginate products which are considered to be active pharmaceutical ingredients

FMC Health and Nutrition is a supplier of microcrystalline cellulose ("MCC"), carrageenan, alginates, natural colorants, and omega-3, all naturally derived ingredients that have high value-added applications in the production of processed and convenience foods, oral dose form pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals.  MCC, processed from specialty grades of renewable hardwood and



softwood pulp, provides binding and disintegrant properties for dry tablets and capsules and has unique functionality that improves the texture and stability of many nutrition products. Carrageenan and alginates, both processed from natural seaweeds, are used in a wide variety of food, pharmaceutical and oral care applications. Natural colorants are utilized in specialty products used in the food, beverage, personal care, nutrition and health excipient markets. Omega-3 is sourced from fish oils and use in other pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications

Industry Overview

Nutritional Ingredients

The industry is dispersed geographically, with sales in Europe, North America and Asia. The nutritional ingredients market is comprised of a large number of suppliers due to the broad spectrum of chemistries employed.  Segment leadership, global position and investment in technology are key factors to sustaining profitability. The top suppliers of TSPS ingredients include FMC, DuPont, J.M. Huber Corporation, Kerry Group plc and Cargill Incorporated.

Health Excipients and Functional Health Ingredients

Competitors tend to be grouped by chemistry. Our principal MCC competitors include J. Rettenmaier & Sôhne GmbH, Ming Tai Chemical Co., Ltd., Asahi Kasei Corporation and Blanver Farmoquimica Ltda. While pricing pressure from low-cost producers is a common competitive dynamic, companies look to offset that pressure by providing the most reliable and broadest range of products and services.  Our customers are pharmaceutical firms who depend upon reliable therapeutic performance of their drug products.  In Omega-3, our competitors include DSM, BASF, Croda and other smaller producers.  Competition has intensified in this market over the past several years as many smaller producers attempt to enter in what is considered by many as an attractive growth market. Differentiation among higher end producers such as FMC is achieved through know-how to produce high concentration oils at high levels of purity.

FMC Lithium

Overview

Our FMC Lithium segment, represents

seven percent

of our


consolidated revenues.

While lithium is sold into a variety of end markets, we have focused our strategy on specialty products that require a high level of manufacturing and technical know-how to meet customer requirements.

The electrochemical properties of lithium make it an ideal material for portable energy storage in high performance applications, including smart phones, tablets, laptop computers, military devices and other next-generation energy storage technologies. Lithium is a critical element in advanced batteries for use in hybrid electric, plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles.



Organolithium products are highly valued in the polymer market as initiators in the production of synthetic rubbers and elastomers. Organolithiums are also sold to fine chemical and pharmaceutical customers who use lithium's unique chemical properties to synthesize high value-added products.

Industry Overview

Our FMC Lithium serves a diverse group of markets. Our product offerings are primarily inorganic and generally have few cost-effective substitutes. A major growth driver for lithium in the future will be the rate of adoption of electric and hybrid electric batteries in automobiles.

Most markets for lithium chemicals  are global with significant growth occurring both in Asia and North America, primarily driven by the development and manufacture of lithium ion batteries. There are three key producers of lithium compounds: FMC,  Albemarle Corporation (previously Rockwood Holdings, Inc.) and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. Spodumene ore is also converted to lithium compounds by a large number of Chinese producers. We expect a few new producers to add capacity within the next 24 months. FMC and Albemarle Corporation are the primary producers of lithium specialty products.

Source and Availability of Raw Materials

Raw materials used by FMC Agricultural Solutions, primarily processed chemicals, are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide. Raw materials used by FMC Health and Nutrition include various types of seaweed,  specialty pulps,  natural colorant raw materials and fish oils that are all sourced on a global basis and purchased from selected global producers/suppliers. We extract ores used in FMC Lithium’s manufacturing processes from lithium brines in Argentina.

Patents

We own a number of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business. We do not believe that the loss of any individual or combination of related patents, trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of FMC. The duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions.

Seasonality

The seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the FMC Agricultural Solutions business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations. FMC Agricultural Solutions' products sold in the northern hemisphere (North America, Europe and parts of Asia) serve seasonal agricultural markets from March through September, generally resulting in earnings in the first, second and third quarters. Markets in the southern hemisphere (Latin America and parts of the Asia Pacific region, including Australia) are served from July through February, generally resulting in earnings in the third, fourth and first quarters. The remainder of our business is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations.

Competition

We encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments. We market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners, independent distributors and sales representatives. The number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment. In general, we compete by providing advanced technology, high product quality, reliability, quality customer and technical service, and by operating in a cost-efficient manner.

Our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. Industry products include crop protection chemicals and, for certain major competitors, genetically engineered (crop biotechnology) products. Competition from generic agrochemical producers is significant as a number of key product patents held industry-wide have expired in the last decade. In general, we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development, including novel formulations, proprietary mixes, and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing (mostly) proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus. We also differentiate ourselves by our global cost-competitiveness through our manufacturing strategies, establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions.

Our FMC Health and Nutrition segment has significant positions in markets that include alginate, carrageenan, and microcrystalline cellulose. We compete with both direct suppliers of cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids, which may provide similar functionality in specific applications. In microcrystalline cellulose, competitors are typically smaller than FMC, while in seaweed extracts (carrageenan and alginates) and Omega-3 fish oils, we compete with other broad-based chemical companies.



FMC Lithium segment sells lithium-based products worldwide. We and our two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithium-rich brines located in the Andes Mountains of Argentina and Chile, which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium.

Research and Development Expense

We perform research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the FMC Agricultural Solutions segment. The development efforts in the FMC Agricultural Solutions segment focus on developing environmentally sound solutions and new product formulations that cost-effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to existing and new chemistries. Our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below:

Environmental Laws and Regulations

A discussion of environmental related factors can be found in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 10 “Environmental Obligations” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

Employees

We employ approximately 6,000 people with about 1,200 people in our domestic operations and 4,800 people in our foreign operations.

Approximately 10 percent of our U.S.-based and 35 percent of our foreign-based employees, respectively, are represented by collective bargaining agreements. We have successfully concluded most of our recent contract negotiations without any material work stoppages. In those rare instances where a work stoppage has occurred, there has been no material effect on consolidated sales and earnings. We cannot predict, however, the outcome of future contract negotiations. In 2016, eight foreign collective-bargaining agreements and one U.S. collective-bargaining agreements will expire. These contracts affect about 15 percent of our foreign-based employees and five percent of our U.S employees.

Securities and Exchange Commission Filings

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings are available free of charge on our website, www.fmc.com. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are posted as soon as practicable after we furnish such materials to the SEC.

In accordance with New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules, on May 18, 2015, we filed a certification signed by our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) that, as of the date of the certification, he was unaware of any violation by FMC of the NYSE’s corporate governance listing standards. We also file with each Form 10-Q and our Form 10-K certifications by the CEO and Chief Financial Officer under sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Below lists our risk factors updated for these events.

Among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are:

Industry Risks:

Pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including:

•

Capacity utilization - Our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization. As a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within our industry.

•

Competition - All of our segments face competition, which could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position. Competition for our FMC Agricultural Solutions business, includes not only generic suppliers of the same pesticidal active ingredients, but also alternative proprietary pesticide chemistries, and crop protection technologies that are bred into or applied onto seeds. Increased generic presence in agricultural



chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade, and this trend is expected to continue.

•

Changes in our customer base - Our customer base has the potential to change, especially when long-term supply contracts are renegotiated. Our FMC Lithium and FMC Health and Nutrition businesses are most sensitive to this risk.

•

Climatic conditions - Our FMC Agricultural Solutions markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations. Adverse weather conditions can impact our ability to extract lithium efficiently from our lithium reserves in Argentina. Natural disasters can impact production at our facilities in various parts of the world. The nature of these events makes them difficult to predict.

•

Changing regulatory environment - Changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the United States, Brazil, China, Argentina and the European Union, could adversely impact our ability to continue producing and/or selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets or could increase the cost of doing so. Our FMC Agricultural Solutions business is most sensitive to this general regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products. Compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. In the European Union, the regulatory risk specifically includes chemicals regulation known as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals), which affects each of our business segments to varying degrees. The fundamental principle behind the REACH regulation is that manufacturers must verify through a special registration system that their chemicals can be marketed safely

.

•

Geographic concentration - Although we have operations in most regions, the majority of our FMC Agricultural Solutions sales outside the United States have principally been to customers in Latin America, including Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. With the acquisition of Cheminova, we are expanding our international sales, particularly in Europe and key Asian countries such as India. Accordingly, developments in those parts of the world will generally have a more significant effect on our operations. Our operations outside the United States are subject to special risks and restrictions, including: fluctuations in currency values; exchange control regulations; changes in local political or economic conditions; governmental pricing directives; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy; restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds; and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad.

•

Food and pharmaceutical regulation - Some of our manufacturing processes and facilities, as well as some of our customers, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or similar foreign agencies. Regulatory requirements of the FDA are complex, and any failure to comply with them including as a result of contamination due to acts of sabotage could subject us and/or our customers to fines, injunctions, civil penalties, lawsuits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial of government approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution. Any of these actions could adversely impact our net sales, undermine goodwill established with our customers, damage commercial prospects for our products and materially adversely affect our results of operations.

•

Climate change regulation - Changes in the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject our manufacturing operations to significant additional costs or limits on operations.

•

Fluctuations in commodity prices - Our operating results could be significantly affected by the cost of commodities such as raw materials and energy, including natural gas. We may not be able to raise prices or improve productivity sufficiently to offset future increases in commodity pricing. Accordingly, increases in commodity prices may negatively affect our financial results. Where practical, we use hedging strategies to address material commodity price risks, where hedge strategies are available on reasonable terms. We also use raw material supply agreements that contain terms designed to mitigate the risk of short-term changes in commodity prices. However, we are unable to avoid the risk of medium- and long-term increases. Additionally, fluctuations in commodity prices could negatively impact our customers' ability to sell their products at previously forecasted prices resulting in reduced customer liquidity. Inadequate customer liquidity could affect our customers’ abilities to pay for our products and, therefore, affect existing and future sales or our ability to collect on customer receivables.

•

Supply arrangements - Certain raw materials are critical to our production process. While we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements, an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or operate under contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products. We increasingly source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers. An inability to obtain these products or execute under contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products. In FMC Lithium, geological conditions can affect production of raw materials.

•

Economic and political change - Our business has been and could continue be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including: inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the United States or any of the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in laws, taxation, and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws, taxes, and regulations; restrictions imposed by foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy; nationalization or



expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights, and legal systems or political instability; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control. Economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. In Argentina, continued inflation and tightening of foreign exchange controls along with deteriorating economic and financial conditions could adversely affect our business. In Brazil, which makes up a larger portion of our Agricultural Solutions business in Latin America since our acquisition of Cheminova in the second quarter of 2015, continued high inflation and economic recession could continue to adversely affect our business.

Operational Risks:

•

Market access risk - Our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels, which could impact our ability to access the market.

•

Business disruptions - Although more recently, FMC Agricultural Solutions has engaged in pesticide active ingredient contract manufacturing rather than owned and operated FMC own manufacturing facilities, Cheminova owns and operates large-scale manufacturing facilities in Denmark and India. This will present us with additional operating risks, in that  our operating results will be dependent in part on the continued operation of the various acquired production facilities and the ability to manufacture products on schedule.  Interruptions at these facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, or our business as a whole, during and after the period of such operational difficulties. Although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. These potential hazards include explosions, fires, severe weather and natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtimes, supplier disruptions, labor shortages or other labor difficulties,  information technology systems outages, disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations, transportation interruptions, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, shipment of incorrect or off-specification product to customers, storage tank leaks, other environmental risks, or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, pandemic situations and large scale power outages. Some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities.

•

Information technology security risks - As with all enterprise information systems, our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. Our systems have in the past been, and likely will in the future be, subject to unauthorized access attempts. Unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in failures or interruptions in our computer systems and in the loss of assets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, breaches of our security measures or the accidental  loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the company, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, could result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

•

Capital-intensive business - With the acquisition of Cheminova, our business is more capital intensive than it has been historically. We rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs. Limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results. Moreover, interest payments, dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. We believe that our cash from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet these needs in the foreseeable future. However, if we need external financing, our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital will be dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally. There can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain equity or debt financing on terms we deem acceptable, and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities, which could adversely affect our operating results.

•

We may use our existing revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs, to the extent available. In the event of a default  this credit facility or any of our senior notes, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. Any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. Without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate.

•

Litigation and environmental risks - Current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate.



•

Hazardous materials - We manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature. While we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into the environment, they could cause property damage or result in personal injury claims against us.

•

Environmental Compliance - We are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws. regulations, directives, rules and ordinances concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land and water, and the generation, handling, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous waste and other materials. We may face liability arising out of the normal course of business, including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture, handle or own. We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

•

Inability to attract and retain key employees - The inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. In addition, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management and other key members of the organization.

Technology Risks:

•

Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers.

•

Failure to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs could impede our competitive position.

•

Some of our competitors may secure patents on production methods or uses of products that may limit our ability to compete cost-effectively.

Portfolio Management Risks:

•

We continuously review our portfolio which includes the evaluation of potential business acquisitions that may strategically fit our business and strategic growth initiatives. If we are unable to successfully integrate and develop our acquired businesses, we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies which would include expected cost savings and revenue growth. Failure to achieve these anticipated synergies, could materially and adversely affect our financial results. In addition to strategic acquisitions we evaluate the diversity of our portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with our growth strategy. In implementing this strategy we may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets. The gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets (e.g., divesting) may affect the company’s earnings. Moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce earnings.

In particular, an inability to successfully integrate and develop Cheminova as planned could result in our inability to achieve the synergies we have projected and could thereby cause our future results of operations to be materially and adversely worse than expected. We expect to generate synergies as a result of i) improving Cheminova operating cost-efficiencies, ii) changing the mix of Cheminova’s sales from generic, lower margin products to more differentiated and higher margin products, and iii) rationalizing of the distribution channels used by FMC and Cheminova in overlapping European markets. However, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in achieving these planned synergies.

Financial Risks:

•

Deterioration in the global economy and worldwide credit and foreign exchange markets could adversely affect our business. A worsening of global or regional economic conditions or financial markets could adversely affect our customers ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers ability to perform all their commitments to us. A slowdown in economic growth in our international markets, particularly Latin American regions, or a deterioration of credit or foreign exchange markets could adversely affect customers, suppliers and our overall business there. Customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products, or it could become more expensive for them to purchase imported products in their local currency, or sell their commodities at prevailing international prices, and we may be unable to collect receivables from such customers. The ongoing economic recession in Brazil has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business there.

•

We are an international company and face foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of our business. We are particularly sensitive to the Brazilian real, the euro, the Argentine peso and the Chinese yuan. To a lesser extent, we are sensitive to the Mexican peso, the British pound sterling and several Asian currencies. Our acquisition of Cheminova has significantly expanded our operations and sales in foreign countries and correspondingly increased our exposure to foreign exchange risks. During 2015, adverse changes in the Brazilian real exchange rate adversely impacted our financial results and continued weakness in the real could continue to adversely impact our financial results.



•

Our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including: a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions, as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at more favorable rates than the United States federal statutory rate; accounting for uncertain tax positions; business combinations; expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits; changes in valuation allowance; changes in tax law; and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which United States taxes have not been previously accrued.

•

We have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities.

•

Obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. To the extent our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly.

PROPERTIES

FMC leases executive offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and operates 32 manufacturing facilities and mines in 19 countries. Our major research and development facilities are in Ewing, New Jersey and Shanghai, China.

We have long-term mineral rights to the Salar del Hombre Muerto lithium reserves in Argentina. Our FMC Lithium division requires the lithium brine that is mined from these reserves, without which other sources of raw materials would have to be obtained.

We believe our facilities are in good operating conditions. The number and location of our owned or leased production properties for continuing operations are:

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Like hundreds of other industrial companies, we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestos-related personal injury litigation. Most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of FMC or to asbestos-containing components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations. The machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestos-containing component parts at issue in the litigation, and to this day, neither the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration nor the Environmental Protection Agency has banned the use of these components. Further, the asbestos-containing parts for this machinery and equipment were accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance. A few jurisdictions have permitted claims to proceed against equipment manufacturers relating to insulation installed by other companies on such machinery and equipment. We believe that, overall, the claims against FMC are without merit.

As of

December 31, 2015

, there were approximately 8,000 premises and product asbestos claims pending against FMC in several jurisdictions. Since the 1980s, approximately 111,000 asbestos claims against FMC have been discharged, the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the claimant. Since the 1980s, settlements with claimants have totaled approximately $73.1 million.

We intend to continue managing these asbestos-related cases in accordance with our historical experience. We have established a reserve for this litigation within our discontinued operations and believe that any exposure of a loss in excess of the established reserve cannot be reasonably estimated. Our experience has been that the overall trends in asbestos litigation have changed over time. Over the last several years, we have seen changes in the jurisdictions where claims against FMC are being filed and changes in the mix of products named in the various claims. Because these claim trends have yet to form a predictable pattern, we are presently unable to reasonably estimate our asbestos liability with respect to claims that may be filed in the future.



See Note 1 “Principal Accounting Policies and Related Financial Information—Environmental Obligations,” Note 10 “Environmental Obligations” and Note 18 “Guarantees, Commitments and Contingencies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, the content of which are incorporated by reference to this Item 3.

In September 2015, EPA Region 3 filed an administrative complaint against the Company, claiming that certain advertising and labeling regarding one of our pesticide products did not comply with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”) and has calculated a proposed penalty in excess of $100,000.  We disagree with EPA on whether a violation occurred and, if a violation did occur, the appropriate penalty calculation, and will defend ourselves vigorously.   We do not expect that any penalty associated with final judgment or other resolution would be material.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural, consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions, applications and market-leading products. We operate in three distinct business segments: FMC Agricultural Solutions, FMC Health and Nutrition and FMC Lithium. Our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment develops, markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals – insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. These products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects, weeds and disease, as well as in non-agricultural markets for pest control. The FMC Health and Nutrition segment focuses on nutritional ingredients, health excipients, and functional health ingredients. Nutritional ingredients are used to enhance texture, color, structure and physical stability. Health excipients are used for binding, encapsulation and disintegrant applications. Functional health ingredients are  used as active ingredients in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical markets. Our FMC Lithium segment manufactures lithium for use in a wide range of lithium products, which are used primarily in energy storage, specialty polymers and chemical synthesis application.

2015 Highlights

The following are the more significant developments in our businesses during the year ended

December 31, 2015

:

•

Revenue of

$3,276.5 million

in


increased $17.8 million or one percent versus last year. The increase in revenue was attributable to FMC Agricultural Solutions as a result of additional revenue from the acquisition of Cheminova.  This was offset by significant unfavorable currency impacts, primarily in our Agricultural Solutions segment within Brazil.  A more detailed review of revenues by segment is included under the section entitled

“Results of Operations”

. On a regional basis, sales in Latin America decreased by18 percent, sales in North America were relatively flat, sales in Asia were up 13 percent and sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) increased by 29 percent.

•

Our gross margin, excluding acquisition-related charges, of $1,133.2 million decreased approximately $82 million or approximately seven percent versus last year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue is approximately 34.5 percent versus 37.3 percent in 2014. The reduction in gross margin was due to lower volumes in Brazil within FMC Agricultural Solutions and unfavorable currency impact and product mix. The gross margin percentage decline was impacted by the same factors.

•

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 25 percent from $589.8 million to $737.9 million primarily related to acquisition related charges. Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding non-operating pension and postretirement charges and acquisition-related charges, of $470.1 million increased $22.6 million or approximately five percent. The increased was driven primarily by the addition of the Cheminova acquisition. Non-operating pension and postretirement charges and acquisition-related charges are presented in our Adjusted Earnings Non-GAAP financial measurement below under the section titled

“Results of Operations”

.

•

Research and Development expenses of

$143.7 million

increased $17.4 million or 13.8 percent.

•

Adjusted earnings after-tax from continuing operations attributable to FMC stockholders of $332.6 million decreased approximately $94 million or 22 percent due to lower results in the FMC Agricultural Solutions primarily within Brazil. See the disclosure of our Adjusted Earnings Non-GAAP financial measurement below under the section titled

“Results of Operations”

.

•

During 2015, we incurred significant restructuring and other charges. The increase was primarily the result of charges associated with the integration of Cheminova as well as charges within Health and Nutrition associated with the mothballing of Seal Sands facility in the UK. Charges associated with the integration of Cheminova also included the loss on sale of $64.5 million associated with the sale of our generic crop protection business in Brazil.

Other 2015 Highlights

During 2015, we closed on two significant transactions - the divestiture of our Alkali Chemicals division and the acquisition of Cheminova.  This marked the completion of our transformation to a technology-driven specialty company with leading market positions across agriculture, nutrition, pharmaceutical and specialty lithium applications.

In Agricultural Solutions, the acquisition of Cheminova strengthened our technology pipeline, brought greater regional balance, broadened our market access and expanded our portfolio.  The acquisition and integration of Cheminova combined with the actions we have taken to restructure our Agricultural Solutions operations in Brazil have positioned FMC to better address current market conditions.



In Health and Nutrition, we focused on driving higher margins by capturing high-value commercial opportunities across our existing portfolio and by the implementation of Manufacturing Excellence programs and process technology improvements.  And in Lithium, we continued to execute on our strategy of growing our differentiated, downstream specialty business to take advantage of favorable end market demand.

Finally, 2015 was also a year marked by significant foreign exchange volatility which impacted our results negatively as well as difficult conditions across the global agriculture market.  To address this, we took decisive actions throughout the year to address these challenges which included accelerating the integration of Cheminova, restructuring our Agricultural Solutions business in Brazil, exercising discipline on pricing and aggressively controlling costs across the Company.

2016 Outlook

We expect to deliver earnings growth in all businesses in 2016, and will continue to position FMC firmly on the path of growth by leveraging the company’s unique business model that has defined our success.  We remain a technology-driven company with low-cost asset light operations, a unique business research and development model that balances short-and mid-term development with long-term innovation, and global scale with strong regional expertise to support local customers.

Please see segment discussions under the section entitled

“Results of Operations”

for 2016 outlook for each segment.  On a consolidated basis we expect our 2016 adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.50 and $2.80.



Results of Operations—


,


and


Overview

The following presents a reconciliation of our segment operating profit to the net income attributable to FMC stockholders as seen through the eyes of our management. For management purposes, we report the operating performance of each of our business segments based on earnings before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expenses, other income (expense), net and corporate special income/(charges).

____________________

(1)

See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K for details of restructuring and other (charges) income by segment:

(2)

Our non-operating pension and postretirement costs are defined as those costs related to interest, expected return on plan assets,

amortized actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements. These costs are primarily related

to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and we consider these costs to be outside our operational performance. We exclude these non-operating pension and postretirement costs from our segments as we believe that removing them provides a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our businesses, provides increased transparency and clarity in the performance of our retirement plans and enhances period-over-period comparability. We continue to include the service cost and amortization of prior service cost in our operating segments noted above. We believe these elements reflect the current year operating costs to our businesses for the employment benefits provided to active employees.

(3)    Charges are associated with the previously planned separation of our FMC Corporation into two independent public companies. On



September 8, 2014, we announced that we would no longer proceed with the planned separation. At that time we announced the acquisition of Cheminova. See Note 3 within these consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K for more information. These charges are included within "Business separation costs" on our consolidated income statement. These costs were primarily related to professional fees associated with separation activities within the finance and legal functions through September 8, 2014.

(4)     Charges related to the expensing of the inventory fair value step-up resulting from the application of acquisition purchase accounting,

legal and professional fees and gains or losses on hedging purchase price associated with the planned or completed acquisitions. See Note 3 for details.

Amounts represent the following:

(a)

On the consolidated statements of income, these charges are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses.”

(b)

On the consolidated statements of income, these charges are included in “Costs of sales and services.”

ADJUSTED EARNINGS RECONCILIATION

The following chart, which is provided to assist the readers of our financial statements, depicts certain after-tax charges (gains). These items are excluded from the measures we use to evaluate business performance and determine certain performance-based compensation. These after-tax items are discussed in detail within the “Other results of operations” section that follows. Additionally, the chart below discloses our Non-GAAP financial measure “Adjusted after-tax earnings from continuing operations attributable to FMC stockholders” reconciled from the GAAP financial measure “Net income (loss) attributable to FMC stockholders.” We believe that this measure provides useful information about our operating results to investors. We also believe that excluding the effect of restructuring and other income and charges, non-operating pension and postretirement charges, certain Non-GAAP tax adjustments from operating results and discontinued operations allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period. This measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP.

____________________

(1)

We exclude the GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from the Non-GAAP measure of income, and instead include a Non-GAAP tax provision based upon the annual Non-GAAP effective tax rate. The GAAP tax provision includes certain discrete tax items including, but are not limited to: income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to ongoing business operations in the current year; unusual or infrequently occurring items; tax adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency remeasurement of certain foreign operations; certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years; certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets; and changes in tax law. Management believes excluding these discrete tax items assists investors and securities analysts in understanding the t



ax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations thereby providing investors with useful supplemental information about FMC's operational performance.

In the discussion below, please refer to our chart titled

"Segment Results Reconciliation"

within the Results of Operations section. All comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted.

Segment Results

For management purposes, segment operating profit is defined as segment revenue less segment operating expenses (segment operating expenses consist of costs of sales and services, selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") and research and development expenses ("R&D"). We have excluded the following items from segment operating profit: corporate staff expense, interest income and expense associated with corporate debt facilities and investments, income taxes, gains (or losses) on divestitures of businesses, restructuring and other charges (income), non-operating pension and postretirement charges, investment gains and losses, loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairments, Last-in, First-out (“LIFO”) inventory adjustments, acquisition/divestiture related charges, business separation costs and other income and expense items.

Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

FMC Agricultural Solutions


vs.


Revenue of

$2,252.9 million

increased approximately four percent versus the prior year period due to revenue from the Cheminova acquisition on April 20, 2015.

Operating profit of

$363.9 million

decreased approximately 27 percent compared to the year-ago period. This decline was primarily driven by market conditions and currency movements in Brazil.

Refer to the

FMC Agricultural Solutions Pro Forma Financial Results with Cheminova

section below for further discussion.

For 2016, full-year segment revenue is expected to be approximately $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion and full-year segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $380 million to $420 million. In Europe, we expect our key markets to be broadly flat compared to last year, although we expect to see higher growth across Eastern Europe. In North America, we expect the challenging market conditions will continue in 2016 given elevated channel inventory levels and projected lower farm incomes. As a result, we expect the market in North America to be down in 2016. Across Asia, we expect the market to be mixed, depending on the country. However, overall, we expect the region to be up slightly in 2016 assuming more normal pest pressures and weather conditions. Finally, turning to Latin America, market conditions in Argentina, Mexico and Columbia are expected to remain favorable, with growth in weed resistant acres and increasing acreage of niche crops. We expect the market in Brazil to be down again in 2016. Channel inventory levels are expected to remain elevated in 2016. However, we expect to see an improvement in market fundamentals for sugarcane and cotton


vs.


Revenue of

$2,173.8 million

increased approximately one percent versus the prior year period due to higher sales in  North America,  Asia and EMEA offset by a decline in sales in Latin America.

Sales in Latin America of $1,120.7 million decreased five percent due to weak demand conditions in Brazil, particularly in sugarcane and cotton segments, as drought and lower planted area reduced herbicide and insecticide demand.  This was partially offset by growth in other Latin American countries such as Argentina and Mexico as FMC gained market share. Sales in North America of $560.2 million increased 11 percent primarily driven by strong demand for pre-emergent herbicides into soybeans and growth from new product introductions into various crop segments. Revenue in Asia of $343.6 million increased nine percent reflecting sales growth in Australia, Pakistan, Korea and China. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) increased seven percent to $149.3 million primarily due to higher herbicide volumes.



FMC Agricultural Solutions' operating profit of

$497.8 million

decreased approximately eight percent compared to the year-ago period, reflecting relatively flat sales, unfavorable currency impacts, increases to SG&A as well as additional planned R&D investments and changes in product mix. SG&A costs were approximately $2 million higher and R&D costs were approximately $12 million higher than the prior year period with spending on marketing, sales and technology investments.

FMC Agricultural Solutions Pro Forma Financial Results with Cheminova

In the second quarter of 2015 we began to present pro forma combined results for the FMC Agricultural Solutions segment for 2015 and 2014. We believe that reviewing our operating results by combining actual and pro forma results for the FMC Agricultural Solutions segment for 2015 and 2014 is more useful in identifying trends in, or reaching conclusions regarding, the overall operating performance of this segment. Our pro forma segment information will include adjustments as if the Cheminova transaction had occurred on January 1, 2014. Our pro forma data will also be adjusted for the effects of acquisition accounting but will not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that might be achieved by the combined businesses. Pro forma amounts to be presented will not necessarily be indicative of what our results would have been had we operated Cheminova since January 1, 2014, nor our future results. We believe that reviewing our operating results by combining actual and pro forma results for the FMC Agricultural Solutions segment for these interim periods is more useful in identifying trends in, or reaching conclusions regarding, the overall operating performance of the segment.

Pro Forma Combined Results - 2015 vs. 2014

Pro Forma combined revenue of

$2,614.9 million

decreased approximately 23 percent versus the prior year period. Favorable pricing impacted revenue by five percent in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014; however, the price increases only partially offset the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements and lower volumes.  Unfavorable currency negatively impacted revenue by 11 percent while volumes impacted revenue by 16 percent. Most of this decline was experienced in Latin America, primarily Brazil.  Lower volume was also a result of of the deliberate action to reduce third party resales also in Brazil. These reduced third party sales were partially the result of the sale of our Consagro business.

Pro forma combined operating profit of

$383.8 million

decreased approximately 28 percent compared to the year-ago period. The significant movement in foreign currency rates compared to last year, particularly the real, was the main driver of the decline in operating profit as price increases in local currencies were not enough to offset the impact of foreign currency.  During 2015, the Brazilian real depreciated significantly versus the U.S. dollar.  As a result, foreign currency contributed 55% to the decline in year over year pro forma combined operating profit while to a lesser extent lower volumes contributed to a 16 percent impact. Higher pricing and mix partially offset these declines by 23 percent while lower costs primarily selling, general and administrative combined with lower research and development costs improved profits year over year by 19 percent.  These lower costs were driven by cost savings driven by synergies associated with the Cheminova acquisition as well as reduced spending primarily in Brazil to address with near-term market conditions.

During the year, we announced several targeted measures to reduce operating costs and reorganize our operations in Brazil to align the business with near-term market conditions.  These measures included:

•

Enhancing our focus on proprietary technology platforms and differentiated products, and rationalizing our product offerings to eliminate low-margin sales. This portfolio rationalization program, including the sale of our generic subsidiary, Consagro, reduced 2015 proforma combined operating profit by $48 million compared to 2014. This will enable us to further reduce the region's operating costs and enhance our potential to deliver higher future earnings and return on capital. At the completion of this reorganization, FMC's workforce in Brazil will be approximately half its size compared to 2014. All of these actions were substantially completed by December 31, 2015.

•

The Cheminova integration continues to  be accelerated and additional programs to achieve further cost savings are being implemented.

Certain Regulatory Issues

In late December 2015, the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) issued a Technical Note recommending banning of carbofuran as a registered pesticide in Brazil. We disagree with ANVISA’s assessment of carbofuran and its regulatory recommendation. Under the Brazilian regulatory process, FMC and other interested persons may submit, in response to the Technical Note, comments and data for consideration by ANVISA as well as the Brazilian Ministries of Agriculture and Environment. Any final decision regarding the continued registration of carbofuran will require concurrence of all three government agencies before the regulatory action is effective. We are preparing, and will submit, information in support of carbofuran for consideration by the government agencies. The agencies will issue their decision after consideration of all submitted information. We do not expect any material sales impact due to this regulatory review in Brazil during 2016.

We intend to defend vigorously all our products in the U.S., EU and other countries as our pesticide products are reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2016 as part of the ongoing cycle of re-registration of our pesticide products around the world.

FMC Health and Nutrition


vs.


Revenue was

$785.5 million

, a decrease of approximately five percent versus the prior-year period. Unfavorable foreign currency impacts, primarily a weaker euro, decreased revenue by approximately five percent with volume, price and mix flat in the aggregate compared to prior year. Volume was slightly positive as lower volume in carrageenan and alginates



were offset by growth in the MCC family of products in both pharmaceuticals and food end markets. Pricing for 2015 as compared to 2014 was slightly positive and mix was slightly negative.

Segment operating profit of

$194.7 million

increased approximately four percent versus the year ago period driven by the higher volumes discussed in the preceding paragraph, the operating profit impact of improved price and mix and lower manufacturing costs as well as lower selling, general and administrative costs, partially offset by unfavorable currency. Volumes and price mix improved operating profit by three percent and two percent, respectively while lower manufacturing costs and lower selling, general and administrative costs improved profits by two percent and three percent, respectively. The reduction in these costs was driven by various manufacturing initiatives to improve profitability as well as the benefits of restructuring activities and cost control initiatives. Finally, unfavorable currency negatively impacted results by six percent year over year.

Segment revenue for the full year of 2016 is anticipated to be approximately $775 million to $825 million, while full-year segment earnings are expected to be between $198 million and $208 million. Earnings growth in 2016 is expected to be driven primarily by the benefits of operational improvements, along with continued growth in demand for excipients and nutritional products across emerging markets.


vs.


Revenue was

$828.2 million

, an increase of approximately nine percent versus the prior-year period. Revenue from higher volumes in health markets, including acquisitions completed in 2013, and higher volumes in overall nutrition markets increased sales by approximately six percent and two percent, respectively. Favorable pricing and mix, primarily in nutrition-related products increased sales by one percent.

Segment operating profit of

$187.9 million

increased by 11 percent versus the prior-year period driven by higher demand for pharmaceutical excipients and texture and stability products in North America. These were slightly offset by increased raw material costs, particularly seaweed, and reduced demand for nutrition products into the Chinese beverage market.

FMC Lithium


vs.


Revenue of

$238.1 million

decreased by approximately seven percent versus the prior-year period driven by lower volumes of upstream products and weaker foreign currencies. These impacted revenues by seven percent and three percent, respectively. This was partially offset by favorable pricing which impacted revenue by three percent.

Segment operating profit of

$23.0 million

decreased approximately 15 percent versus the year ago period. Pricing impacted operating profit favorably by approximately $7 million while volume had about an equal negative impact on operating profit.  Foreign currency, primarily the Argentine peso and the euro, impacted operating profit by approximately $9 million. This was partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and other miscellaneous items.

Demand for lithium remains strong and pricing trends continue to be favorable. Full year segment revenue is expected to be approximately $240 to 260 million while segment operating profit is expected to be  between $33 and $43 million for the full year of 2016, an increase of 65 percent over 2015 at the mid-point of the range.


vs.


Lithium revenues of

$256.7 million

increased 15 percent compared to the prior year. Higher production volume that allowed for additional sales, particularly for energy storage applications, contributed a 19 percent increase in revenue This was partially offset by lower pricing which negatively impacted revenues by four percent.

Segment operating profit of

$27.2 million

increased approximately 103 percent versus the prior year. Operating profit was driven by higher volumes. The increase was partially offset by unfavorable currency and operating costs associated with our Argentine operations.

Corporate and other

Corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item “Selling, general and administrative expenses” except for last in, first-out (LIFO) related charges that are included as a component of "Cost of sales and other services" on our consolidated statements of income.




vs.


Corporate and other expenses of

$62.4 million

decreased by $9.0 million from

$71.4 million

in the same period in


.  The decrease is driven primarily by reduced LIFO inventory expense of approximately $7 million.  The reduced LIFO expense was driven by lower inflation rates applied to the inventory subject to LIFO calculations.  Excluding the LIFO reductions, corporate staff expenses and incentive payments were flat year over year.


vs.


Corporate and other expenses of

$71.4 million

decreased by $11.0 million from

82.4 million

in the same period in 2013. The decrease period over period is primarily due to a decrease of $5.1 million in employees' incentive accruals and a decrease of $4.6 million in pension service charges. Reduced pension service charges are primarily driven by the higher discount rate used to calculate the 2014 expense.

Interest expense, net


vs.


Interest expense, net of

$80.1 million

increased  by approximately 56 percent compared to

$51.2 million

in 2014. The increase was primarily due to our borrowings under our senior unsecured Term Loan facility. The proceeds of these borrowings were used to finance the acquisition of Cheminova as well as to pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and the term loan facility. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information.


vs.


Interest expense, net for 2014 of

$51.2 million

increased approximately 41 percent as compared to 2013 of

$36.3 million

. The increase is primarily driven by the issuance of $400 million in Senior Notes in November 2013. The $400 million debt issuance, with an interest rate of 4.10 percent, was use to fund the acquisition of Epax and working capital requirements of our businesses.

Corporate special (charges) income

Restructuring and other (charges) income

Our restructuring and other (charges) income are comprised of restructuring, assets disposals and other charges (income) as described below:


Restructuring and asset disposal charges in


totaled

$244.0 million

. Included in this were significant charges totaling $118.3 million associated with the Cheminova restructuring that was implemented as part of the integration of Cheminova into our existing FMC Agricultural Solutions segment. The Cheminova charges included those associated with the sale of Consagro, which amounted to $64.5 million. Restructuring and asset disposal charges also include charges associated with various activities in Health and Nutrition of $93.6 million.  The majority of these charges, are from the loss on sale of our Pectin business of $12 million as well as asset write downs associated with the mothballing of our Seal Sands plant equaling $70.5 million. The Seal Sands plant, in the UK, was mothballed in 2015 due to a lack of demand for the Omega-3 pharmaceuticals products that were manufactured at that facility.

Other charges (income) net in 2015 consisted of environmental charges of  $21.7 million, the impacts of the Argentina currency devaluation in December of 2015 of $10.7 million, and $20.5 million of expenses associated with acquired in-process research and development activity.  Partially offsetting these amounts was a gain of $26.6 million related to the sale of our remaining ownership interest in a Belgian-based pesticide distribution company, Belchim Crop Protection N.V. ("Belchim"). See Note 7 within the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information.




Restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2014 of

$17.2 million

were primarily associated with our Health and Nutrition restructuring as well as other miscellaneous exit costs. Other charges (income) net in 2014 of

$39.2 million

were primarily related to corporate environmental charges of $43.7 million and charges of $22.1 million associated with our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment which entered into collaboration and license agreements with various third-party companies for the purpose of obtaining certain technology and intellectual property rights relating to new compounds still under development. Offsetting these charges is income from the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in a pesticide distribution company which resulted in a gain on the sale of approximately $26.6 million.


Restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2013 of $12.2 million were primarily associated with the announced Lithium restructuring. Other charges (income) net in 2013 of $38.3 million primarily related to charges associated with collaboration and license agreements entered into by our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment for the purpose of obtaining certain technology and intellectual property rights relating to new compounds still under development. The rights and technology obtained is referred to as in-process research and development and in accordance with GAAP, the amounts paid were expensed as incurred since they were acquired outside of a business combination.

Non-operating pension and postretirement (charges) income

Non-operating pension and postretirement (charges) income are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statements of income (loss).


vs.


The charge for 2015 was

$35.3 million

compared to

$10.5 million

for 2014. The increase in charges was primarily the result of $24.1 million of higher amortization of net actuarial losses. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information.


vs.


The charge for 2014 was

$10.5 million

compared to

$38.1 million

for 2013. The decrease in charges was primarily attributable to lower amortization of net actuarial losses of $21.1 million compared to 2013.

Business Separation costs

On September 8, 2014, we announced that we would no longer proceed with the planned separation as a result of the planned acquisition of Cheminova and divestiture of FMC Alkali Chemicals division. As a result there were no business separation charges in 2015.  Business separation cost for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 represent charges associated with the planned separation activities through December 31, 2015.

Acquisition-related charges

A detailed description of the acquisition related charges is included in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K and in the Segment Results Reconciliation above within the "

Results of Operations

" section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis.

Provision for income taxes

A significant amount of our earnings is generated by our foreign subsidiaries (e.g. Denmark, Ireland and Hong Kong), which tax earnings at lower rates than the United States federal statutory rate. Our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including: a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions, as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at more favorable rates than the United States federal statutory rate; accounting for uncertain tax positions; business combinations; closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits; changes in valuation allowance; changes in tax law; and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which United States taxes have not been previously accrued.



_______________

(1)     Tax adjustments in 2015 were primarily associated with valuation allowance adjustments taken in our Brazil subsidiaries.  Tax

adjustments in 2014 were primarily associated with revisions to our tax liabilities associated with prior year tax matters. Tax adjustments in 2013 were primarily associated with adjustments to U.S. state deferred tax balances established prior to 2013 driven by a change in enacted tax rates and other state related items.

The primary drivers for the fluctuations in the effective tax rate from 2013 to 2015 are provided in the table above. Excluding the items in the table above, the change in the effective tax rates from 2013 to 2015 was primarily due to a shift in earnings mix as it relates to domestic versus foreign income. Foreign profits are generally taxed at lower rates compared to domestic income. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the provisions for income taxes on continuing operations, as well as items that significantly impact our effective tax rate.

Discontinued operations, net of income taxes

Our discontinued operations represent our discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals and FMC Peroxygens divisions' results as well as adjustments to retained liabilities from other previously discontinued operations. The primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities, other postretirement benefit liabilities, self-insurance, long-term obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities.


vs.


Discontinued operations, net of income taxes represented a gain of

$676.4 million

in 2015 compared to a gain of

$14.5 million

in 2014. The change was driven by the divestiture of our discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals division which resulted in an after tax gain of $

702.1 million

in 2015.


vs.


Discontinued operations, net of income taxes represented a gain of

$14.5 million

for

December 31, 2014

, compared to a loss of

$63.6 million

for 2013. The change is primarily the result of a charges of $156.7 million ($122.1 million after-tax) in 2013 associated with our discontinued FMC Peroxygens segment.  A large portion of the 2013 charge was associated with a write-down of the Peroxygen assets held for sale to fair value.  See Note 9 within our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information.

Net income attributable to FMC stockholders


vs.


Net income attributable to FMC stockholders increased to

$489.0 million

from

$307.5 million

. The increase was primarily

due to the gain from the sale of our discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals division offset by reduced Agricultural Solutions results as well as higher interest expense from higher debt levels needed to fund the Cheminova acquisition. Also significantly impacting results was a higher tax rate in 2015 primarily due to the increases in certain foreign valuation allowances against deferred tax assets.


vs.


Net income attributable to FMC stockholders increased to

$307.5 million

in 2014, from

$293.9 million

in 2014. The increase was driven by improvements in FMC Health and Nutrition and FMC Lithium segment operating profits, lower effective tax rate, lower non-operating pension and postretirement charges and reduced charges associated with discontinued operations. Mostly offsetting these improvements were costs associated with our previously planned business separation, the acquisition of Cheminova, the divestiture of our FMC Alkali Chemicals division, lower FMC Agricultural Solutions segment earnings and higher interest expense.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and cash equivalents at

December 31, 2015

and


, were

$78.6 million

and

$109.5 million

, respectively. Of the cash and cash equivalents balance at

December 31, 2015

, $71.6 million were held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to reinvest permanently the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore we have not recorded taxes that would be payable if we repatriated these earnings.

At

December 31, 2015

, we had total debt of

$2,148.9 million

as compared to

$1,664.1 million

at

December 31, 2014

. Total debt  included

$2,036.3 million

and

$1,138.9 million

of long-term debt (excluding current portions of

$1.5 million

and

$2.0 million

) at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively. As of

December 31, 2015

, we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants.  During 2016, the maximum leverage ratio will step down in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. Additionally, we will take a variety of steps, if necessary, to ensure compliance with the maximum leverage ratio at the applicable measurement dates. See Note 12 in the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further details.

The increase in long-term debt was due to borrowings of

$1.65 billion

under our senior unsecured Term Loan Facility. The proceeds of the borrowing were used to finance the acquisition of Cheminova as well as to pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and the term loan facility. At

December 31, 2015

,

$900.0 million

remained outstanding under the Term Loan facility, as a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of our FMC Alkali Chemicals division (see Note 9 in the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further details) was used to pay down the initial borrowings. The scheduled maturity of the Term Loan Facility is on April 21, 2020. The borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement will bear interest at a floating rate, which will be a base rate or a Eurocurrency rate equal to the London interbank offered rate for the relevant interest period, plus in each case an applicable margin, as determined in accordance with the provisions of the Term Loan Agreement. See Note 12 in the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-k for further details.

Our short-term debt, consists of foreign borrowings and our commercial paper program. Foreign borrowings increased from

$36.6 million

at

December 31, 2014

to

$87.2 million

at

December 31, 2015

while outstanding commercial paper decreased from

$486.6 million

to

$23.9 million

at

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively.

Our commercial paper program allows us to borrow at rates generally more favorable than those available under our credit facility. At

December 31, 2015

, the average effective interest rate on these borrowings was

0.70 percent

.



Statement of Cash Flows

Cash provided (required) by operating activities was

$(277.1) million

,

$284.9 million

and

$258.3 million

for


,


and


, respectively.

The table below presents the components of net cash provided by operating activities.

____________________

(1)

Represents the sum of corporate special charges and depreciation and amortization.

(2)

The change in cash flows related to trade receivables in


was primarily driven by reduced revenue growth in FMC Agricultural Solutions mostly related to Brazil as well as, to a lesser extent, timing of collections. Collection timing is more pronounced in our FMC Agricultural Solutions business where sales, particularly in Brazil, have terms significantly longer than the rest of our businesses. Additionally, timing of collection is impacted as amounts for both periods include carry-over balances remaining to be collected in Latin America, where collection periods are measured in months rather than weeks. In 2014 and 2013, the change is driven by revenue increases in all three of our segments as well as due to timing of payments.

(3)

The change in 2015 inventory levels is a result of inventory levels being adjusted to take into consideration the change in market conditions mostly in Agricultural Solutions. Inventory levels dropped in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to inventory management programs and lower 2014 FMC Agricultural Solutions sales.

(4)

The change in accounts payable in


is primarily due to timing of payments including inventory reductions activities across the company, particularly as we integrate Cheminova as well as  proactively adjusting inventory levels in light of current market conditions. The change in 2014 is consistent with the slightly drop in inventory levels at the end of 2014.

(5)

These rebates are associated with our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment in North America and Brazil and generally settle in the fourth quarter of each year. The changes year over year are primarily associated with the mix in sales eligible for rebates and incentives in


compared to


and timing of rebate payments.

(6)

The advance payments from customers represent advances from our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment customers.

(7)

Changes in all periods presented primarily represent timing of payments associated with all other operating assets and liabilities, including guarantees issued to vendors under our vendor finance program.

(8)

See Note 7 in our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further details.

(9)

Included in our results for each of the years presented are environmental charges for environmental remediation at our operating sites of  $

21.7 million

, $43.7 million  and $6.2 million, respectively. The amounts in


will be spent in future years. The amounts represent environmental remediation spending at our operating sites which were recorded against pre-existing reserves, net of recoveries.



(10)

Amounts include voluntary contributions to our U.S. defined benefit plan of $65 million, $50 million and $40 million, respectively. In


the amount also includes a lump-sum payout of approximately $5.3 million from our nonqualified pension plan.

(11)

Interest payments from 2014 to 2015 remained fairly constant. Interest payments in 2014 increased over the preceding year primarily due to interest payments under the $400 million of Senior Notes at an interest rate of 4.10%  that was issued in November 2013. There were no interest payments under these borrowings in 2013.

(12)

The significant increase in tax payments from 2014 to 2015 is the tax paid on the gain associated with the sale of the discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals division. The reduction in tax payments from 2013 to 2014 is due to a domestic prepaid tax balance at December 31, 2013 that was applied in first quarter of 2014, thereby reducing tax payments in 2014.

(13)

Amounts are presented as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows, from share-based compensation.

(14)

Represents payments for legal and professional fees associated with the Cheminova acquisition.  See also Note 3 to the financial statements including in the Form 10-K for more information.

Cash provided (required) by operating activities of discontinued operations was

$(80.6) million

,

$88.8 million

and

$70.4 million

for


,


and


, respectively.

The increase of cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations in 2015 is due primarily to divestiture costs associated with the sale of our discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals business on April 1, 2015.  Additionally 2014 and 2013 include a full year of positive cash flows associated with FMC Alkali while 2015 only includes one quarter’s worth due to sale date timing.

The increase in cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations in 2014 is due to reduced net spending associated with discontinued environmental remediation sites. This reduced spending was slightly offset by increased spending associated with our other discontinued reserve which primarily includes retained legal obligations.

Cash required by investing activities was

$1,285.5 million

,

$190.2 million

and

$565.3 million

for


,


and


, respectively.

The increase in spending during the

twelve

months ended

December 31, 2015

, as compared to the same period in


was due to the Cheminova acquisition on April 21, 2015 for an aggregate purchase price of

$1.2 billion

, excluding assumed net debt and hedged-related costs totaling

$0.6 billion

The decrease in spending in 2014, as compared to 2013 was primarily due to the Epax acquisition that was completed in the third quarter of 2013.

Cash provided (required) by investing activities of discontinued operations was

$1,634.3 million

,

$154.9 million

and

$(87.9) million

for


,


and


, respectively.

Cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2015 is directly associated with the sale of our discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals business. These proceeds totaled $1.64 billion. Cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2014 is directly associated with the sale of our discontinued FMC Peroxygens business which was completed on February 28, 2014. The proceeds from this sale was approximately $200 million.  Also included in these investing activities was capital expenditures of these same discontinued operations for historical periods up to the point of sale.  The decrease in these capital expenditures in 2015 was due to only one quarter’s worth of Alkali capital expenditures in 2015 compared to a full year’s in 2014.  The 2013 period included a full year of capital expenditures for both Alkali and FMC Peroxygens.

Cash provided (required) by financing activities was

$(16.7) million

,

$(349.9) million

and

$371.2 million

in


,


and


, respectively.


vs.


The change period over period in financing activities is primarily due to the

$1.65 billion

we borrowed under our previously announced senior unsecured Term Loan facility. The proceeds of the borrowing were used to finance the acquisition of Cheminova as well as to pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and the term loan facility.  Offsetting this borrowing in 2015 was repayments of long-term debt totaling $1.1 billion primarily due to repayments associated with acquired Cheminova long term debt. Additionally short term debt decreased $547 million in 2015 as compared to $140 million in 2014.  Additionally in 2014 we paid $98.7 million to noncontrolling interests (primarily to acquire the remaining ownership of our discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals division) as compared to zero such payments in 2015.


vs.


The change period over period in financing activities is primarily due to significantly lower short-term borrowings in 2014 compared to borrowings in 2013. In 2013, increased borrowings were approximately $889 million compared to repayments in 2014 of $171 million. Additionally during the year ended 2013 we paid approximately $367 million in share repurchases and $90 million to noncontrolling interests (primarily to acquire additional ownership of our discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals division) compared to approximately $103 million in combined payments in 2014.

2016 Outlook



In 2016, we expect a continued improvement in cash generation. In aggregate, we expect cash basis operating income to increase  driven by higher earnings and continued working capital improvements.  We also expect lower restructuring and acquisition related integration spending compared to 2015.  In 2015, the majority of our tax payments were associated with the taxes associated with the Alkali sale.  Excluding these tax payments, we expect higher cash taxes in 2016 as compared to 2015.

Other potential liquidity needs

Our cash needs for 2016, outside of the Cheminova related integration expenses, include operating cash requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled mandatory payments of long-term debt, dividend payments, contributions to our pension plans, environmental and asset retirement obligation spending and restructuring. We plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash, cash generated from operations, commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility. At

December 31, 2015

our remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility was

$1,422.4 million

(which reflects borrowings under our commercial paper program).

Projected 2016 capital expenditures and expenditures related to contract manufacturers are expected to approximate 2015 levels.

Projected 2016 spending includes approximately $53 million of net environmental remediation spending. This spending does not include expected spending on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities or expected spending for environmental compliance costs, which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves. Capital spending to expand, maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls, which may increase our spending for environmental controls over the foregoing projections.

Our U.S. Pension Plan assets decreased from $1,255.1 million at

December 31, 2014

to $1,204.6 million at

December 31, 2015

due primarily to additional contributions were more than offset by a decline in stock market performance. Our U.S. Pension Plan assets comprise approximately 95 percent of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K for details on how we develop our long-term rate of return assumptions. We made contributions of $65 million and $50 million in


and


, respectively, and intend to contribute $35 million in 2016. Our contributions in


, 2015 and our intended contribution in 2016 are all in excess of the minimum requirements. Our contributions in excess of the minimum requirement are done with the objective of reducing future funding volatility. We do not believe that the additional contribution in 2016 will have a material impact on our current and future liquidity needs. However, volatility of interest rates and equity returns may require greater contributions in the future.

During the year ended

December 31, 2015

, no shares were repurchased under the publicly announced repurchase program.  At

December 31, 2015

, $250 million remained unused under our Board-authorized repurchase program. This repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time. Shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. We also reacquire shares from time to time from employees in connections with vesting, exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans.

Dividends

On

January 21, 2016

, we paid dividends aggregating

$22.1 million

to our shareholders of record as of

December 31, 2015

. This amount is included in “Accrued and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet as of

December 31, 2015

. For the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


, we paid

$86.4 million

,

$78.1 million

and

$73.6 million

in dividends, respectively.

Commitments

We provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain FMC Agricultural Solutions customers, principally Brazilian customers, for their seasonal borrowing. The total of these guarantees was

$114.2 million

at

December 31, 2015

.  These guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates. Non-performance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation requiring us to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee. Based on our experience these types of guarantees have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or on our liquidity. Our expectation is that future payment or performance related to the non-performance of others is considered unlikely.

Short-term debt consisted of foreign credit lines and commercial paper at

December 31, 2015

and


. We provide parent-company guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries.

We continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property, plant and equipment that are no longer integral to our operating businesses. In connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures, we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities, including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale. Our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a



deductible, minimum claim amount or cap. As such, it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. If triggered, we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties. We have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees.

Our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows:

____________________

(1)

Excluding discounts.

(2)

Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our long-term debt obligations. We had $1.7 million of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at

December 31, 2015

. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at

December 31, 2015

. Variable rates are  determined by the market and will fluctuate over time.

Obligations associated with our Ewing, NJ and Shanghai, China research and technology centers.

(5)

Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and timing of the transaction. We have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where take-or-pay arrangements apply. Since the majority of the minimum obligations under these contracts are take-or-pay commitments over the life of the contract and not a year by year take-or-pay, the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts.

As of

December 31, 2015

, the liability for uncertain tax positions was

$97.1 million

. This liability is excluded from the table above. Additionally, accrued pension and other postretirement benefits and our environmental liabilities as recorded on our consolidated balance sheets are excluded from the table above. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and periods in which these liabilities might be paid.

Contingencies

See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

Climate Change

As a global corporate citizen, we are concerned about the consequences of climate change and will take prudent and cost effective actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere.

FMC is committed to doing its part to address climate change.  We have set 2025 goals that we will reduce both energy intensity and Green House Gas (GHG) intensity for our operations by 15% from the 2013 baseline year. In 2015 we divested our Alkali Chemical business which previously accounted for the majority of FMC’s global GHG emissions. The Alkali business is not included in the baseline or reduction targets for the 2025 goals.

But even as we take action to control the release of GHGs, additional warming is anticipated with effects on agricultural production, water availability, rising sea levels, increasingly severe weather events and a lack of biodiversity.  We continually assess our manufacturing sites worldwide for these risks and for opportunities to increase energy efficiency.  We are assessing sea level rise and storm surge at three of our plants that are within 4 meters of sea level to understand timing of potential impacts and response actions that may need to be taken.

In our product portfolio, we are improving existing products and developing new platforms and technologies that help reduce impacts of climate change. Beyond our products, FMC recognizes that energy consumption throughout our supply chain can impact climate change and product costs.  Therefore, we will actively work with our entire value chain -suppliers, contractors, and customers - to improve their energy efficiencies and to reduce their GHG emissions.

We continue to follow legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations. In December 2015, 195 Countries at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris reached an agreement



to reduce GHGs. It still remains to be seen how and when each of these countries will implement this agreement. The United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan (Plan) is the US’s centerpiece for meeting its Paris commitment.  Implementation of the Plan recently has been stayed by the United States Supreme Court pending appeals. The Plan gives states flexibility to craft their own programs, so the impact to FMC of the Plan, if implemented, is not estimable at this time. At this point our U.S. facilities are not subject to any state or regional greenhouse gas regulation that limits GHG emissions. Some of our foreign operations are subject to national or local energy management or climate change regulation, such as our plant in Denmark that is subject to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.  At present, that plant’s emissions are below its designated cap.

Future GHG regulatory requirements may result in increased costs of energy, additional capital costs for emissions control or new equipment, and/or costs associated with cap and trade or carbon taxes.  The costs of complying with possible future climate change requirements are difficult to estimate at this time.

Fair Value Measurements

See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional discussion surrounding our fair value measurements.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) . The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have described our accounting policies in Note 1 "Principal Accounting Policies and related Financial Information" to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with U.S. GAAP and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors.

Revenue recognition and trade receivables

We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, which is generally upon transfer of title. This transfer typically occurs either upon shipment to the customer or upon receipt by the customer. In all cases, we apply the following criteria in recognizing revenue: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Rebates due to customers are accrued as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded based on the contract terms.

We periodically enter into prepayment arrangements with customers, primarily in our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment, and receive advance payments for product to be delivered in future periods. These advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue and classified as “Advance payments from customers” on the consolidated balance sheet. Revenue associated with advance payments is recognized as shipments are made and title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer.

We record amounts billed for shipping and handling fees as revenue. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded as costs of sales and services. Amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements. We record a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority.

Trade receivables consist of amounts owed from customer sales and are recorded when revenue is recognized. The allowance for trade receivables represents our best estimate of the probable losses associated with potential customer defaults. In developing our allowance for trade receivables, we use a two stage process which includes calculating a general formula to develop an



allowance to appropriately address the uncertainty surrounding collection risk of our entire portfolio and specific allowances for customers where the risk of collection has been reasonably identified either due to liquidity constraints or disputes over contractual terms and conditions.

Our method of calculating the general formula consists of estimating the recoverability of trade receivables based on historical experience, current collection trends, and external business factors such as economic factors, including regional bankruptcy rates, and political factors. Our analysis of trade receivable collection risk is performed quarterly, and the allowance is adjusted accordingly.

We also hold financing receivables that represent long-term customer receivable balances related to past-due accounts which are not expected to be collected within the current year.  Our policy for the review of the allowance for these receivables is consistent with the discussion in the preceding paragraph above on trade receivables.  Therefore on an ongoing basis, we continue to evaluate the credit quality of our financing receivables utilizing aging of receivables, collection experience and write-offs, as well as existing economic conditions, to determine if an additional allowance is necessary

Environmental obligations and related recoveries

We provide for environmental-related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used.

Estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a Record of Decision (“ROD”), or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (“RI/FS”), or equivalent, that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies. Estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management, as well as by financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. The estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site  contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.

Our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and/or study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment. Such costs principally include, among other items, RI/FS, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, management costs, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. Estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites.

Included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation, maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans (OM&M). Such reserves are based on our best estimates for these OM&M plans. Over time we may incur OM&M costs in excess of these reserves. However, we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably estimate the period for which such OM&M plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation, as conditions at these environmental sites change over time. Such additional OM&M costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years.

Included in the environmental reserve balance, other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies, which we believe are probable of recovery.

Provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named Potentially Responsible Parties (“PRPs”) or other third parties. Such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values.

In calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves, we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and the analogous state laws on all PRPs and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other PRPs at each site to the extent possible. We have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. Although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of PRPs and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site-by-site basis. Our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. We believe that any recorded recoveries related to PRPs are realizable in all material respects. Recoveries are recorded as either an offset in “Environmental



liabilities, continuing and discontinued” or as “Other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with U.S. accounting literature.

See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations.

Impairments and valuation of long-lived assets

Our long-lived assets primarily include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in our valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates and discount rates. Although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.

We test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of our property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. In cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets, which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable. The estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices, volumes, costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time.

We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of each year, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would require reassessment of the recoverability of those assets. In performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting units, anticipated changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and cost factors such as raw material prices. Based on our assessment for


, we determined that no impairment charge to our continuing operations was required.

See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for charges associated with long-lived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves.

Pension and other postretirement benefits

We provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees. The costs (benefits) and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including interest (discount) rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees. The costs (benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, such as average retirement age, mortality, employee turnover, and plan participation. To the extent our plans’ actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans’ funding requirements, could increase or decrease. When actual results differ from our assumptions, the difference is typically recognized over future periods. In addition, the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs (benefits) in future periods.

In 2015, the Society of Actuaries released an updated mortality table projection scale for measurement of retirement program obligations. We adopted this updates in measuring the

December 31, 2015

U.S. defined benefit and post retirement obligations. Adoption of this new projection scale has decreased the benefit obligations at

December 31, 2015

by approximately $24 million. The effect of this adoption will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost beginning in 2016.

We use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market-related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five-year period. We use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements. The actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range, high or low, of the actual market value of assets, and is adjusted accordingly.

We select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date. In selecting a discount rate as of

December 31, 2015

, we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yield-curve provided by our actuary.  This yield-curve, when populated with projected cash flows that represent the expected timing and amount of our plans' benefit payments, produced an effective discount rate of 4.50



percent for our U.S. qualified plan, 3.72 percent for our U.S. nonqualified, and 3.97 percent for our U.S. other postretirement benefit plans.

The discount rates used at our

December 31, 2015

and


measurement dates for the U.S. qualified plan were

4.50 percent

and

4.15 percent

, respectively. The effect of the change in the discount rate from

4.15 percent

to

4.50 percent

at

December 31, 2015

resulted in a

$56.8 million

decrease to our  U.S. qualified pension benefit obligations. The effect of the change in the discount rate from

4.95 percent

at December 31, 2013 to

4.15 percent

at December 31, 2014 resulted in a

$11.1 million

increase to the


U.S. qualified pension expense.

The change in discount rate from 4.15 percent at December 31, 2014 to 4.50 percent at December 31, 2015 was attributable to an increase in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2014 and 2015 measurement dates. Using the December 31, 2014 yield curve, our U.S. qualified plan cash flows produced a single weighted-average discount rate of approximately 4.15 percent. Matching our U.S. qualified plan cash flows to a similarly constructed curve reflecting high-yielding bonds available as of December 31, 2015, resulted in a single weighted-average discount rate of approximately 4.50 percent.

Historically, we estimated the service cost and interest cost components of expense using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. On December 31, 2015, we changed the method we used to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost for our US defined benefit pension plans. We have elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.  We have made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost. The change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations. We have accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively starting in 2016.

In developing the assumption for the long-term rate of return on assets for our U.S. Plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on the assumption for long-term real returns by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately

8.7 percent

over the last 20 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors which are discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Our long-term rate of return for the fiscal year ended

December 31, 2015

, was

7.25 percent

and for years ending December 31, 2014 and 2013 was

7.75 percent

.

For the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below.

Sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions.

A one-half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $76.8 million and $89.6 million at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively, and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by $6.4 million, $6.9 million and $5.8 million for


,


and


, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $85.3 million and, $99.4 million at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively, and increased pension and other postretirement benefit cost by $6.5 million, $7.5 million and $6.2 million for

A one-half percent increase in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by $5.8 million, $5.2 million and $4.8 million for

,


and


, respectively.

Further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs (benefits) are found in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.



Income taxes

We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for this allowance, we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income, the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made.

Additionally, we file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The income tax returns for FMC entities taxable in the U.S. and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment. We assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We adjust these liabilities, if necessary, upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law.

See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional discussion surrounding income taxes.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our earnings, cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity, interest and currency exchange rates. To accomplish this, we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions.

The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. The range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen.

At

December 31, 2015

, our net financial instrument position was a net liability of

$13.4 million

compared to a net liability of

$92.5 million

at

December 31, 2014

. The change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to lower unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios.

Since our risk management programs are generally highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure.

Commodity Price Risk

Energy costs are diversified among coal, electricity and natural gas. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixed-price contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil. To analyze the effect of changing energy prices, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at

December 31, 2015

and


, with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant.

Our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment enters into contracts with certain customers in Brazil to exchange our products for future physical delivery of soybeans. To mitigate the price risk associated with these barter contracts, we enter into offsetting derivatives to hedge our exposure. As of

December 31, 2015

and


our net financial instrument position was immaterial.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the euro, the Chinese yuan, the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. Foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows.

To analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at

December 31, 2015

and


, with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant.

______________

(1)

Includes the unrealized loss on hedging the purchase price of Cheminova as of

December 31, 2014

. See "Cheminova Acquisition

Hedge Costs" in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.



Interest Rate Risk

One of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements. In these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of

December 31, 2015

and


, we had no interest rate swap agreements.

Our debt portfolio at

December 31, 2015

is composed of 56 percent fixed-rate debt and 44 percent variable-rate debt. The variable-rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our Term Loan Facility, commercial paper program, Credit Facility, variable-rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds, and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines. Changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable-rate debt portfolio in different ways.

Based on the variable-rate debt in our debt portfolio at

December 31, 2015

, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by $9.6 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by $3.3  million for the year ended

December 31, 2015

.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1: Principal Accounting Policies and Related Financial Information

Nature of operations

. We are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural, consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions, applications and market-leading products. We operate in

three

distinct business segments: FMC Agricultural Solutions, FMC Health and Nutrition and FMC Lithium. Our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment develops, markets and sells all

three

major classes of crop protection chemicals – insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. These products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects, weeds and disease, as well as pest control in non-agricultural markets. The FMC Health and Nutrition segment focuses on nutritional ingredients, health excipients, and functional health ingredients.  Nutritional ingredients are used to enhance texture, color, structure and physical stability. Health excipients are used for binding, encapsulation and disintegrant applications. Functional health ingredients are  used as active ingredients in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical markets. Our FMC Lithium segment manufactures lithium for use in a wide range of lithium products, which are used primarily in energy storage, specialty polymer and chemical synthesis application.

Basis of consolidation and basis of presentation

. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of FMC Corporation and its subsidiaries were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FMC and all entities that we directly or indirectly control. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Discontinued operations and reclassifications.

In February 2015, our FMC Alkali Chemicals division ("ACD") was classified as a discontinued operation. For more information on discontinued operations see Note 9. As a result, our FMC Minerals segment, which previously included our FMC Alkali Chemicals and FMC Lithium divisions, was renamed FMC Lithium. We have recast all the data within this filing to reflect the changes in our reportable segments to conform to the current year presentation and to present ACD as a discontinued operation retrospectively for all periods presented. In addition, certain other prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation.

Estimates and assumptions

. In preparing the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, but we do not believe such differences will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Cash equivalents

. We consider investments in all liquid debt instruments with original maturities of

3 months

or less to be cash equivalents.

Trade receivables, net of allowance

. Trade receivables consist of amounts owed to us from customer sales and are recorded when revenue is recognized. The allowance for trade receivables represents our best estimate of the probable losses associated with potential customer defaults. In developing our allowance for trade receivables, we use a two stage process which includes calculating a general formula to develop an allowance to appropriately address the uncertainty surrounding collection risk of our entire portfolio and specific allowances for customers where the risk of collection has been reasonably identified either due to liquidity constraints or disputes over contractual terms and conditions.

Our method of calculating the general formula consists of estimating the recoverability of trade receivables based on historical experience, current collection trends, and external business factors such as economic factors, including regional bankruptcy rates, and political factors. Our analysis of trade receivable collection risk is performed quarterly, and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. The allowance for trade receivable is

$13.9 million

and

$37.2 million

as of

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively. The allowance for long-term financing receivables is

$29.2 million

at December 31, 2015. The provision to the allowance for receivables charged against operations was

$5.9 million

,

$8.7 million

and

$5.1 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


, respectively.

. Investments in companies in which our ownership interest is

50 percent

or less and in which we exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted by our share of undistributed earnings and losses of these investments. Majority owned investments in which our control is restricted are also accounted for using the equity method. All other investments are carried at their fair values or at cost, as appropriate. We are party to several joint venture investments throughout the world, which individually and in the aggregate are not significant to our financial results.

Inventories

. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Inventory costs include those costs directly attributable to products before sale, including all manufacturing overhead but excluding distribution costs. All domestic inventories, excluding materials and supplies, are determined on a last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) basis and our remaining inventories are recorded on a first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) basis. See Note 5.

Property, plant and equipment

. We record property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest, at cost. Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (land improvements—

20 years

, buildings—


to

40 years

, and machinery and equipment—

three

to

18 years

). Gains and losses are reflected in income upon sale or retirement of assets. Expenditures that extend the useful lives of property, plant and equipment or increase productivity are capitalized. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred through operating expense.

Capitalized interest

. We capitalized interest costs of

$7.8 million

in


,

$8.0 million

in


and

$4.6 million

in


. These costs were associated with the construction of certain long-lived assets and have been capitalized as part of the cost of those assets. We amortize capitalized interest over the assets’ estimated useful lives.

Impairments of long-lived assets

. We review the recovery of the net book value of long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the net book value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to an amount by which the net book value exceeds the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Asset retirement obligations

. We record asset retirement obligations at fair value at the time the liability is incurred if we can reasonably estimate the settlement date. The associated asset retirement obligations (“AROs”) are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of related long-lived assets. In future periods, the liability is accreted to its present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. We also adjust the liability for changes resulting from the passage of time and/or revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate. Upon retirement of the long-lived asset, we either settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or loss.

We have mining operations in our lithium business and we have legal reclamation obligations relate to these facilities upon closure of the mines. Also, we have obligations at the majority of our manufacturing facilities in the event of permanent plant shutdown. Certain of these obligations are recorded in our environmental reserves described in Note 10. For certain AROs not already accrued, we have calculated the fair value of these AROs and concluded that the present value of these obligations was immaterial at

December 31, 2015

and


. We have also determined that the liability for certain AROs cannot currently be calculated as the settlement dates are not reasonably estimable.  We will recognize the liability for these AROs, when sufficient information exists to estimate a range of potential settlement dates.

The carrying amounts for the AROs for the years ended

December 31, 2015

and


are

$1.7 million

and

$1.7 million

, respectively. These amounts are included in "Other long-term liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheet.

Restructuring and other charges

. We continually perform strategic reviews and assess the return on our businesses. This sometimes results in a plan to restructure the operations of a business. We record an accrual for severance and other exit costs under the provisions of the relevant accounting guidance.

Additionally, as part of these restructuring plans, write-downs of long-lived assets may occur. Two types of assets are impacted: assets to be disposed of by sale and assets to be abandoned. Assets to be disposed of by sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or estimated net proceeds from the sale. Assets to be abandoned with no remaining future service potential are written down to amounts expected to be recovered. The useful life of assets to be abandoned that have a remaining future service potential are adjusted and depreciation is recorded over the adjusted useful life.

Capitalized software.

We capitalize the costs of internal use software in accordance with accounting literature which generally requires the capitalization of certain costs incurred to develop or obtain internal use software. We assess the recoverability of capitalized software costs on an ongoing basis and record write-downs to fair value as necessary. We amortize capitalized software costs over expected useful lives ranging from

three

to

10 years

. See Note 20 for the net unamortized computer software balances.

Goodwill and intangible assets

. Goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets (“intangibles”) are not subject to amortization. Instead, they are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value-based test.



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

We test goodwill and indefinite life intangibles for impairment annually using the criteria prescribed by U.S. GAAP accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets. Based upon our annual impairment assessment, conducted in


, we did not record any goodwill impairments and we believe that the fair value of our reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeds their carrying value. In


, we recorded indefinite life intangible impairments of

$19.6 million

. These amounts were associated with our Seal Sands facility in Health and Nutrition as well as events within Agricultural Solutions related to Cheminova integration and restructuring activities. These items are discussed further in Note 7. We did not record  goodwill or indefinite life intangible impairments to continuing operations in


and


.

Finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of patents, access rights, customer relationships, brands, registration rights, industry licenses, developed formulations and other intangibles and are being amortized over periods of

five

to

25 years

. See Note 4 for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets and Note 7 for additional information on the indefinite life intangible impairments.

Revenue recognition

. We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, which is generally upon transfer of title. This transfer typically occurs either upon shipment to the customer or upon receipt by the customer. In all cases, we apply the following criteria in recognizing revenue: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Rebates due to customers are accrued as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded based on the contract terms.

We periodically enter into prepayment arrangements with customers, primarily in our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment, and receive advance payments for product to be delivered in future periods. These advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue and classified as “Advance payments from customers” on the consolidated balance sheet. Revenue associated with advance payments is recognized as shipments are made and title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer.

We record amounts billed for shipping and handling fees as revenue. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded as costs of sales and services. Amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements. We record a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority.

Research and Development.

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. In-process research and development acquired as part of asset acquisitions, which include license and development agreements, are expensed as incurred and included as a component of “Restructuring and other charges (income).”

Income and other taxes

. We provide current income taxes on income reported for financial statement purposes adjusted for transactions that do not enter into the computation of income taxes payable and recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We do not provide income taxes on the equity in undistributed earnings of consolidated foreign subsidiaries as it is our intention that such earnings will remain invested in those companies.

Foreign currency

. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. For foreign operations for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar we record translation gains and losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in equity. The foreign operations' income statements are translated at the monthly exchange rates for the period.

We record remeasurement gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivables and payables, which are not in the functional currency of the operation. These remeasurement gains and losses are recorded in the income statement as they occur. We generally enter into foreign currency contracts to mitigate the financial risk associated with these transactions.  See “Derivative financial instruments” below and Note 17.

Derivative financial instruments

. We mitigate certain financial exposures, including currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price exposures, through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We enter into foreign exchange contracts, including forward and purchased option contracts, to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

We recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. On the date the derivative instrument is entered into, we generally designate the derivative as either a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge) or a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge). We record in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

as, and meet all the required criteria for, a cash flow hedge. We then reclassify these amounts into earnings as the underlying hedged item affects earnings. We record immediately in earnings changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges.

We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes relating derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, both at the inception of the hedge and throughout its term, whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. If we determine that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.

Treasury stock

. We record shares of common stock repurchased at cost as treasury stock, resulting in a reduction of stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When the treasury shares are contributed under our employee benefit plans or issued for option exercises, we use a first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method for determining cost. The difference between the cost of the shares and the market price at the time of contribution to an employee benefit plan is added to or deducted from the related capital in excess of par value of common stock.

Segment information

. We determined our reportable segments based on our strategic business units, the commonalities among the products and services within each segment and the manner in which we review and evaluate operating performance.

We have identified FMC Agricultural Solutions, FMC Health and Nutrition and FMC Lithium as our reportable segments. Segment disclosures are included in Note 19. Segment operating profit is defined as segment revenue less segment operating expenses (segment operating expenses consist of costs of sales and services, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses). We have excluded the following items from segment operating profit: corporate staff expense, interest income and expense associated with corporate debt facilities and investments, income taxes, gains (or losses) on divestitures of businesses, restructuring and other charges (income), investment gains and losses, loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairments, LIFO inventory adjustments, acquisition related costs, non-operating pension and postretirement charges, and other income and expense items. Information about how restructuring and other charges (income) relate to our businesses at the segment level is discussed in Note 7.

Segment assets and liabilities are those assets and liabilities that are recorded and reported by segment operations. Segment operating capital employed represents segment assets less segment liabilities. Segment assets exclude corporate and other assets, which are principally cash equivalents, the LIFO reserve on inventory, deferred income taxes, eliminations of intercompany receivables and property and equipment not attributable to a specific segment, such as capitalized interest. Segment liabilities exclude substantially all debt, income taxes, pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities, environmental reserves and related recoveries, restructuring reserves, fair value of currency contracts, intercompany eliminations, and reserves for discontinued operations.

Geographic segment revenue is based on the location of our customers. Geographic segment long-lived assets include investments, net property, plant and equipment, and other non-current assets. Geographic segment data is included in Note 19.

Stock compensation plans

. We recognize compensation expense in the financial statements for all share options and other equity-based arrangements. Share-based compensation cost is measured at the date of grant, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized over the employee’s requisite service period. See Note 14 for further discussion on our share-based compensation.

Environmental obligations

. We provide for environmental-related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used.

Estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a Record of Decision (“ROD”), or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (“RI/FS”), or equivalent, that is submitted by us and the appropriate government agency or agencies. Estimates are reviewed quarterly and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. The estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and/or study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment. Such costs principally include, among other items, RI/FS, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, management costs, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. Estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites.

Included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation, maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans ("OM&M"). Such reserves are based on our best estimates for these OM&M plans. Over time we may incur OM&M costs in excess of these reserves. However, we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably estimate the period for which such OM&M plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation, as conditions at these environmental sites change over time. Such additional OM&M costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years.

Included in the environmental reserve balance, other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies which we believe are probable of recovery.

Provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named Potentially Responsible Parties (“PRPs”) or other third parties. Such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values.

In calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves, we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by Comprehensive Environmental Remediation, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and the analogous state laws on all PRPs and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other PRPs at each site to the extent possible. We have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. Although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of PRPs and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve on a site-by-site basis. Our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. We believe that any recorded recoveries related to PRPs are realizable in all material respects. Recoveries are recorded as either an offset in “Environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued” or as “Other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with U.S. accounting literature.

Pension and other postretirement benefits.

We provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees. The costs (or benefits) and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including interest (discount) rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees. The costs (or benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, such as average retirement age, mortality, employee turnover, and plan participation. To the extent our plans’ actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans’ funding requirements, could increase or decrease. When actual results differ from our assumptions, the difference is typically recognized over future periods. In addition, the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs (or benefits) in future periods. See Note 13 for additional information relating to pension and other postretirement benefits.

Note 2: Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Regulatory Items

New Accounting guidance and regulatory items

On February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued its new lease accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).  Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) a lease liability, which is a lessee‘s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.  The new standard is effective for fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e. a January 1, 2019 effective date).  We are evaluating the effect the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, "Financial Instruments--Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income.  We are evaluating the effect the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This new standard changes the criteria by which to measure inventory. Prior to the issuance of this new standard, inventory was measured at the lower of cost or market value. This required three separate data points in order to measure inventory. The three data points were cost, market with a ceiling of net realizable value and market with a floor of net realizable value less a normal profit margin. This amendment eliminates the two data points defining "market" and replaces them with one, net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  This amendment does not impact inventory measured using last-in, first-out. We are required to adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2017 and early adoption is permitted. We believe the adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. This guidance will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. We intend to adopt this standard for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.

Recently adopted accounting guidance

In November 2015 the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,

Income Taxes (Topic 740) Related to the Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

which will require entities to present deferred tax assets (DTAs) and deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.  The ASU simplifies the current guidance, which requires entities to separately present DTAs and DTLs as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.  We have adopted this ASU as of December 31, 2015 and prior periods have not been adjusted to reflect this adoption.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,

Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments

. This new standard eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments associated with business combinations. This new guidance does not change what constitutes a measurement period adjustment.  We have adopted this guidance prospectively beginning in the third quarter of 2015. For more information on the measurement period adjustments recorded during 2015, see Note 3.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,

Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs

. The amendments in this new standard require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this standard. As permitted under the guidance, we have adopted this Standard at December 31, 2015 and have reclassified all prior periods to be consistent with the requirements as outlined in the ASU. The impact of the prior period reclassification was a

$14.5 million

reduction of Other assets on our consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding reduction in long-term debt as of December 31, 2014.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,

Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis

.  This new standard changes the consolidation evaluation for entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. We are required to adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2016 but under the rules have elected to adopt as part of year end 2015.  We have evaluated the effect that ASU 2015-02 had on our consolidated financial statements and have determined that there was no impact upon adoption.

In April 2014, the FASB issued its updated guidance on the financial reporting of discontinued operations. This new standard changed the criteria for reporting discontinued operations while enhancing disclosures in this area. Under the this guidance, only



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations. Additionally, expanded disclosures about discontinued operations would be required to provide financial statement users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of discontinued operations. This guidance impacts disclosures within an entity's financial statements and notes to the financial statements. We have adopted this guidance prospectively beginning in 2015.

Note 3: Acquisitions

2015 Acquisitions:

Cheminova A/S

On April 21, 2015, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, we completed the acquisition of

100%

of the outstanding equity of Cheminova A/S, a Denmark

Aktieselskab

("Cheminova") from Auriga Industries A/S, a Denmark

Aktieselskab

for an aggregate purchase price of

$1.2 billion

, excluding assumed net debt and hedged-related costs totaling

$0.6 billion

(the “Acquisition”). The Acquisition was funded with the October 10, 2014 term loan which was secured for the purposes of the Acquisition. See Note 11 for more information.

Cheminova is being integrated into our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment and has been included within our results of operations since the date of acquisition. The acquisition of Cheminova broadens our supply capabilities and strengthen our geographic footprint, particularly in Europe.

Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation

The acquisition of Cheminova has been accounted for under the U.S. GAAP business combinations accounting guidance, and as such we have applied acquisition accounting. Acquisition accounting requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The aggregate purchase price noted above was allocated to the major categories of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the Acquisition date using primarily Level 2 and Level 3 inputs (see Note 17 for an explanation of Level 2 and 3 inputs). These Level 2 and Level 3 valuation inputs include an estimate of future cash flows and discount rates. Additionally, estimated fair values are based, in part, upon outside preliminary appraisals for certain assets, including specifically-identified intangible assets.

The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the residual amount allocated to goodwill, is based upon preliminary information. The allocation is subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) as additional information concerning final asset and liability valuations is obtained. Any changes to the initial allocation are referred to as measurement-period adjustments. Measurement-period adjustment since our initial preliminary estimates reported in our second quarter 2015 Form 10-Q were primarily related to decreases in the estimated fair values of certain current assets, property, plant and equipment and income taxes payable. These decreases were offset by increases in current and long-term asset and liabilities, intangible assets and deferred income taxes. The cumulative effect of all measurement-period adjustments resulted in an increase to recognized goodwill of approximately

$55 million

.

The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of trade receivables, inventories, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, legal reserves, contingent liabilities, including uncertain tax positions, deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as other assets and liabilities. During the measurement period, if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in revised estimated values of those assets or liabilities as of that date we will revise the preliminary purchase price allocation. The effect of measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date. The impact of all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments will be included in current period earnings.

The following table summarizes the consideration paid for Cheminova and the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, which have been allocated on a preliminary basis.



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

____________________

The Fair value of finished goods inventory acquired included a step-up in the value of approximately

$57.8 million

, of which all was expensed in 2015 and included in "Cost of sales and services" on the consolidated income statement.

(2)

The weighted average useful life of the acquired finite-lived intangibles, which primarily represents customer relationships, is approximately

20 years

.

(3)

Goodwill largely consists of expected cost synergies and economies of scale resulting from the business combination. None of the acquired goodwill will be deductible for income tax purposes.

(4)

Long-term debt assumed primarily consisted of mortgage debt and borrowings under existing Cheminova credit facilities. As of

December 31, 2015

the principal borrowings under this assumed debt has been settled using the borrowing under the October 10, 2014 term loan.

Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information

The following unaudited pro forma results of operations assume that the Acquisition occurred at the beginning of the periods presented. The pro forma amounts include certain adjustments, including interest expense on the borrowings used to complete the acquisition, depreciation and amortization expense and income taxes. The pro forma amounts for the twelve month period below exclude acquisition-related charges. The pro forma results do not include adjustments related to cost savings or other synergies that are anticipated as a result of the Acquisition. Accordingly, these unaudited pro forma results are presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations would have been if the acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2014, nor are they indicative of future results of operations.



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Acquisition-related charges

Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, costs incurred to complete the Acquisition as well as costs incurred to integrate Cheminova into our operations are expensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the costs incurred associated with these combined activities.

On the consolidated statements of income (loss), these charges are included in “Costs of sales and services.”

See "Cheminova Acquisition Hedge Costs" below for more information on these charges. On the consolidated statements of income (loss), these charges are included in “Selling, general and administrative expense.”

(4)

See Note 7 for more information. These charges are recorded as a component of “Restructuring and other charges (income)” on the  consolidated statements of income (loss).

Cheminova Acquisition Hedge Costs

Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding equity of Cheminova from Auriga for an aggregate purchase price of

$8.5 billion

Danish krone ("DKK"). At the time we entered into the Purchase Agreement, the U.S. dollar ("USD" or “$”) to DKK exchange rate was USD

$1.00

to DKK

$5.77

, resulting in a USD purchase price of

$1.47 billion

, excluding assumed debt of approximately

$0.3 billion

. In order to minimize our exposure to adverse changes in the USD to DKK exchange rate from September 8, 2014 to April 21, 2015 (the acquisition close date), we entered into a series of foreign currency forward contracts ("FX forward contracts"). The FX forward contracts provided us the ability to fix the USD to DKK exchange rate for most of the DKK

$8.5 billion

purchase price, thereby limiting our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations. Over the period from September 2014 to April 21, 2015 the USD strengthened against the DKK by approximately

21 percent

to an exchange rate of USD

$1.00

to DKK

$6.96

. The strengthening of the USD against the DKK results in a lower USD purchase price for Cheminova. Partially offsetting this was a mark-to-market net loss settlement on the FX forward contracts of

$172.1 million

in 2015 and

$99.6 million

in 2014.

2014 Acquisitions:

Noncontrolling interest purchase:

In October 2014 we purchased the remaining

6.25%

ownership interest from the last remaining non-controlling interest holder in a legal entity within our discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals division. See Note 15 for more information.

2013 Acquisitions

Epax:

In July 2013, we acquired

100 percent

of the stock of Epax Nutra Holding III AS and Epax UK Holding III AS (together, “Epax”) for

$339.6 million

. Epax is a global supplier of fish-based omega-3 EPA/DHA fatty acid concentrates. Epax was integrated into our FMC Health and Nutrition segment from the acquisition date.

The results of operations related to Epax have been included in our results since the acquisition date. This acquisition was considered a business under the U.S. GAAP business combinations accounting guidance, and therefore we applied acquisition accounting. Acquisition accounting requires, among other things, that assets and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

values as of the acquisition date. The net assets of the Epax acquisition were recorded at the estimated fair values using primarily Level 2 and Level 3 inputs (see Note 17 for an explanation of Level 2 and 3 inputs). In valuing acquired assets and liabilities, valuation inputs include an estimate of future cash flows and discount rates based on the internal rate of return and the weighted average rate of return.

Restructuring Activities

Cheminova Restructuring

On April 21, 2015 we completed the acquisition of Cheminova. See Note 3 for more details. As part of the integration of Cheminova into our existing FMC Agricultural Solutions segment we implemented a restructuring plan. The restructuring plan includes workforce reductions, relocation of current operating locations, lease termination fees and fixed asset accelerated depreciation as well as fixed asset disposal charges at several of our FMC Agricultural Solutions' facilities. Included within these actions was the decision to exit our generic crop protection business in Brazil, Consagro Agroquimica Ltda. (Consagro).

Consagro Crop Protection Business

On September 10, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our generic crop protection business in Brazil, Consagro, to Atanor do Brazil Ltda., the Brazilian subsidiary of Albaugh, LLC. The sale of Consagro is part of our broad strategy to focus our portfolio of valued-added products, especially with the addition of the Cheminova product line in Brazil.  This sale was completed in the fourth quarter of  2015 and resulted in

$31.9 million

of cash proceeds. The proceeds from the sale are included within "Proceeds from sale of investments" on the consolidated statement of cash flows. As a result of the sale, we recorded a loss of

$64.5 million

representing the carrying value of the assets less the net proceeds and the costs of selling the business.

Health and Nutrition Restructuring

In 2014 our FMC Health and Nutrition segment implemented a plan to restructure a portion of its operations. The objective of the restructuring was to better align our business and costs to macroeconomic and market realities. The restructuring decision resulted in workforce reductions at several of our FMC Health and Nutrition facilities. In 2015, these restructuring activities continued with the mothballing of our Seal Sands UK facility as well as the sale of our pectin manufacturing business.

Seal Sands

Our Seal Sands facility was acquired as part of the EPAX acquisition for the manufacture of specific pharmaceutical  Omega-3-Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API's) which would compete as a generic alternative to the prescription Lovaza drug.  This facility started operations in 2014, and during both 2014 and 2015 was used for productions of these generic Lovaza alternatives.  However, since the start of the operations, the dynamics of the Lovaza market have changed dramatically as several generic players have penetrated the market sooner  than originally expected, and growth overall has slowed as the category has become mature.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, given the lack of demand for these Omega-3 products, we took action and mothballed the site.

As a result of this decision, we accelerated the depreciation of the remaining carrying value of the site to its salvage value over its remaining expected use period.  Since we believe the expected use period is limited, these accelerated depreciation charges were all incurred in the fourth quarter of 2015 and no further accelerated depreciation charges are expected in 2016.  These accelerated depreciation charges totaled approximately

$45.8 million

. Additionally, we wrote off stranded inventory at the site which totaled approximately

$14.4 million

.  As a result of the mothballing decision, this inventory had no other outlets and cannot be able to be reworked elsewhere and therefore became impaired as a result of these events.

Finally, the decisions noted above resulted in the need for us to re-test for impairment the EPAX indefinite-lived intangible asset.  As a result of that test, an impairment charge of

$10.3 million

was recognized associated with this indefinite lived asset.

Pectin

As part of our Health and Nutrition Restructuring we changed our strategy for pectin shifting our focus from the manufacture of standard grade pectin to concentrate on higher-value, more specialized solutions for our customers. To accomplish our goals under this new strategy on September 11, 2015, we completed the sale of our pectin manufacturing business, located in Milazzo, Italy, to Cargill, Inc (Cargill). The sale resulted in approximately

$7.0 million

in proceeds and a loss on sale of

$11.9 million

in

December 31, 2015

. The proceeds from the sale are included within "Proceeds from sale of investment/business" on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The loss of

$11.9 million

was comprised of net assets sold of

$18.9 million

which primarily included property, plant and equipment and trade working capital (i.e., trade receivables and payables as well as inventory). In connection with the sale we entered into a customary transitional services agreement with Cargill to provide for the orderly separation of the business. We provided these services to Cargill for three months after closing. We also entered into an arm's-length supply agreement with Cargill, which provides us with more efficient and flexible sourcing on a broad range of both standard and specialty pectin grades.

Environmental charges represent the net charges associated with environmental remediation at continuing operating sites, see Note 10 for additional details. Environmental obligations for continuing operations primarily represent obligations at shut down or abandoned facilities within businesses that do not meet the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations.

Argentina Devaluation

On December 17, 2015 the Argentina government initiated actions to significantly devalue its currency.  These actions created an immediate loss associated with the impacts of the remeasurement of our local balance sheet at the date of the devaluation. The loss was attributable to Lithium and Agricultural Solutions operations. Because of the severity of the event and its immediate impact to our operations in the country, the charge associated with the remeasurement was included within restructuring and other charges in our consolidated income statement.

Belchim Crop Protection Sale

During 2015 we sold our remaining ownership interest in a Belgian-based pesticide distribution company, Belchim Crop Protection N.V. ("Belchim"). Prior to and subsequent to the sale, Belchim was accounted for as a cost method investment. The gain on the sale was

$26.6 million

.

In 2014 we sold the first portion of our ownership interest in Belchim. Belchim was previously accounted for as a cost method investment. The gain on the sale from the first portion was also

$26.6 million

Note 8: Receivables

The following table displays a roll forward of the allowance for doubtful trade receivables for fiscal years 2014 and 2015.

The company has financing receivables that represent long-term customer receivable balances related to past due accounts which are not expected to be collected within the current year. The net long-term customer receivables were

$90.6 million

as of December  31, 2015. These long-term customer receivable balances and the corresponding allowance are included in Other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. For these long-term customer receivables, interest is no longer accrued when the receivable is determined to be delinquent and classified as long-term based on the estimated timing of collection.

A portion of these long-term receivables have payment contracts. We have no reason to believe payments will not be made based upon the credit quality of these customers.  Additionally, we also hold significant collateral against these customers including rights to property or other assets as a form of credit guarantee. If the customer does not pay or gives indication that they will not pay, these guarantees allow us to start legal action to block the sale of the customer’s harvest. On an ongoing basis, we continue to evaluate the credit quality of our financing receivables using aging of receivables, collection experience and write-offs, as well as evaluating existing economic conditions, to determine if an additional allowance is necessary.

The following table displays a roll forward of the allowance for credit losses related to long-term customer receivables for fiscal years 2015.

Note 10: Environmental Obligations

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants, discharges of water pollutants, and the manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes and other toxic materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We are also subject to liabilities arising under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar state laws that impose responsibility on persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances, and on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the clean-up of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment. We are also subject to liabilities under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and analogous state laws that require owners and operators of facilities that have treated, stored or disposed of hazardous waste pursuant to a RCRA permit to follow certain waste management practices and to clean up releases of hazardous substances into the environment associated with past or present practices. In addition, when deemed appropriate, we enter certain sites with potential liability into voluntary remediation compliance programs, which are also subject to guidelines that require owners and operators, current and previous, to clean up releases of hazardous substances into the environment associated with past or present practices.

Environmental liabilities consist of obligations relating to waste handling and the remediation and/or study of sites at which we are alleged to have released or disposed of hazardous substances. These sites include current operations, previously operated sites, and sites associated with discontinued operations. We have provided reserves for potential environmental obligations that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the obligation can be made. Accordingly, total reserves of

$348.2 million

and

$296.2 million

, respectively, before recoveries, existed at

December 31, 2015

and


.

The estimated reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies, net of expected recoveries, exceed amounts accrued by approximately

$230 million

at

December 31, 2015

. This reasonably possible estimate is based upon information available as of the date of the filing and the actual future losses may be higher given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites.

Additionally, although potential environmental remediation expenditures in excess of the reserves and estimated loss contingencies could be significant, the impact on our future consolidated financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation due to numerous uncertainties concerning the nature and scope of possible contamination at many sites, identification of remediation alternatives under constantly changing requirements, selection of new and diverse clean-up technologies to meet compliance standards, the timing of potential expenditures and the allocation of costs among Potentially Responsible Parties ("PRPs") as well as other third parties.  The liabilities arising from potential environmental obligations that have not been reserved for at this time may be material to any one quarter's or year's results of operations in the future. However, we believe any liability arising from such potential



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

environmental obligations is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or financial condition as it may be satisfied over many years.

The table below is a roll forward of our total environmental reserves, continuing and discontinued, from December 31,


to

Significant Environmental Sites

Pocatello

From 1949 until 2001, we operated the world's largest elemental phosphorus plant in Power County, Idaho, just outside the city of Pocatello. Since the plant's closure, FMC has worked with the EPA, the State of Idaho, and the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes to develop a proposed cleanup plan for the property. In September of 2012, the EPA issued an Interim Record of Decision ("IROD") that is environmentally protective and that ensures the health and safety of both workers and the general public.  Since the plant's closure,

we have successfully decommissioned our Pocatello plant, completed closure of the RCRA ponds and formally requested that the EPA acknowledge completion of work under a June 1999 RCRA Consent Decree. Future remediation costs include completion of the IROD that addresses groundwater contamination and existing waste disposal areas on the Pocatello plant portion of the Eastern Michaud Flats Superfund Site. In June 2013 EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order to us under which we will implement the IROD remedy. Our current reserves factor in the estimated costs associated with implementing the IROD. In addition to implementing the IROD, we continue to conduct work pursuant to CERCLA unilateral administrative orders to address air emissions from beneath the cap of several of the closed RCRA ponds.

The amount of the reserve for this site was

$44.9 million

and

$68.6 million

at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively.

Pocatello Tribal Litigation

For a number of years, we engaged in disputes with the Tribes concerning their attempts to regulate our activities on the reservation. On March 6, 2006, a U.S. District Court Judge found that the Tribes were a third-party beneficiary of a 1998 RCRA Consent Decree and ordered us to apply for any applicable Tribal permits relating to the nearly-complete RCRA Consent Decree work. The third-party beneficiary ruling was later reversed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but the permitting process continued in the tribal legal system. We applied for the tribal permits, but preserved objections to the Tribes' jurisdiction.

In addition, in 1998, the Tribes and we entered into an agreement (“1998 Agreement”) that required us to pay the Tribes

$1.5 million

per year for waste generated from operating our Pocatello plant and stored on site. We paid

$1.5 million

per year until December 2001 when the plant closed. In our view the agreement was terminated, as the plant was no longer generating waste. The Tribes claim that the 1998 Agreement has no end date.

On April 25, 2006, the Tribes' Land Use Policy Commission issued us a Special Use Permit for the “disposal and storage of waste” at the Pocatello plant and imposed a

$1.5 million

per annum permit fee. The permit and fee were affirmed by the Tribal Business Council on July 21, 2006. We sought review of the permit and fee in Tribal Court, in which the Tribes also brought a claim for breach of the 1998 Agreement. On May 21, 2008, the Tribal Court reversed the permit and fee, finding that they were not authorized under tribal law, and dismissed the Tribes' breach of contract claim. The Tribes appealed to the Tribal Court of Appeals.

On May 8, 2012, the Tribal Court of Appeals reversed the May 21, 2008 Tribal Court decision and issued a decision finding the permit and fee validly authorized and ordering us to pay waste permit fees in the amount of

$1.5 million

per annum for the years 2002-2007 (

$9.0 million

in total), the Tribes' demand as set forth in the lawsuit. It also reinstated the breach of contract claim. The Tribes have filed additional litigation to recover the permit fees for the years since 2007, but that litigation has been stayed pending the outcome of the appeal in the Tribal Court of Appeals.

Following a trial on certain jurisdictional issues which occurred during April 2014, the Shoshone-Bannock Tribal Appellate Court issued a Statement of Decision finding in favor of the Tribes’ jurisdiction over FMC and awarding costs on appeal to the Tribes. The Tribal Appellate Court conducted further post-trial proceedings and on May 6, 2014 issued Finding and Conclusions and a Final Judgment consistent with its earlier Statement of Decision.

The finding by the Shoshone-Bannock Tribal Appellate Court in May 2014 does not impact our reserves for the period ended December 31, 2015. Having now exhausted the Tribal administrative and judicial process, in November 2014 we filed an action in the United States District Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that the Tribes lacked jurisdiction.

We have estimated a reasonably possible loss for this matter and it has been reflected in our total reasonably possible loss estimate previously discussed within this note.

Middleport

Our Middleport, NY facility is currently an Agricultural Solutions formulation and packaging plant that formerly manufactured arsenic-based and other products. As a result of past manufacturing operations and waste disposal practices at this facility, releases of hazardous substances have occurred at the the site that have affected soil, sediment, surface water and groundwater at the facility's property and also in adjacent off-site areas. The impact of our discontinued operations was the subject of an Administrative Order on Consent (“AOC”) entered into with the EPA and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (the



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

“Agencies”) in 1991. The AOC requires us to (1) define the nature and extent of contamination caused by our historical plant operations, (2) take interim corrective measures and (3) evaluate Corrective Action Management Alternatives (“CMA”) for discrete contaminated areas.

We have defined the nature and extent of the contamination and have constructed an engineered cover, closed the RCRA regulated surface water impoundments and are collecting and treating both surface water runoff and ground water, which has satisfied the first two requirements of the AOC.

In 2013 we received from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ("NYSDEC"), the Final Statement of Basis ("FSOB"). The FSOB includes the same CMA as the Preliminary Statement of Basis, which we continue to believe is overly conservative and is not consistent with the 1991 AOC, which governs the remedy selection.

In order to negotiate with the NYSDEC with respect to the FSOB, we entered into a tolling agreement with the NYSDEC. The tolling agreement serves as a “standstill” agreement to the FSOB so that time spent negotiating with the NYSDEC does not go against the statute of limitations under the FSOB. The tolling agreement expired on April 30, 2014. We were not able to reach an agreement with the NYSDEC; thus, on May 1, 2014, we submitted a Notice of Dispute to the EPA seeking review of the remedy chosen by the NYSDEC. On May 30, 2014, 30 days after the tolling period expired, we filed an action in the Supreme Court of New York formally challenging the NYSDEC's FSOB. In that lawsuit, we are contending that NYSDEC breached the 1991 AOC by not following the procedures set forth in the AOC for remedy selection.  On June 3, 2014, we received a letter from EPA (dated May 22, 2014) declining to review the Notice of Dispute.  On June 20, 2014, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York seeking a declaratory judgment that the EPA is obligated under the 1991 AOC to hear the dispute. On August 20, 2015, the Supreme Court of New York dismissed our state action on procedural grounds. We have appealed that dismissal to the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division, Third Department. Our existing federal action before the United States District Court for the Western District of New York is still pending.

The amount of the reserve for this site is

$40.1 million

and

$44.9 million

at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively. Our reserve continues to include the estimated liability for clean-up to reflect the costs associated with our recommended CMA. Our estimated reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies exposure reflects the additional cost of the CMA proposed in the FSOB.

Other Potentially Responsible Party (“PRP”) Sites

We have been named a PRP at


sites on the federal government’s National Priorities List (“NPL”), at which our potential liability has not yet been settled. In addition, we received notice from the EPA or other regulatory agencies that we may be a PRP, or PRP equivalent, at other sites, including


sites at which we have determined that it is reasonably possible that we have an environmental liability. In cooperation with appropriate government agencies, we are currently participating in, or have participated in, a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (“RI/FS”), or equivalent, at most of the identified sites, with the status of each investigation varying from site to site. At certain sites, a RI/FS has only recently begun, providing limited information, if any, relating to cost estimates, timing, or the involvement of other PRPs; whereas, at other sites, the studies are complete, remedial action plans have been chosen, or a ROD has been issued.

One site where FMC is listed as a PRP is the Portland Harbor Superfund Site (“Portland Harbor”), that includes the river and sediments of a 12 mile section of the lower reach of the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon that runs through an industrialized area. Portland Harbor is listed on the NPL. FMC formerly owned and operated a manufacturing site adjacent to this section of the river and has since sold its interest in this business. When the EPA determines the cleanup remedy from the RI/FS conducted during the last decade at the site, it will issue a ROD. Currently, FMC and


other parties including the current owner of the former FMC site are involved in a non-judicial allocation process to determine each party’s respective share of the cleanup costs. The EPA is expected to develop a  ROD by 2017. It is anticipated that the cleanup activities will begin within one year of the issuance of the ROD.

Any potential liability to FMC will represent a portion of the costs of the remedy the EPA is expected to select for Portland Harbor. The cost of that remedy is expected to be allocated among more than


potentially responsible parties.  Because of the large number of responsible parties and the variability in range of remediation alternatives, we are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of our potential exposure for Portland Harbor at this time. Based on information currently available, we have no reason to believe that the ultimate resolution of our potential obligations at Portland Harbor will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that the outcome will be favorable. Adverse results in the outcome of the EPA decision could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations in any one reporting period, or liquidity.

deferred tax assets based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a “more likely than not” standard. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and tax planning alternatives. We operate and derive income from multiple lines of business across multiple jurisdictions. As each of the respective lines of business experiences changes in operating results across their geographic footprint, we may encounter losses in jurisdictions that have been historically profitable, and as a result might require additional valuation allowances to be recorded. We are committed to implementing tax planning actions, when deemed appropriate, in jurisdictions that experience losses in order to realize deferred tax assets prior to their expiration.

During 2015, our Agricultural Solutions business in Brazil experienced significant current and cumulative losses driven by unfavorable market conditions and currency impacts. Considering the current year losses, available tax planning strategies, and  unfavorable projections of operating performance expected for 2016, the Company concluded that sufficient positive evidence to realize its net deferred tax assets in Brazil was not available as of December 31, 2015 and therefore established valuation allowances in the amount of

$106.5 million

.

At

December 31, 2015

, we had net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards as follows: U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of

$24.5 million

(tax-effected) expiring in future years through 2035, foreign net operating loss carryforwards of

$136.6 million

(tax-effected) expiring in various future years, and other tax credit carryforwards of

$6.2 million

expiring in various future years.

The effective income tax rate applicable to income from continuing operations before income taxes was different from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate due to the factors listed in the following table:

(1)      Includes adjustments for transaction gains or losses on net monetary assets for which no corresponding tax expense or benefit is

realized and the tax provision for statutory taxable losses in foreign jurisdictions for which there is no corresponding amount in

income before income taxes.

The material factors contributing to the reduction in income from continuing operations experienced in 2015 were Cheminova acquisition related charges incurred by our domestic operations, reduced results in our Agricultural Solutions business, primarily in Brazil, as well as significant restructuring charges.  The statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions where these charges were incurred are similar to the U.S. Federal statutory rate; therefore, the reduction in income from continuing operations did not significantly impact the tax benefit disclosed above for foreign earnings subject to different tax rates.  Earnings from operations located in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the U.S. Federal statutory rate, such as Ireland and Hong Kong, were generally consistent in 2015 compared to 2014.  From 2013 to 2014, earnings from operations in Hong Kong increased, driving the increase in favorable foreign rate differential between those years. The tax rate for 2015 as compared to prior years was unfavorably impacted by a material increase in valuation allowances in our Agricultural Solutions business, primarily in Brazil.

Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which we have not provided taxes approximate

$1,787.4 million

. We have not provided taxes for these earnings given that our intention, as of

December 31, 2015

, is to indefinitely reinvest such earnings in



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

the respective existing foreign operations. We have not provided deferred tax liabilities for basis differences in investments in subsidiaries because the investments are essentially permanent in duration or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise upon disposal. A liability may arise in the future if our intention to indefinitely reinvest such earnings were to change, however it is not practical to estimate the income tax liability that may be incurred.

Uncertain Income Tax Positions

U.S. GAAP accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a model for the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, disclosure and transition.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. The income tax returns for FMC entities taxable in the U.S. and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment.  As of

December 31, 2015

, the U. S. federal and state income tax returns are open for examination and adjustment for the years 2012-2015 and 2004-2015, respectively. Our significant foreign jurisdictions, which total


, are open for examination and adjustment during varying periods from 2005-2015.

As of December 31, 2015, we had total unrecognized tax benefits of

$97.1 million

, of which

$31.5 million

would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2014, we had total unrecognized tax benefits of

$45.9 million

, of which

$11.1 million

would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as a component of income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized interest and penalties of

$2.0 million

,

$1.0 million

, and

$2.1 million

, respectively, in the consolidated statements of income. As of

December 31, 2015

and 2014, we have accrued interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheets of

$5.2 million

and

$3.2 million

, respectively.

Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state, or foreign examinations, and the expiration of various jurisdictional statutes of limitation, it is reasonably possible that our liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months by a range of

$2.5 million

to

$3.7 million

.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

____________________

we recognized an offsetting non-current deferred tax asset of

$65.5 million

,

$34.8 million

, and

$28.7 million

respectively, relating to specific uncertain tax positions presented above.

Covenants

Among other restrictions, the Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility contains financial covenants applicable to FMC and its consolidated subsidiaries related to leverage (measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings) and interest coverage (measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to interest expense). Our actual leverage for the four consecutive quarters ended

December 31, 2015

was

3.8

which is below the maximum leverage of

4.5

. During 2016, the maximum leverage ratio will step down in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. Our actual interest coverage for the four consecutive quarters ended

December 31, 2015

was

7.6

which is above the minimum interest coverage of

3.5

. We were in compliance with all covenants at

December 31, 2015

.

Term Loan Facility

On April 21, 2015 we borrowed

$1.65 billion

under our previous announced senior unsecured Term Loan Facility. The proceeds of the borrowing were used to finance the acquisition of Cheminova and to pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and the Term Loan Facility.  At

December 31, 2015

,

$900 million

remained outstanding under the Term Loan facility, as a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of our FMC Alkali division (see Note 9) was used to pay down the initial borrowings.

The scheduled maturity of the Term Loan Facility is on April 21, 2020. The borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement will bear interest at a floating rate, which will be a base rate or a Eurocurrency rate equal to the London interbank offered rate for the relevant interest period, plus in each case an applicable margin, as determined in accordance with the provisions of the Term Loan Agreement. The base rate will be the highest of: the rate of interest announced publicly by Citibank, N.A. in New York, New York from time to time as its “base rate”; the federal funds effective rate plus

1/2

of

one percent

; and the Eurocurrency rate for a one-month period plus

one percent

.



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The Term Loan Agreement also contains a cross-default provision whereby a default under our other indebtedness in excess of

$50.0 million

, after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders, would be an event of default under the Term Loan Agreement and could result in a demand for payment of all amounts outstanding under this facility.

Fees incurred to secure the Term Loan Facility have been deferred and will be amortized over the term of the arrangement.

Compensating Balance Agreements

We maintain informal credit arrangements in many foreign countries. Foreign lines of credit, which include overdraft facilities, typically do not require the maintenance of compensating balances, as credit extension is not guaranteed but is subject to the availability of funds.

Note 13: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

The funded status of our U.S. qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, our United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, and Norway defined benefit pension plans, plus our U.S. other postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefit plans for continuing operations, together with the associated balances and net periodic benefit cost recognized in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, are shown in the tables below.

We are required to recognize in our consolidated balance sheets the overfunded and underfunded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans. The overfunded or underfunded status is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. We are also required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive income the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period.

The following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations at December 31 for the U.S. Plans:

The estimated net actuarial loss and prior service cost for our pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into our net annual benefit cost (income) during 2016 are

$41.2 million

and

$0.7 million

The Curtailment loss is associated with the disposal of our FMC Alkali Chemicals division and was recorded to discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of income (loss).

Our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (“U.S. Plan”) holds the majority of our pension plan assets. The expected long-term rate of return on these plan assets was

7.25 percent

for

December 31, 2015

and

7.75 percent

for  the years ended December 31,


and


. In developing the assumption for the long-term rate of return on assets for our U.S. Plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on the assumption for long-term real returns by asset class, inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately

8.7 percent

over the last 20 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) and other factors. Given an actively managed investment portfolio, the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio, assuming an estimated inflation rate of approximately

2.0 percent

, is between

8.6 percent

and

10.5 percent

for equities, and between

5.5 percent

and

8.3 percent

for fixed-income investments, which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our assumption for the rate of return on assets. The target asset allocation for


, by asset category, is

80 percent

to

90 percent

equity securities,

10 percent

to

20 percent

fixed income investments and

zero

to

five percent

cash and other short-term investments.

Our U.S. qualified pension plan’s investment strategy consists of a total return investment management approach using a portfolio mix of equities and fixed income investments to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for an appropriate level of risk. The goal of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by matching asset growth to the plan’s liabilities over the long run. Furthermore, equity investments are weighted towards value equities and diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks. Derivatives and hedging instruments may be used effectively to manage and balance risks associated with the plan’s investments. Investment performance and related risks are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset and liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.

As of

December 31, 2015

and


we have

$89.9 million

and

$88.6 million

, respectively, of investments in certain funds where the net asset value reported by the underlying funds approximates the fair value. These investments are redeemable with the fund at net asset value under the original terms of the partnership agreements and/or subscription agreements and operations of the underlying funds. However, it is possible that these redemption rights may be restricted or eliminated by the funds in the future in accordance with the underlying fund agreements. Due to the nature of the investments held by the funds, changes in market conditions and the economic environment may significantly impact the net asset value of the funds and, consequently, the fair value of the interests in the funds. Furthermore, changes to the liquidity provisions of the funds may significantly impact the fair value of the interest in the funds.

The change in the value of plan assets using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for all periods presented was not material.

FMC Corporation Savings and Investment Plan

. The FMC Corporation Savings and Investment Plan is a qualified salary-reduction plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code in which substantially all of our U.S. employees may participate by contributing a portion of their compensation. For eligible employees participating in the Plan, except for those employees covered by certain collective bargaining agreements, the Company makes matching contributions of

80 percent

of the portion of those contributions up to

five percent

of the employee’s compensation. Eligible employees participating in the Plan that do not participate in the U.S. qualified pension plan are entitled to receive an employer contribution of

Note 14: Share-based Compensation

Stock Compensation Plans

We have a share-based compensation plan, which has been approved by the stockholders, for certain employees, officers and directors. This plan is described below.

FMC Corporation Incentive Compensation and Stock Plan

The FMC Corporation Incentive Compensation and Stock Plan (the “Plan”) provides for the grant of a variety of cash and equity awards to officers, directors, employees and consultants, including stock options, restricted stock, performance units (including restricted stock units), stock appreciation rights, and multi-year management incentive awards payable partly in cash and partly in common stock. The Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”), subject to the provisions of the Plan, approves financial targets, award grants, and the times and conditions for payment of awards to employees. The total number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the Plan is

29.0 million

of which approximately

5.6 million

shares of common stock are available for future grants of share based awards under the Plan as of

December 31, 2015

. The FMC Corporation Non-Employee Directors’ Compensation Policy, administered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Committee of the Board of Directors, sets forth the compensation to be paid to the directors, including awards (currently restricted stock units only) to be made to directors under the Plan.

Stock options granted under the Plan may be incentive or nonqualified stock options. The exercise price for stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. Awards granted under the Plan vest or become exercisable or payable at the time designated by the Committee, which has generally been three years from the date of grant. Incentive and nonqualified options granted under the Plan expire not later than

10 years

from the grant date.

Under the Plan, awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units may be made to selected employees. The awards vest over periods designated by the Committee, which has generally been

3 years

, with vesting conditional upon continued employment. Compensation cost is recognized over the vesting periods based on the market value of the stock on the date of the award. Restricted stock units granted to directors under the Plan vest immediately if granted as part of, or in lieu of, the annual retainer (but are subject to forfeiture on a pro rata basis if the director does not serve the full year except under certain circumstances); other restricted stock units granted to directors vest at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in the calendar year following the May 1 annual grant date.

At

December 31, 2015

and


, there were restricted stock units representing an aggregate of

168,634

shares and

140,656

shares of common stock, respectively, credited to the directors’ accounts.

Stock Compensation

We recognized the following stock compensation expense:

____________________

(1)

We applied an estimated forfeiture rate of

four percent

per stock option grant in the calculation of the expense.

(2)

We applied an estimated forfeiture rate of

two percent

of outstanding grants in the calculation of the expense.

(3)

This expense is classified as selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income. Total stock compensation expense, net of tax, of

$0.6 million

,

$1.4 million

, and

$1.8 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


, respectively, is included in the Discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

We received

$5.9 million

,

$8.6 million

and

$10.7 million

in cash related to stock option exercises for the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


, respectively. The shares used for the exercise of stock options occurring during the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


came from treasury shares.

For tax purposes, share-based compensation expense is deductible in the year of exercise or vesting based on the intrinsic value of the award on the date of exercise or vesting. For financial reporting purposes, share-based compensation expense is based upon grant-date fair value and amortized over the vesting period. Excess tax benefits represent the difference between the share-based compensation expense for financial reporting purposes and the deduction taken for tax purposes. The excess tax benefits for the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


totaled

$1.4 million

,

$4.7 million

and

$7.1 million

, respectively.

Stock Options

The grant-date fair values of the stock options we granted in the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


were estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, the key assumptions for which are listed in the table below. The expected volatility assumption is based on the actual historical experience of our common stock. The expected life represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities with terms equal to the expected timing of stock option exercises as of the grant date. The dividend yield assumption reflects anticipated dividends on our common stock.

December 31, 2015

, we had total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options of

$8.0 million

which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of approximately

1.8 years

.

Restricted Equity Awards

The grant-date fair value of restricted stock awards and stock units under the Plan is based on the market price per share of our common stock on the date of grant, and the related compensation cost is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period during which the employees perform related services, which is typically

three years

except for those eligible for retirement prior to the stated vesting period.

The reclassification of historical cumulative translation adjustments was the result of the divestiture of our FMC Peroxygens business. The loss recognized from this reclassification is considered permanent for tax purposes and therefore no tax has been provided. See Note 9 for more information. In accordance with accounting guidance, this amount was previously factored into the lower of cost or fair value test associated with the 2013 Peroxygens' asset held for sale write-down charges.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

We did not repurchase any shares under the publicly announced repurchase program. At

December 31, 2015

,

$250.0 million

remained unused under our Board-authorized repurchase program. This repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time. Shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. We also reacquire shares from time to time from employees in connection with the vesting, exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans.

Note 16: Earnings Per Share

Earnings per common share ("EPS") is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period on a basic and diluted basis.

Our potentially dilutive securities include potential common shares related to our stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Diluted earnings per share (“Diluted EPS”) considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities except in periods in which there is a loss because the inclusion of the potential common shares would have an antidilutive effect. Diluted EPS excludes the impact of potential common shares related to our stock options in periods in which the option exercise price is greater than the average market price of our common stock for the period. For the year ended

December 31, 2015

, we had a net loss from continuing operations attributable to FMC stockholders. As such, all

1.7 million

shares were potential common shares were excluded from Diluted EPS. For the years ended December 31,


and 2013 there were

386 thousand

and

374 thousand

, respectively, of potential common shares excluded from Diluted EPS.

Our non-vested restricted stock awards contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends, and thus, are participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing EPS. The two-class method determines EPS by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. In calculating the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period.

Earnings applicable to common stock and common stock shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:

Note 17: Financial Instruments, Risk Management and Fair Value Measurements

Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, other current assets, certain receivables classified as other long-term assets, accounts payable, and amounts included in investments and accruals meeting the definition of financial instruments. The carrying value of these financial instruments approximates their fair value. Our other financial instruments include the following:

The estimated fair value of the financial instruments in the above table have been determined using standard pricing models which take into account the present value of expected future cash flows discounted to the balance sheet date. These standard pricing models utilize inputs derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data such as interest rate yield curves and currency and commodity spot and forward rates. In addition, we test a subset of our valuations against valuations received from the transaction's counterparty to validate the accuracy of our standard pricing models. Accordingly, the estimates presented may not be indicative of the amounts that we would realize in a market exchange at settlement date and do not represent potential gains or losses on these agreements. The estimated fair values of foreign exchange forward contracts and commodity forward and option contracts are included in the tables within this Note. The estimated fair value of debt is

$2,214.0 million

and

$1,773.2 million

and the carrying amount is

$2,148.9 million

and

$1,664.1 million

as of

December 31, 2015

and

December 31, 2014

, respectively.

We enter into various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk as part of the normal course of business. These off-balance sheet instruments include financial guarantees and contractual commitments to extend financial guarantees under letters of credit, and other assistance to customers (Note 18). Decisions to extend financial guarantees to customers, and the amount of collateral required under these guarantees is based on our evaluation of creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.

We mitigate certain financial exposures, including currency risk, commodity purchase exposures and interest rate risk through a program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We enter into foreign exchange contracts, including forward and purchased option contracts, to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes relating derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also assess both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. If we determine that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Management

We conduct business in many foreign countries, exposing earnings, cash flows, and our financial position to foreign currency risks. The majority of these risks arise as a result of foreign currency transactions. Our policy is to minimize exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates. This is accomplished through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of foreign currency debt and forward foreign exchange contracts. We also use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows, with an objective of balancing currency risk to provide adequate protection from significant fluctuations in the currency markets.

The primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the euro, the Chinese yuan, the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso.



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly natural gas. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas.

Our Agricultural Solutions segment enters into contracts with certain customers in Brazil whereby we exchange our products for physical delivery of soybeans from the customer. In order to mitigate the price risk associated with these barter contracts, we have entered into offsetting derivatives to hedge our exposure.

Interest Rate Risk

We use various strategies to manage our interest rate exposure, including entering into interest rate swap agreements to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable-rate debt. In the agreements we exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable-interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of

December 31, 2015

and

December 31, 2014

, we had

no

such swap agreements in place.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Our counterparties to derivative contracts are primarily major financial institutions. We limit the dollar amount of contracts entered into with any one financial institution and monitor counterparties’ credit ratings. We also enter into master netting agreements with each financial institution, where possible, which helps mitigate the credit risk associated with our financial instruments. While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of counterparties, we consider this risk remote.

Financial Guarantees and Letter-of-Credit Commitments

We enter into various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk as part of the normal course of business. These off-balance-sheet instruments include financial guarantees and contractual commitments to extend financial guarantees under letters of credit and other assistance to customers (Notes 1 and 19). Decisions to extend financial guarantees to customers, and the amount of collateral required under these guarantees, is based on our evaluation of creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Cash Flow Hedges

We recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. On the date we enter into the derivative instrument, we generally designate the derivative as a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge). We record in AOCI changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as and meet all the required criteria for, a cash flow hedge. We then reclassify these amounts into earnings as the underlying hedged item affects earnings. In contrast we immediately record in earnings changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges.

As of

December 31, 2015

, we had open foreign currency forward contracts in AOCI in a net after-tax loss position of

$6.1 million

designated as cash flow hedges of underlying forecasted sales and purchases. Current open contracts hedge forecasted transactions until December 31, 2016. At

December 31, 2015

, we had open forward contracts with various expiration dates to buy, sell or exchange foreign currencies with a U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately

$505.2 million

.

As of

December 31, 2015

, we had current open commodity contracts in AOCI in a net after-tax loss position of

$1.3 million

designated as cash flow hedges of underlying forecasted purchases, primarily related to natural gas. Current open commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions until December 31, 2017. At

December 31, 2015

, we had

2.2 million

mmBTUs (millions of British Thermal Units) in aggregate notional volume of outstanding natural gas commodity forward contracts to hedge forecasted purchases.

Of the

$7.4 million

of net after-tax losses, representing both open foreign currency exchange contracts and open commodity contracts, approximately

$7.4 million

of these losses would be realized in earnings during the twelve months ending December 31, 2016,  and

zero

of net losses would be realized subsequent to December 31, 2016, if spot rates in the future are consistent with forward rates as of

December 31, 2015

. The actual effect on earnings will be dependent on the actual spot rates when the forecasted transactions occur. We recognize derivative gains and losses in the “Costs of sales and services” line in the consolidated statements of income.

Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments

We hold certain forward contracts that have not been designated as cash flow hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Contracts used to hedge the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities are



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

not designated as cash flow hedging instruments, and changes in the fair value of these items are recorded in earnings. We periodically hold soybean barter contracts which qualify as derivatives and we have entered into offsetting commodity contracts to hedge our exposure. Both the change in fair value of the soybean barter contracts and the offsetting commodity contracts are recorded in earnings.

We had open forward contracts not designated as cash flow hedging instruments for accounting purposes with various expiration dates to buy, sell or exchange foreign currencies with a U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately

$1.8 billion

at

December 31, 2015

Fair-Value Measurements

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers or sellers in the principle or most advantageous market for the asset or liability that are independent of the reporting entity, knowledgeable and able and willing to transact for the asset or liability.



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Fair-Value Hierarchy

We have categorized our assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair-value hierarchy. The fair-value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure the assets and liabilities fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair-value measurement of the instrument.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements

The following tables present our fair-value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair-value on a recurring basis in our consolidated balance sheets.

Note 18: Guarantees, Commitments and Contingencies

Guarantees

We continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to guarantees and indemnifications to identify whether a liability must be recognized in our financial statements.

The following table provides the estimated undiscounted amount of potential future payments for each major group of guarantees at

December 31, 2015

. These guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates. Non-performance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation requiring us to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee. Based on our experience these types of guarantees have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or on our liquidity. Our expectation is that future payment or performance related to the non-performance of others is considered unlikely.

____________________

(1)

Represents guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain FMC Agricultural Solutions customers for their seasonal borrowing. This amount is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as “Guarantees of vendor financing.”

(2)

These guarantees represent support provided to third-party banks for credit extended to various FMC Agricultural Solutions customers and nonconsolidated affiliates. The liability for the guarantees is recorded at an amount that approximates fair-value (i.e. representing the stand-ready obligation) based on our historical collection experience and a current assessment of credit exposure. We believe the fair-value of these guarantees is immaterial. The majority of these guarantees have an expiration date of less than one year.

Excluded from the chart above, in connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures, we have agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain liabilities, including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale or provided guarantees to third parties relating to certain contracts assumed by the buyer. Our indemnification or guarantee obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible, minimum claim amount or cap. As such, it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. If triggered, we may be able to recover some of the indemnity payments from third parties. We have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees.



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Commitments

Leases

We lease office space, plants and facilities, and various types of manufacturing, data processing and transportation equipment. Leases of real estate generally provide for our payment of property taxes, insurance and repairs. Our capital leases primarily relate to our two research and technology centers in the U.S. and China. Our capital lease asset balances (net of accumulated amortization of

$2.0 million

and

$1.4 million

), which are classified as buildings within our property, plant and equipment on our consolidated balance sheets, were

$28.1 million

and

$28.7 million

as of

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively. Amortization of capital lease assets is included within depreciation expense. See Note 20 within these consolidated financial statements for obligations associated with our capital leases.

Purchase Obligations

Our minimum commitments under our take-or-pay purchase obligations associated with the sourcing of materials and energy total approximately

$33.4 million

. Since the majority of our minimum obligations under these contracts are over the life of the contract a year-by-year basis, we are unable to determine the periods in which these obligations could be payable under these contracts. However, we intend to fulfill the obligations associated with these contracts through our purchases associated with the normal course of business.

Contingencies

Competition / antitrust litigation related to the discontinued FMC Peroxygens segment.

We are subject to actions brought by private plaintiffs relating to alleged violations of European and Canadian competition and antitrust laws, as further described below.

European competition action

. Multiple European purchasers of hydrogen peroxide who claim to have been harmed as a result of alleged violations of European competition law by hydrogen peroxide producers assigned their legal claims to a single entity formed by a law firm. The single entity then filed a lawsuit in Germany in March 2009 against European producers, including our wholly-owned Spanish subsidiary, Foret. Initial defense briefs were filed in April 2010, and an initial hearing was held during the first quarter of 2011, at which time case management issues were discussed. At a subsequent hearing in October 2011, the Court indicated that it was considering seeking guidance from the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) as to whether the German courts have jurisdiction over these claims. After submission of written comments on this issue by the parties, on March 1, 2012, the judge announced that she would refer the jurisdictional issues to the ECJ, which she did on April 29, 2013. On May 21, 2015, the ECJ issued its decision, upholding the jurisdiction of the German court. The case is now back before the German judge. We filed a motion to dismiss the proceedings in September 2015. We do not anticipate a response by the court until the second quarter of 2016. Since the case is in the preliminary stages and is based on a novel procedure - namely the attempt to create a cross-border “class action” which is not a recognized proceeding under EU or German law - we are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of our potential exposure of loss at this time. We intend to vigorously defend this matter.



FMC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Canadian antitrust actions

.  In 2005, after public disclosures of the U.S. federal grand jury investigation into the hydrogen peroxide industry (which resulted in no charges brought against us) and the filing of various class actions in U.S. federal and state courts, which have all been settled, putative class actions against us and

five

other major hydrogen peroxide producers were filed in provincial courts in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia under the laws of Canada. The other

five

defendants have settled these claims for a total of approximately

$20.6 million

. On September 28, 2009, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice certified a class of direct and indirect purchasers of hydrogen peroxide from 1994 to 2005. Our motion for leave to appeal the class certification decision was denied in June 2010. The case was largely dormant while the Canadian Supreme Court considered, in different litigation, whether indirect purchasers may recover overcharges in antitrust actions. In October 2013 the Court ruled that such recovery is permissible. The Court has approved, the plaintiffs' request have now moved to dismiss certain downstream purchasers (those who purchased products that contain hydrogen peroxided or were made using hydrogen peroxide) from the case and to reduce the class period to November 1, 1998 through December 31, 2003 - thereby eliminating six of the eleven years of the originally certified class period. Since the proceedings are in the preliminary stages with respect to the merits, we are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of our potential exposure of loss at this time. We intend to vigorously defend these matters.

Asbestos claims

. Like hundreds of other industrial companies, we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestos-related personal injury litigation. Most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of FMC or to asbestos-containing components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations.

We intend to continue managing these asbestos-related cases in accordance with our historical experience. We have established a reserve for this litigation within our discontinued operations and believe that any exposure of a loss in excess of the established reserve cannot be reasonably estimated. Our experience has been that the overall trends in asbestos litigation have changed over time. Over the last several years, we have seen changes in the jurisdictions where claims against FMC are being filed and changes in the mix of products named in the various claims. Because these claim trends have yet to form a predictable pattern, we are presently unable to reasonably estimate our asbestos liability with respect to claims that may be filed in the future.

Other contingent liabilities

.  In addition to the matters disclosed above, we have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation, claims, products we have sold, guarantees or warranties we have made, contracts we have entered into, indemnities we have provided, and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business. Some of these contingencies are known - for example pending product liability litigation or claims - but are so preliminary that the merits cannot be determined, or if more advanced, are not deemed material based on current knowledge; and some are unknown - for example, claims with respect to which we have no notice or claims which may arise in the future, resulting from products we have sold, guarantees or warranties we have made, or indemnities we have provided. Therefore, we are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of our potential exposure of loss for these contingencies, either individually or in the aggregate, at this time. Based on information currently available and established reserves, we have no reason to believe that the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies, including the matters described in this Note, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable, and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations in any one reporting period, or liquidity.

See Note 10 for the Pocatello tribal litigation and Middleport litigation for legal proceedings associated with our environmental contingencies.

Note 19: Segment Information

____________________

(1)

Our FMC Agricultural Solutions, FMC Health and Nutrition and FMC Lithium segments each have one product line group, and therefore net sales to external customers within each of those segments are included in the table above.

(2)

See Note 7 for details of restructuring and other charges (income). Below provides the detail the charges (income) by segment:

(3)

Our non-operating pension and postretirement costs are defined as those costs related to interest, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements. These costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and we consider these costs to be outside our operational performance. We exclude these non-operating pension and postretirement costs from our segments as we believe that removing them provides a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our businesses, provides increased transparency and clarity in the performance of our retirement plans and enhances period-over-period comparability. We continue to include the service cost and amortization of prior service cost in our operating segments noted above. We believe these elements reflect the current year operating costs to our businesses for the employment benefits provided to active employees. These expenses are included as a component of the line item "Selling, general and administrative expenses" on our consolidated statements of income.

(4)

Charges are associated with the previously planned separation of FMC Corporation into two independent public companies. On September 8, 2014, we announced that we would no longer proceed with the planned separation of FMC into two distinct public entities. At that time we announced the acquisition of Cheminova; see Note 3 within these consolidated financial statements for more information. These charges are included within "Business separation costs" on our consolidated income statement. These costs were

FMC Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FMC Corporation and subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2015

and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2015

. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the related financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FMC Corporation and subsidiaries as of

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). FMC’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of FMC;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;

•

provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of FMC are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of FMC; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2015

. We based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework (COSO 2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We reviewed the results of our assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

FMC acquired Cheminova A/S during 2015, and we excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of FMC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, Cheminova A/S’s internal control over financial reporting which represented 33% of FMC’s consolidated total assets (including amounts resulting from the purchase price allocation) and 14% of consolidated revenues as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2015

.

Based on this assessment, we determined that, as of

December 31, 2015

, FMC has effective internal control over financial reporting.

KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2015

, which appears on the following page.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

FMC Corporation:

We have audited FMC Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)

.

FMC Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, FMC Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

FMC Corporation acquired Cheminova A/S during 2015, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of FMC Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, Cheminova A/S’s internal control over financial reporting which represented 33% of FMC Corporation’s consolidated total assets (including amounts resulting from the purchase price allocation) and 14% of consolidated revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of FMC Corporation also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Cheminova A/S.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of FMC Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015,

and our report dated February 26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on management’s evaluation (with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer), the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(c) The scope of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting included the Company’s consolidated operations except for the operations of Cheminova A/S, which FMC acquired on April 21, 2015.  Cheminova A/S represented 33% of the Company’s total assets (including amounts resulting from the purchase price allocation) and 14% of the consolidated revenue as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Cheminova will be included within scope of management's assessment of its internal control over financial reporting in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2016.



ITEM 9B.    OTHER INFORMATION

On February 18, 2013, in order to more closely align the Company’s incentive compensation clawback practices and policies with Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (which added Section 10D to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a Clawback Policy (the “Clawback Policy”), applicable to all cash and equity incentive compensation thereafter granted to executive officers of the Company.

On February 25, 2016, the Compensation and Organization Committee adopted an amendment to the FMC Corporation Incentive Compensation and Stock Plan, as amended (the “Plan”) to confirm that all awards of cash and equity incentive compensation made to executive officers of the Company pursuant to the Plan are subject to the forfeiture, clawback, disgorgement and other provisions set forth in the Clawback Policy, as the same shall be in effect from time to time.
