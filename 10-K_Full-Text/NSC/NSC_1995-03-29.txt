          GENERAL - Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern)
was incorporated on July 23, 1980, under the laws of the Commonwealth
of Virginia.  On June l, 1982, Norfolk Southern acquired control of
two major operating railroads, Norfolk and Western Railway Company
(NW) and Southern Railway Company (Southern).  In accordance with an
Agreement of Merger and Reorganization dated as of July 31, 1980, and
related Plans of Merger, and with the approval of the transaction by
the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), each issued share of NW's
common stock was converted into one share of Norfolk Southern Common
Stock and each issued share of Southern common stock was converted
into l.9 shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock.  The outstanding
shares of Southern's preferred stock remained outstanding without
change.

          Effective December 31, 1990, Norfolk Southern transferred
all the common stock of NW to Southern, and Southern's name was
changed to Norfolk Southern Railway Company (Norfolk Southern
Railway).  As of February 28, 1995, all the common stock of NW
(100 percent voting control) is owned by Norfolk Southern Railway, and
all the common stock of Norfolk Southern Railway and 9.6 percent of
its preferred stock (resulting in 94.4 percent voting control) are
owned directly by Norfolk Southern.

          On June 21, 1985, Norfolk Southern acquired control of North
American Van Lines, Inc. and its subsidiaries (NAVL), a diversified
motor carrier.  In accordance with an Acquisition Agreement dated May
2, 1984, and with the approval of the transaction by the ICC, Norfolk
Southern acquired all the issued and outstanding common stock of NAVL
from PepsiCo, Inc.  During 1993, NAVL underwent a restructuring (see
discussion on page 6 and in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on page 71) designed to enhance its opportunities to return
to profitability.

          Unless indicated otherwise, Norfolk Southern and its
subsidiaries are referred to collectively as NS.

          RAILROAD OPERATIONS - As of December 31, 1994, NS'
railroads operated 14,652 miles of road in the states of Alabama,
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West
Virginia, and the Province of Ontario, Canada.  Of this total,
12,780 miles are owned, 677 miles are leased and 1,195 miles are
operated under trackage rights; also, of this total, 11,991 miles
are main line and 2,661 miles are branch line.  In addition, NS'
railroads operate approximately 10,907 miles of passing, industrial,
yard and side tracks.

  PAGE 5


          NS' railroads have major leased lines in North Carolina and
between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Chattanooga, Tennessee.  The North
Carolina leases, covering approximately 300 miles, expired by their
terms at the end of 1994.  However, NS expects these leases to be
renewed or extended and NS' railroads have reached tentative
understandings for such renewal or extension.  The tentative
arrangements call for payment of an annual rental of $8 million in
1995, with inflation adjustments in succeeding years.  Pending the
approval of a form of lease extension agreement by the parties, NS'
railroads continue to operate over these lines under the terms of the
expired leases.  If these leases ultimately are not renewed or
extended, NS' railroads could be required to continue using the lines
subject to conditions prescribed by the ICC or they might find it
necessary to operate over an alternate route or routes.  It is not
expected that the resolution of this matter (whether resulting in
renewal or extension of the leases, continued use of the leased lines
under prescribed conditions or operation over one or more alternate
routes) will have a material effect on NS' consolidated financial
position.

          The Cincinnati-Chattanooga lease, covering about 335 miles,
expires in 2026, subject to an option to extend the lease for an
additional 25 years at terms to be agreed upon.

          NS' lines carry raw materials, intermediate products and
finished goods primarily in the Southeast and Midwest and to and
from the rest of the United States and parts of Canada.  These lines
also transport overseas freight through several Atlantic and Gulf
Coast ports.  Atlantic ports served by NS include:  Norfolk, Va.;
Morehead City, N.C.; Charleston, S.C.; Savannah and Brunswick, Ga.;
and Jacksonville, Fl.  Gulf Coast ports served include:  Mobile,
Al., and New Orleans, La.

          The lines of NS' railroads reach most of the larger
industrial and trading centers of the Southeast and Midwest, with
the exception of those in central and southern Florida.  Atlanta,
Birmingham, New Orleans, Memphis, St. Louis, Kansas City (Missouri),
Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati, Buffalo, Norfolk, Charleston, Savannah
and Jacksonville are among the leading centers originating and
terminating freight traffic on the system.  In addition to serving
other established centers, the system's lines reach many industries,
mines (in western Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southern West
Virginia) and businesses located in smaller communities in its
service area.  The traffic corridors carrying the heaviest volumes
of freight include those from the Appalachian coal fields of
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky to Norfolk and Sandusky, Oh.;
Buffalo to Chicago and Kansas City; Chicago to Jacksonville (via
Cincinnati, Chattanooga and Atlanta); and Washington,
D.C./Hagerstown, Md., to New Orleans (via Atlanta and Birmingham).

          Buffalo, Chicago, Hagerstown, Jacksonville, Kansas City,
Memphis, New Orleans and St. Louis are major gateways for
interterritorial system traffic.

          NS rail subsidiaries and other railroads have entered into
service interruption agreements, effective December 30, 1994,
providing indemnities to parties affected by a strike over specified
industry issues.  If NS were so affected, it could receive daily

  PAGE 6


indemnities from non-affected parties; if parties other than NS were
affected, NS could be required to pay indemnities to those parties.
If NS were required to pay the maximum amount of indemnities
required of it under these agreements--an event considered unlikely
at this time--such liability should not exceed approximately $85
million.

          MOTOR CARRIER OPERATIONS - DOMESTIC OPERATIONS - NAVL's
principal transportation activity now is the domestic, irregular route
common and contract carriage of used household goods and special
commodities between points in the United States.  NAVL also operates
as an intrastate carrier of property in 19 states.

          Prior to its restructuring in 1993, NAVL's domestic motor
carrier business was organized into three primary divisions:
Relocation Services (RS) specializing in residential relocation of
used household goods; High Value Products (HVP) specializing in office
and industrial relocations and transporting exhibits; and Commercial
Transport (CT) specializing in the transportation of truckload
shipments of general commodities.  In 1993, NAVL underwent a
restructuring involving termination of the CT Division and sale of the
operations of Tran-Star, Inc. (Tran-Star), NAVL's refrigerated
trucking subsidiary.  In 1993, NAVL discontinued CT's operations,
transferred some parts of CT's business to other divisions and began
selling CT's assets that were not needed in NAVL's other operations.
The sale of Tran-Star's operations was completed on December 31, 1993.

          During 1994, the RS and HVP divisions conducted operations
through agents at 696 locations in the United States.  Agents are
local moving and storage companies that provide NAVL with such
services as solicitation, packing and warehousing in connection with
the movement of household goods and specialized products.  NAVL's
future domestic operations are expected to be conducted principally
through the RS and HVP divisions.

           Customized Logistics Services (CLS) was established in 1993
as an operating unit of the HVP Division.  CLS' business is to focus
NAVL's resources to respond to a variety of customer needs for
integrated logistics services.  The services include emergency parts
order fulfillment, time-definite transportation and in-transit
merge programs.

          FOREIGN OPERATIONS - NAVL's foreign operations are conducted
through the RS and HVP Divisions and through foreign subsidiaries,
including North American Van Lines Canada, Ltd.  The latter subsidiary
provides motor carrier service for the transportation of used
household goods and specialized commodities between most points in
Canada through a network of approximately 179 agent locations.  NAVL's
international operations consist primarily of forwarding used
household goods to and from the United States and between foreign
countries through a network of approximately 330 foreign agents and
representatives.  NAVL's international operations are structurally
aligned with the services provided by its domestic operating
divisions.  All international household goods operations and related
subsidiaries in Alaska, Canada and Panama are assigned to the RS
Division.  The remaining international operations, which include
subsidiaries in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom,

  PAGE 7


are involved in the transportation of selected general and 
specialized commodities and are assigned to the HVP Division.

          TRIPLE CROWN OPERATIONS - Until April 1993, Norfolk
Southern's intermodal subsidiary, Triple Crown Services, Inc. (TCS),
offered intermodal service using RoadRailer (Registered
Trademark) (RT) equipment and domestic containers.  RoadRailer(RT)
units are enclosed vans which can be pulled over highways in tractor-
trailer configuration and over the rails by locomotives.  On April 1,
1993, the business, name and operations of TCS were transferred to
Triple Crown Services Company (TCSC), a partnership in which
subsidiaries of Norfolk Southern and Consolidated Rail Corporation
(CR) are equal partners.  RoadRailer(RT) equipment owned or leased by
TCS (which was renamed TCS Leasing, Inc.) is operated by TCSC.
Because NS indirectly owns only 50 percent of TCSC, the revenues of
TCSC are not consolidated with the results of NS.  TCSC offers door-to-
door intermodal service using RoadRailer(RT) equipment and domestic
containers in the corridors previously served by TCS, as well as
service to the New York and New Jersey markets via CR.  Major traffic
corridors include those between New York and Chicago, Chicago and
Atlanta, and Atlanta and New York.

          TRANSPORTATION OPERATING REVENUES - NS' total transportation
operating revenues were $4.58 billion in 1994.  These revenues were
received for the transportation of revenue freight: 282.7 million tons
by rail and 0.9 million tons by motor carrier.  Of the rail tonnage,
approximately 221.9 million tons originated on line, approximately
242.8 million tons terminated on line (including 187.9 million tons of
local traffic -- originating and terminating on line) and
approximately 5.9 million tons was overhead traffic (neither
originating nor terminating on line).

          Revenue and revenue ton mile (one ton of freight moved one
mile) contributions by principal transportation operating revenue
sources for the period 1990 through 1994 are set forth in the
following table:


  PAGE 8



  PAGE 9



  PAGE 10


          COAL TRAFFIC - Ranked by tons handled, coal, coke and iron
ore--most of which is bituminous coal--is NS' railroads' principal
commodity group.  NS' railroads originated 114.7 million tons of coal,
coke and iron ore in 1994 and handled a total of 125.9 million tons.
Originated tonnage increased 2.3 percent from 112.1 million tons in
1993, and total tons handled increased 6.7 percent from 118.0 million
tons in 1993.  Revenues from coal, coke and iron ore, which accounted
for 28 percent of NS' total transportation operating revenues and
36 percent of total revenue ton miles in 1994, were $1.26 billion, an
increase of 4 percent from $1.21 billion in 1993.

          The following table shows total coal tonnage originated on-
line, received from connections and handled for the five years ended
December 31, 1994:


          Of the 112.0 million tons of coal originating on NS railroad
lines in 1994, the approximate breakdown by origin state is as
follows:   41.2 million tons from West Virginia, 36.5 million tons
from Virginia, 23.6 million tons from Kentucky, 5.7 million tons from
Alabama, 3.0 million tons from Illinois, 1.5 million tons from
Tennessee, and 0.5 million tons from Indiana.  Of this NS-origin coal,
approximately 25.0 million tons moved for export, principally through
NS pier facilities at Norfolk (Lamberts Point), Va.; 18.3 million tons
moved to domestic and Canadian steel industries; 59.8 million tons of
steam coal moved to electric utilities; and 8.9 million tons moved to
other industrial and miscellaneous users.  NS' railroads moved
10.4 million tons of originated coal to various docks on the Ohio
River for further movement by barge and 5.2 million tons to various
Lake Erie ports.  Other than coal for export, virtually all coal
handled by NS' railroads was terminated in states situated east of the
Mississippi River.

          Total coal tonnage handled through all system ports in 1994
was 43.6 million.  Of this total, 64 percent moved through the pier
facilities at Lamberts Point.  In 1994, total tonnage handled at
Lamberts Point, including coastwise traffic, was 27.8 million tons, a
0.7 percent increase from the 27.6 million tons handled in 1993.

  PAGE 11


          For the five years ended December 31, 1994, the quantities
of NS coal handled only for export through Lamberts Point were as
follows:



          See the discussion of coal traffic, by type of coal, in
Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis," on page 34.

          MERCHANDISE RAIL TRAFFIC - The merchandise traffic group
consists of Intermodal and five major commodity groupings (Chemicals;
Paper/Forest; Automotive; Agriculture; and Metals/Construction).
Total NS railroad merchandise revenues increased in 1994 to
$2.54 billion, a 6 percent increase over 1993.  Railroad merchandise
carloads handled in 1994 were 3.03 million, compared with 2.82 million
handled in 1993, an increase of 8 percent.

          Intermodal results reflect the effect of the formation, in
April 1993, of TCSC, a partnership between NS and Conrail subsidiaries
(see also page 7).  This partnership provides RoadRailer(RT) and
domestic container services previously offered by a wholly owned NS
subsidiary.  Because NS owns only 50 percent of TCSC, its revenues are
not consolidated, and NS' 1994 and 1993 intermodal revenues include
only revenues for rail service provided by NS to the partnership.
Excluding this partnership effect, 1994 intermodal revenues increased
14%, compared with 1993, and 1993 intermodal revenues increased 10
percent, compared with 1992.

          In 1994, 106.4 million tons of merchandise freight, or
approximately 68 percent of total rail merchandise tonnage handled by
NS, originated on line.  The balance of NS' railroad merchandise
traffic was received from connecting carriers (mostly railroads, with
some intermodal, water and highway as well), usually at
interterritorial gateways.  The principal interchange points for NS-
received traffic included Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, Cincinnati,
Kansas City, Detroit, Hagerstown, St. Louis/East St. Louis and
Louisville.

           Revenues in all six market groups comprising merchandise
traffic improved over 1993, with four of the six increasing by 8% or
more.  The biggest gains were in Intermodal, up $53.6 million
(adjusted for the effect of the TCSC partnership); Chemicals, up $39.3
million; Agriculture, up $27.8 million; and Metals/Construction, up
$25.3 million.

           See the discussion of merchandise rail traffic by commodity
group in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis," on
page 34.
  PAGE 12


          MOTOR CARRIER TRAFFIC - NAVL's traffic volume decreased
during 1994 due to the restructuring in 1993 (see page 6).  Total
motor carrier revenues were $663.2 million, down 7 percent from 1993,
which included six months of revenues from the subsequently discontinued 
operations prior to the restructuring of NAVL.  Adjusted for the effect 
of discontinued truckload operations in 1993, motor carrier operating 
revenues in 1994 increased 15 percent.  NAVL's expenses decreased 
17 percent in 1994, also resulting from the restructuring.

          DOMESTIC OPERATIONS now are conducted through NAVL's RS and
HVP divisions.  In 1994, total domestic shipments for these divisions
were 379,294, up 8 percent from 1993.  Further comments about each
division follow.

          Domestic shipments of used household goods transported by
the RS Division fall into three market categories.  Approximately
50 percent of the domestic shipment volume comes from the sale of
moving services to individual consumers.  Another 38 percent comes
from corporations and other businesses that pay for the relocation of
their employees.  The remaining 12 percent is derived from military,
government and other sources.  Total domestic RS Division shipments in
1994 represented 31 percent of the NAVL domestic motor carrier
shipments transported by the two primary divisions.  Total domestic
revenues from this division were up 5 percent, compared with 1993, and
represented 43 percent of total revenues from operations.

          The HVP Division specializes in providing transportation
services in less-than-truckload (LTL) and truckload (TL) quantities of
sensitive products.  These products are divided into the following
categories:  office furniture and equipment, exhibits and displays,
electronic equipment, industrial machinery, commercial relocation, LTL
furniture and selected general commodities.  Total HVP Division
shipments transported in 1994, including TL and LTL, represented
69 percent of the NAVL domestic motor carrier shipments transported by
the two primary divisions.  Revenues from this division were up
29 percent from 1993 levels and represented 46 percent of total
revenues from operations.

          The operations of the CT Division were discontinued in 1993.
Total CT Division shipments transported in 1993 represented 36 percent
of NAVL's total domestic motor carrier shipments transported for the
entire year by the three primary divisions.  Revenues from this
division were down 50 percent in 1993 compared with 1992 levels and
represented 19 percent of total revenues from operations.

          FOREIGN OPERATIONS include NAVL's Canadian subsidiary, North
American Van Lines Canada, Ltd., as well as operating subsidiaries in
England, Germany and Panama.  Foreign operations involving the
transportation of used household goods and selected general and
specialized commodities generated revenues of $71.1 million in 1994,
up 3 percent from 1993.  Revenues from foreign operations represented
11 percent of NAVL's total revenues.

          FREIGHT RATES - In 1994 NS' railroads continued their
reliance on private contracts and exempt price quotes as their
predominant pricing mechanisms.  Thus, a major portion of NS'
railroads' freight business is not economically regulated by the
government.  In general, market forces have been substituted for
government regulation and now are the primary determinant of rail
service prices.  Proposals pending in Congress in early 1995 would
further reduce rate regulation of railroads.

          In 1994, the ICC found NS' railroads "revenue inadequate"
based on results for the year 1993.  A railroad is "revenue
inadequate" under the Interstate Commerce Act when its return on net
investment does not exceed the rail industry's composite cost of
capital.  The absence of "revenue adequacy" lets a railroad use a
provision in the Interstate Commerce Act allowing increases in
regulated rates by a specific percentage.  However, with the
decreasing importance of regulated tariff traffic to NS' railroads,
the ICC's "revenue adequacy" findings have less impact than
formerly.
  PAGE 14


          Pricing and service flexibility afforded by the Motor
Carrier Act of 1980 and the Household Goods Transportation Act of
1980 has resulted in NAVL's increased emphasis on innovative pricing
action in order to remain competitive.  Since 1980, NAVL has
increasingly operated as a contract carrier.  As of December 31,
1994, domestic contract carriage agreements accounted for the
following percentage of shipments:  RS Division, 28 percent and 
HVP Division, 80 percent.

          PASSENGER OPERATIONS - Regularly scheduled passenger
operations on NS' lines consist of Amtrak trains operating between
Alexandria and New Orleans, and between Charlotte and Selma, N.C.
Former Amtrak operations between East St. Louis and Centralia, Il.,
were discontinued by Amtrak on November 3, 1993.  Commuter trains
continued operations on the NS line between Manassas and Alexandria
under contract with two transportation commissions of the
Commonwealth of Virginia, providing for reimbursement of related
expenses incurred by NS.  During 1993, a lease of the Chicago to
Manhattan, Il., line to the Commuter Rail Division of the Regional
Transportation Authority of Northeast Illinois replaced an agreement
under which NS had provided commuter rail service for the Authority.

          NONCARRIER OPERATIONS - Norfolk Southern's noncarrier
subsidiaries engage principally in the acquisition and subsequent leasing
of coal, oil, gas and timberlands, the development of commercial real
estate and the leasing or sale of rail property and equipment.  In 1994,
no such noncarrier subsidiary or industry segment grouping of noncarrier
subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment set
forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 14.

          In January 1994, certain Norfolk Southern subsidiaries
purchased rights with respect to an estimated 210 million recoverable
tons of coal located primarily in eastern Kentucky and southern West
Virginia.  The cash purchase price for the acquisition was $71 million.
These coal reserves have been leased to various producers who operate and
mine the properties under long-term leases providing royalty income to NS.

          The average age of the freight car fleet at December 31,
1994, was 21.9 years.  During 1994, NS retired 3,333 freight cars.  As
of December 31, 1994, the average age of the locomotive fleet was
15.8 years.  During 1994, NS retired 24 locomotives, the average age
of which was 23.6 years.  Since 1988, NS has rebodied more than
17,200 coal cars.  As a result, the remaining serviceability of the
freight car fleet is greater than is indicated by the percentage of
freight cars built in earlier years.

          NS continues freight car and locomotive maintenance programs
to ensure the highest standards of safety, reliability, customer
satisfaction and equipment marketability.  In recent years, as
illustrated in the table below, the bad order ratio has risen or
remained fairly stable primarily due to the storage of certain types
of cars which are not in high demand.  Funds were not spent to repair
cars for which present and future customers' needs could be adequately
met without such repair programs.  Also, NS' own standards of what
constitutes a "serviceable" car have risen, and NS continues its
disposition program for underutilized, unserviceable and overage cars.


  PAGE 17


          TRACKAGE - All NS trackage is standard gauge, and the rail
in approximately 96 percent of the main line trackage (including
first, second, third and branch main tracks, all excluding trackage
rights) is heavyweight rail ranging from 90 to 155 pounds per yard.
Of the 23,172 miles of track maintained by NS as of December 31, 1994,
15,712 were laid with welded rail.





          MICROWAVE SYSTEM - The NS microwave system, consisting of
6,584 radio path miles, 374 active stations and 7 passive repeater
stations, provides communications for Norfolk, Buffalo, Detroit, Fort
Wayne, Chicago, Kansas City, St. Louis, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, New
Orleans, Jacksonville, Memphis, Cincinnati and most operating
locations between these cities.  The microwave system provides
approximately 2,168,990 individual voice channel miles of circuits.
The microwave system is used principally for voice communications,
VHF radio control circuits, data and facsimile transmissions, traffic
control operations, AEI data transmissions and relay of intelligence
from defective equipment detectors.  Extension of microwave
communications to low density or operations support facilities is
accomplished via microwave interface to buried fiber-optic or copper
cables.

  PAGE 18


          TRAFFIC CONTROL - Of a total of 13,457 road miles operated
by NS, excluding trackage rights over foreign lines, 5,274 road miles
are governed by centralized traffic control systems (of which 81 miles
are controlled by data radio from seven microwave site locations) and
2,734 road miles are equipped for automatic block system operation.

          COMPUTERS - Data processing facilities connect the yards,
terminals, transportation offices, rolling stock repair points, sales
offices and other key locations on NS to the central computer complex
in Atlanta, Ga.  System operating and traffic data are compiled and
stored to provide customers with information on their shipments
throughout the system.  Data processing facilities are capable of
providing current information on the location of every train and each
car on line, as well as related waybill and other train and car
movement data.  Additionally, this facility affords substantial
capacity for, and is utilized to assist management in the performance
of, a wide variety of functions and services, including payroll, car
and revenue accounting, billing, material management activities and
controls, and special studies.

          OTHER - NS has extensive facilities for support of railroad
operations, including freight depots, car construction shops,
maintenance shops, office buildings, and signals and communications
facilities.

          MOTOR CARRIER PROPERTY:

          REAL ESTATE - NAVL owns and leases real estate in support of
its operations.  Principal real estate holdings include NAVL's
headquarters complex and warehouse and vehicle maintenance facilities
in Fort Wayne, Indiana, vehicle maintenance facilities in Fontana,
California, and terminal facilities in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and
Great Falls, Montana.  NAVL also leases facilities throughout the
United States for sales offices, maintenance facilities and for
warehouse, terminal and distribution center operations.

          EQUIPMENT - NAVL relies extensively on independent
contractors (owner-operators) who supply the power equipment
(tractors) used to pull NAVL trailers.  Agents also provide a
substantial portion of NAVL's equipment needs, particularly for the
transportation of household goods, by furnishing tractors and trailers
on either a permanent or an intermittent lease basis.

          As of December 31, 1994, agents and owner-operators together
supplied 3,531 tractors, representing 97 percent of the U.S. power
equipment operated in NAVL service.  Also as of December 31, 1994,
NAVL owned 3,028 trailer units, representing 55 percent of the U.S.
trailer fleet in NAVL service.  The remaining 45 percent was provided
mainly by agents and owner-operators.  Agents and owner-operators also
provided 1,088 straight trucks, or 98 percent of such units in NAVL
service.

          NAVL has an extensive program for the repair and maintenance
of its trailer equipment.  In 1994, work orders on approximately
15,475 trailers were completed at NAVL's facility in Fort Wayne.  As
of December 31, 1994, the average age of trailer equipment in the NAVL
fleet was 7.9 years.

  PAGE 19


          COMPUTERS - NAVL relies extensively on data processing
facilities for shipment planning and dispatch functions as well as
shipment tracing.  Data processing capabilities are also utilized in
revenue processing functions, driver and agent account settlement
activity, and internal accounting and record keeping service.

          ENCUMBRANCES - Certain railroad equipment is subject to the
prior lien of equipment financing obligations amounting to
approximately $520.9 million as of December 31, 1994, and
$551.4 million at December 31, 1993.  In addition, a significant
portion of NS' properties is subject to liens securing, as of December
31, 1994, and 1993, approximately $83.9 million and $125.9 million of
mortgage debt, respectively.

          Many of the tractors utilized in NAVL service are purchased
by NAVL from manufacturers and resold to agents and owner-operators
under a NAVL-sponsored financing program.  At December 31, 1994, NAVL
had $21.3 million in such tractor contracts receivable.  This program
allows NAVL to generate the funds necessary to purchase the tractors
and to resell them under favorable financing terms.  The equipment is
sold under conditional sales contracts with the agents and owner-
operators.



           NS' capital spending and maintenance programs are and have
been designed to assure NS' ability to provide safe, efficient and
reliable transportation services.  For 1995, NS is planning $695 million 
of capital spending, of which $686 million will be for railway
projects and $9 million for motor carrier property.  NS anticipates
new equipment financing of approximately $110 million in 1995.
Looking further ahead, total rail and motor carrier capital spending
is expected to remain in the $600 to $700 million range for the next
few years.  A substantial portion of future capital spending is
expected to be funded through internally generated cash, although debt
financing will continue as the primary funding source for equipment
acquisitions.
  PAGE 20


          ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS - Compliance with federal, state and
local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment is a principal NS goal.  To date, such compliance has not
affected materially NS' capital additions, earnings, liquidity or
competitive position.

          See the discussion of "Environmental Matters" in Part II,
Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis" on page 34, and in
Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72.

          EMPLOYEES - NS employed an average of 27,168 employees in
1994, compared with an average of 29,304 in 1993.  The approximate
average cost per employee during 1994 was $40,667 in wages and $17,417
in employee benefits.  Approximately 75 percent of these employees are
represented by various labor organizations.

          GOVERNMENT REGULATION - In addition to environmental,
safety, securities and other regulations generally applicable to all
businesses, NS' railroads are subject to regulation by the ICC,
various state regulatory agencies and the Department of
Transportation.  The ICC has jurisdiction over many rates, routes,
conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.
The ICC also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger or
acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers.  The Department
of Transportation regulates certain track and mechanical equipment
standards.

          The relaxation of economic regulation of the railroads by
the ICC, started over a decade ago under the Staggers Rail Act of
1980, has continued.  The ICC has recently authorized the partial
deregulation of the charges railroads pay for the use of rail cars.
NS is expected to benefit from the deprescription of car hire because
it owns older cars of types which are in high demand.  These cars will
likely bring higher rentals under deprescription than under regulated
rates.

          Certain revenue transactions and classes of traffic have
been exempted from ICC regulation.  Those most significant for NS'
railroads are TOFC/COFC (i.e., "piggyback") business, rail boxcar
traffic, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles and certain bulk
commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood and wood chips for paper
manufacturing.  Transportation contracts on regulated shipments, after
approval by the ICC, effectively remove those shipments from
regulation as well.  Over 80 percent of NS' freight revenues come from
either exempt traffic or traffic moving under ICC-approved
transportation contracts.

          In early 1995, Congress had under consideration proposals
for additional reductions in economic regulation of railroads,
including proposals for "sunsetting" the ICC and transferring 
its remaining functions to another agency.

          For motor carrier operations conducted by NAVL, the ICC and
Department of Transportation remain the principal regulatory entities.
The ICC continues to exercise jurisdiction over common carrier rates,
the relationship between carriers and owner-operators, and carrier
practices relating to the transportation of household goods.  The
primary focus of the Department of Transportation is on driver
qualification and safety standards, including maximum trailer length
and width.
  PAGE 21


          COMPETITION - There is continuing strong competition among
rail, water and highway carriers.  Price is usually only one factor of
importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and
specific hauling company.  Inventory carrying costs, service
reliability, ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage
during transit are increasingly important considerations, especially
for higher valued finished goods, machinery and consumer products.
Even for raw materials, semi-finished goods and work-in-process,
users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements which
minimize problems at successive production stages.

          NS' primary rail competitor is the CSX system; both operate
throughout much of the same territory.  Other railroads also operate
in parts of the territory.  NS also competes with motor carriers,
water carriers and with shippers who have the additional option of
handling their own goods in private carriage.  Increasingly,
cooperative strategies between railroads (such as the TCSC partnership
involving NS and CR, see page 7) and between railroads and motor
carriers enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific
markets.

          NAVL continues to face vigorous competition due to
deregulation and overcapacity in the industry that will keep profits
at a modest level.  While service remains a key issue, many shippers
now place greater emphasis on price.  For the RS Division, contract
carriage and volume discount programs dominate the corporate
relocation segment, and guaranteed price options are common to the
individual consumer segment.  Contract carriage agreements are also
utilized extensively by the HVP Division to meet the service and price
requirements of its customers.

Executive Officers of the Registrant.
-------------------------------------

          Norfolk Southern's officers are elected annually by the
Board of Directors at its first meeting held after the annual meeting
of stockholders, and they hold office until their successors are
elected.  There are no family relationships among the officers, nor
any arrangement or understanding between any officer and any other
person pursuant to which the officer was selected.  The following
table sets forth certain information, as of March 1, 1995, relating to
these officers:

              NORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
                  Management's Discussion and Analysis
            of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
                                    
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes beginning on page 50 and
the Eleven-Year Financial Review beginning on page 27. The Condensed
Summary provides a brief overview of results of operations, and the text
beginning under "Results of Operations" is a more detailed analysis.

CONDENSED SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1994 Compared with 1993
-----------------------
     Net income was $667.8 million, or $4.90 per share, in 1994, compared
with $772.0 million, or $5.54 per share, in 1993. However, net income in
1993 was increased by $223.3 million, or $1.60 per share, related to the
implementation of required accounting changes (see Note 1 on page 56) and
reduced by $46.2 million, or $0.33 per share, for the prior years' effect
of a federal income tax rate increase (see Note 3 on page 58). Excluding
the effect of the 1993 accounting changes and the tax rate increase,
1994's net income was 12% above the $594.9 million in 1993, and earnings
per share were 15% above the $4.27 in 1993, both setting records for NS.
     Income from railway operations rose $128.0 million, or 14%, compared
with 1993, producing most of the improvement. These results reflect a 5%
increase in railway operating revenues (largely due to higher traffic
volume) combined with only a 2% increase in railway operating expenses.
Income from motor carrier operations improved to $22.1 million in 1994,
compared with a $4.6 million loss in 1993 (excluding the 1993
restructuring charge, see Note 15 on page 71). Nonoperating income was
$85.2 million, compared with $136.8 million in 1993 (see Note 2 on
page 58), principally a result of reduced gains on sales of stock and
property.

1993 Compared with 1992
-----------------------
     Net income was $772.0 million in 1993, compared with $557.7 million
in 1992. However, as discussed previously, results for 1993 were
significantly affected by required accounting changes and by an increase
in the federal income tax rate. Excluding the effect of the accounting
changes and the tax rate increase related to prior years, 1993 earnings
would have been $594.9 million, or $4.27 per share, a $37.2 million, or
7%, increase over 1992. Income from railway operations in 1993 was about
even with 1992. Railway operating revenues declined 1%, primarily as a
result of lower coal traffic levels and a reduced share of certain
intermodal revenues after formation of Triple Crown Services Company
(TCSC), a partnership between NS and Consolidated Rail Corporation
(Conrail) subsidiaries. Motor carrier operations resulted in a $54.9
million loss in 1993, largely due to a restructuring of NAVL (see Note 15
on page 71), which resulted in the disposition of two of its businesses.
Offsetting the decline in income from operations was a $39.0 million
increase in nonoperating income, due principally to gains from sales of
stock and property (see Note 2 on page 58).

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Railway Operating Revenues
--------------------------
     Railway operating revenues were $3.92 billion in 1994, compared with
$3.75 billion in 1993 and $3.78 billion in 1992. The following table
presents a three-year comparison of revenues by market group and reflects
(in Intermodal) the effect of the formation in April 1993 of TCSC. This
partnership provides RoadRailer(RT) and domestic container services
previously offered by a wholly owned NS subsidiary. Since NS owns only
50% of TCSC, its revenues are not consolidated, and NS' intermodal
revenues include only revenues for rail service provided by NS to the
partnership. Excluding this partnership effect, 1994 intermodal revenues
increased 14%, compared with 1993, and 1993 intermodal revenues were up
10%, compared with 1992.


     Traffic volume increased or remained steady for all market groups in
1994 and increased for all market groups except coal in 1993. The revenue
per unit/mix variance in both years was attributable to: (1) shorter haul
business that has a lower average rate; (2) increased double-stack
business that has a lower average rate; and (3) the effect of the TCSC
partnership previously described.

          Condition and Results of Operations. (continued)
          -----------------------------------


     Some of the fastest growing market segments are in shorter haul,
repetitive movements. This type of traffic complements NS' efforts to
improve asset utilization and demonstrates that efficient operations can
generate profit opportunities in nontraditional markets.
     COAL (including coke and iron ore) traffic volume in 1994 increased
5%, and revenues, which represented 32% of total railway operating
revenues, were up 4% from 1993. Coal accounted for about 98% of this
market group's volume, and 91% of coal shipments originated on NS' lines.
As shown in the following table, the decline in steel coal was more than
offset by a significant increase in utility coal, up 16%, compared with
1993.


     Utility coal traffic was up early in the year as a result of bitter
weather and the resulting depletion of plant stockpiles. The pace at
which 1994 outperformed 1993 slowed as the weather normalized, power
generation demand lessened and coal inventories grew. New movements of
western coal into Georgia also contributed to the 1994 increase. NS
handled five million tons of western coal in 1994, and this volume is
expected to increase in 1995.
     The favorable outlook for utility coal reflects increasing demand
for low-sulfur coal as utilities seek to comply with Clean Air Act
Amendments. A high proportion of the mines served by NS produce low-
sulfur coal. The January 1, 1995, Phase I deadline under the Clean Air
Act has already caused an increase in NS' low-sulfur coal handlings.
This trend is expected to accelerate as the Phase II deadline of January
1, 2000, approaches.
     Export coal traffic at the beginning of 1994 continued to reflect
the poor demand seen in 1993. Shipments remained depressed as a result of
the weak European economy and strong competition from other producing
countries. Excess world capacity pushed coal prices lower in early 1994.
However, by mid-1994, U.S. coal supplies for the export market had been
reduced due to a strong domestic market and mine closings. Economic
recovery in Europe and Japan improved demand for steel and electricity,
and within a short time the coal supply-demand situation tightened. By
the end of 1994, delivery times were longer and prices had risen.

-------   -------------------------------------------------
          Condition and Results of Operations. (continued)
          -----------------------------------

     Continued economic growth in the Far East and Europe is expected to
increase demand for U.S. coal, especially steam coal. Reduced mining
subsidies in Europe, primarily in Germany, may reduce European coal
production. On the other hand, overseas demand for coal used in
steelmaking is expected to be flat in the short term and to decline over
the longer term as new technologies slowly diminish the need for this
type of coal. On balance, U.S. coal exports are expected to increase, but
at rates below those seen in previous economic recoveries.
     During 1994, NS completed modifications to the two shiploaders at
Pier 6 in Norfolk, Va., enabling large vessels to be loaded more quickly.
     Steel coal domestic traffic was reduced by the closing of one coke
battery and extended maintenance at another battery. These batteries
produce coke for making steel; however, because advancing technologies
allow for production of steel with little or no coke, this domestic
market is expected to decline slowly.
     Coal volume in 1993 decreased 6%, compared with 1992, and revenues
also were down 6%. The export coal market was weak for all of 1993.
Additionally, stockpiles were at high levels in the United Kingdom, and
two Italian generating stations were closed all year. A UMWA strike,
settled in December 1993, although not widespread at mines served by NS,
idled four operations heavily oriented toward export shipments. In
contrast to the export market, domestic coal remained steady in 1993,
compared with 1992, as extended periods of warmer-than-usual summer
temperatures in the Southeast resulted in increased business for a number
of utility customers. NS also did well in 1993 in the domestic steel
market. While total volumes in this market remained flat, compared with
1992, NS was able to increase its market share.
     MERCHANDISE traffic volume in 1994 increased 8%, and revenues
(excluding, for comparative purposes, the effect of the TCSC partnership;
see page 35) increased by $151.3 million, or 6%, compared with 1993.
Merchandise carloads handled in 1994 were 3.0 million, compared with 2.8
million in 1993. Revenues in all six market groups comprising merchandise
traffic improved over 1993, with four of the six increasing 8% or more.
     CHEMICALS traffic rose 9% over 1993, and revenues increased 8%. A
strong economy strengthened the demand for chemicals, and shipments of
fertilizer and plastics were stronger in 1994 than in recent years. NS is
continuing its expansion of rail-truck bulk distribution facilities to
handle a variety of dry and liquid products. One new Thoroughbred Bulk
Transfer facility opened in 1994, and construction started on five more.
These facilities should play an important part in fostering the growth of
chemicals traffic in 1995 and beyond.
     PAPER/FOREST traffic and revenues were both about even with 1993,
reflecting weak production, severe winter weather and floods in south
Georgia. Some of the weakness in paper was offset by an 8% gain in lumber
traffic, in part due to the opening of five new lumber distribution
centers. These centers facilitate combined rail-truck movements of lumber
and wood products to retail outlets. A resumption of moderate growth is
expected as paper market conditions improve and distribution center
traffic increases.
     AUTOMOTIVE traffic remained steady in 1994, compared with 1993, and
revenues increased to their highest level in NS' history. NS' revenues
from automotive traffic have grown 32% since 1991, although only 1% of
this growth occurred in 1994. Traffic volume in 1994 was adversely
affected by retooling at four plants located on NS' lines. These plants
are scheduled to resume production between early 1995 and mid-1996.
During 1994, NS implemented a number of train coordination projects with
Conrail and Florida East Coast Railway to improve transit times for the
growing network of automotive assembly plants. Over the next few years,
growth in NS' automotive traffic is expected to resume as the plant
retoolings are completed and new plants come on line. Production began at
Toyota's second Georgetown, Ky., plant in March 1994 and at BMW's new
facility in Greer, S.C., in September 1994. Mercedes' plant in Alabama is
expected to come on line in 1997.

          Condition and Results of Operations. (continued)
          -----------------------------------

     AGRICULTURE traffic rose 7%, and revenues increased 9%. Early in the
year, favorable harvest conditions in NS sourcing areas and poor
conditions elsewhere boosted traffic. Later in the year, NS traffic
levels also were very strong, reflecting record corn and soybean harvests
and aggressive programs to increase car utilization through greater use
of 50- and 100-car unit trains. Agriculture has become a growth market
for NS, with revenues increasing 21% during the last five years. This
group is expected to continue to grow as poultry consumption, with the
commensurate rise in demand for feed grain, increases. In 1995, three new
feed mills are expected to open along NS' lines. NS is continuing efforts
to locate new poultry processing facilities along its lines. Growth also
is expected from short-haul movements diverted from truck due to improved
train service.
     METALS/CONSTRUCTION traffic and revenues both rose 9%. Most of the
revenue gain was in shipments of steel, as this industry had its best
year since 1973. Business also increased because of new steel plants and
from aluminum traffic diverted from truck. Late in 1994, NS began sheet-
steel movements to Mexico under a new six-year contract. Construction
markets were strong, with output up 5%. Movements of sand and gravel were
up 13% due to increased highway repair and construction activity. Growth
prospects for metals/construction appear good. Business is expected to
benefit from new steel plants on NS' lines, new municipal solid waste
movements and the increased business to Mexico.
     INTERMODAL traffic rose 13%, and revenues (adjusted for the effect
of the TCSC partnership) increased 14%, compared with 1993. Intermodal is
NS' fastest growing line of business, achieving record levels of volume,
revenue and profitability in 1994. Intermodal growth in 1994 was led by
an increase in trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC) business and, in particular, the
less-than-truckload segment. Notably, these customers, generally major
trucking companies, tend to use their own trailers rather than NS'
trailers. During 1994, these trucking companies switched substantial
amounts of business from highway to rail. This trend is expected to
continue in 1995 and beyond, although at a rate lower than that
experienced in 1994. Containers-on-flatcar (COFC) business also improved
in 1994. The export container segment, NS' largest COFC market, improved
as the economies in Europe recovered and the countries in the
Asia/Pacific region experienced rapid growth in production. Revenues from
domestic COFC movements also improved, as NS increased its market share.
Much of this growth was related to aggressive facility and transit-time
improvements, including expanding or upgrading five terminal facilities.
Current capacity, combined with three planned terminal expansions, will
accommodate an expected growth in COFC and double-stack business.
     During 1993, all six merchandise market groups showed improvement
over 1992. Traffic volume increased 6% and revenues increased $104.6
million, or 5%. The largest revenue increases were in the intermodal
group, up $34.1 million, or 10% (excluding the TCSC effect), the
automotive group, up $28.0 million, or 7%, and metals/construction, up
$19.8 million, or 7%.
     The 1993 growth in intermodal was led by a 21% increase in Triple
Crown(RT) activity due to strong automotive shipments and expansion of
service to the Northeast. COFC revenues were up 6% compared with 1992, a
smaller increase than in previous years due to recessions in Europe and
Japan. TOFC revenues were up 11%, boosted by gains from haulage
arrangements with truckload carriers. The 1993 growth in automotive
traffic was primarily due to strong demand for vehicles produced at
plants served by NS. In addition, NS benefited from a full year of
production at the Ford/Nissan plant located near Avon Lake, Ohio.
Successful marketing efforts, such as the program with GM for just-in-
time movement of auto parts, also contributed to the higher traffic
levels in 1993. The improvement in the metals/construction group in 1993,
compared with 1992, was largely a result of increased iron and steel
shipments related to strong industry production and new plants located on
NS' lines. Shipments of construction commodities also were strong due to
a recovery in housing.

Railway Operating Expenses
--------------------------
     Railway operating expenses in 1994 totaled $2.9 billion, only 2%
higher than 1993, despite a 7% increase in traffic volume. Railway
operating expenses in 1993 were $2.8 billion, a 1% decline compared with
1992, despite a 2% increase in traffic volume.
     The 1994 NS railway operating ratio continued to be the best among
the major railroads in the United States and improved by more than two
full points compared with 1993.


     The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses
summarized by major classifications.


     COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS represents about half of total railway
operating expenses and declined 1% in 1994, compared with 1993, but
increased 1% in 1993, compared with 1992.
     The 1994 decline was principally a result of (1) lower accruals for
stock-based compensation plans as a result of a lower stock price; (2)
reduced accruals for postretirement benefits resulting from a change in
the benefit plan's creditable service period (see Note 11 on page 67);
(3) the expiration of the Railroad Retirement Repayment Tax in June 1993;
(4) the early retirement program in 1993 (see Note 10 on page 65); and
(5) productivity improvements as a result of continuing reductions in
train crew sizes.
     The slightly higher expenses in 1993, compared with 1992, were
mainly due to accruals for postretirement and postemployment benefits
that, prior to 1993, were accounted for on a pay-as-you-go basis (see
"Required Accounting Changes" in Note 1 on page 56) and to higher costs
for stock-based compensation plans. A voluntary early retirement program
was completed in 1993, which resulted in a $42.4 million charge in
compensation and benefits expense (see Note 10 on page 65). Also in 1993,
a $46 million credit was recorded in compensation and benefits,
reflecting a partial reversal of the 1991 special charge (see Note 16 on
page 72).

          -----------------------------------

     MATERIALS, SERVICES AND RENTS consists of items used for maintenance
of road (rail line and related structures) and equipment (locomotives and
freight cars); equipment rents representing the cost to NS of using
freight equipment owned by other railroads or private owners, less the
rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment; and the cost of services
purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating
joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads. This category
increased 2% in 1994, compared with 1993, but declined 6% in 1993,
compared with 1992. The 1994 increase was principally due to higher joint-
facility and leased-road costs and to increased locomotive repair costs,
resulting mostly from higher traffic volume. However, a decrease in usage
by other railroads of NS' facilities also contributed to the increase in
joint facilities expense. The cost of leasing lines of road is expected
to increase in the future as a result of tentative understandings reached
with respect to certain North Carolina leases (see Note 8 on page 64).
Partly offsetting these increases was a decline in equipment rent
expenses resulting from the partial deprescription (deregulation by the
ICC) of car hire rates among railroads. NS expects additional future
benefits as deprescription is fully implemented.
     The decrease in 1993's materials, services and rents, compared with
1992, was largely due to the inclusion in 1992 of certain expenses which,
subsequent to March 31, 1993, were incurred by TCSC (see discussion on
page 35).

depreciation policy) was up 3% in 1994, compared with 1993, and 7% in
1993, compared with 1992. The increases in both periods were due to
property additions, reflecting substantial levels of capital spending
during the three-year period ended December 31, 1994.
     DIESEL FUEL costs increased 5% in 1994, compared with 1993, but
declined 2% in 1993, compared with 1992. The 1994 increase was entirely
due to increased consumption, driven by a 7% increase in carloadings. On
average, 1994's prices were slightly lower than 1993's. NS uses
substantial quantities of diesel fuel; therefore, changes in price or
consumption have a significant impact on the cost of providing
transportation services. Diesel fuel expenses declined in 1993, compared
with 1992, mainly due to a lower price offset partially by increased
consumption.
     CASUALTIES AND OTHER CLAIMS (including insurance costs, estimates of
costs related to personal injury, property damage and environmental
matters) increased 13% in 1994, compared with 1993, but decreased 2% in
1993, compared with 1992. The 1994 increase was primarily attributable to
environmental cleanup costs associated with a tankcar leak (see also
"Environmental Matters" on page 45) and to higher personal injury claim
settlement costs. By far the largest component, personal injury expenses,
which relates primarily to the cost of on-the-job employee injuries, has
shown a favorable trend in the number of incidents since 1990, reflecting
success in reducing accidental employee injuries. Unfortunately, the
favorable trend in the number of accidental injuries has been more than
offset by increased claim costs and higher costs related to non-
accidental "occupational" claims.
     The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to both accidental
injury and occupational claims because of an outmoded law, the Federal
Employers' Liability Act (FELA), originally passed in 1908 and applicable
only to railroads. This law provides the sole basis for compensating
railroad employees who sustain job-related injuries. The system produces
results that are unpredictable, inconsistent and frequently unfair, at a
cost to the rail industry that is two or three times greater than that
under the no-fault workers' compensation systems to which non-rail
competitors are universally subject. The railroads have been unsuccessful
so far in efforts to persuade Congress to replace the FELA with a no-
fault workers' compensation act.
     OTHER expenses increased 12% in 1994, compared with 1993, and
declined 3% in 1993, compared with 1992. The increase over 1993 was due
to favorable property tax settlements in 1993 and to higher relocation
expenses in 1994 related to new job assignments following 1993's early
retirement program. The 1993 decline was largely the result of favorable
settlements of issues related to property and other taxes.

          Condition and Results of Operations. (continued)
          -----------------------------------

Motor Carrier Results
---------------------
     Motor carrier operating income was $22.1 million in 1994, compared
with operating losses of $54.9 million in 1993 and $39.7 million in 1992.
The large loss reported in 1993 was almost entirely attributable to a
restructuring of the business as described below. The continuing
operations, comprising Relocation Services (RS) and High Value Products
(HVP), produced operating income of $22.1 million in 1994 and $14.4
million in 1993, and an operating loss of $9.3 million in 1992.
     A restructuring decision was made in 1993 due to persistently poor
performance in the general commodities operations despite repeated
turnaround efforts. The restructuring led to the liquidation of the
Commercial Transport (CT) Division and the sale of Tran-Star (TS), a
refrigerated carrier. A restructuring charge of $50.3 million was
recorded in 1993 (see Note 15 on page 71).
     The following table presents a three-year comparison of revenues by
principal operations.


     RS' revenues depend on four primary segments of household goods
transportation: corporate national accounts, interstate C.O.D. movements,
military business and international relocations. RS' 1994 revenues
increased 3% over 1993 and were even in 1993, compared with 1992. Volume
gains were achieved in the military and C.O.D. segments; however, prices
were flat. The domestic market-share gains were partly offset by lower
revenues from Canadian operations. Revenues in 1993 were adversely
affected by a decline in domestic military volume and fewer Canadian
shipments. These decreases were partly offset by gains in the
international household relocation segment. The continued downsizing of
U.S. corporations and changes in policy relative to military staffing
levels are likely to result in ongoing pressure on this division's
operating revenues.
     HVP's main line of business is transporting office products and
other sensitive equipment, as well as exhibits and displays. A Customized
Logistic Services (CLS) segment provides integrated logistics expertise.
A Blanketwrap segment that had been part of the discontinued CT Division
provides specialized handling of uncartoned truckload freight. HVP's
revenues increased 29% in 1994, compared with 1993, and 8% in 1993,
compared with 1992. The increase in 1994 was due to (1) the inclusion of
Blanketwrap, which was in HVP for only two months of 1993, and (2) to CLS
which was awarded a significant logistics contract by IBM in third
quarter 1993. The 1993 revenue increase was largely due to the IBM
contract, two months of Blanketwrap revenues and expansion of air freight
services into several new markets. HVP may benefit from a continued
increase in movements of office products and other sensitive commodities,
  PAGE 42

-------   -------------------------------------------------
          Condition and Results of Operations. (continued)
          -----------------------------------

such as medical equipment; however, a trend toward smaller shipment sizes
could subject this operation to increasing competition from other
specialized carriers. Additional growth in the CLS segment is possible as
more shippers look to carriers like NAVL to provide logistics expertise
to reduce overall shipping and handling costs.
     Motor carrier operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were
97%, 108% and 105%, respectively, in 1994, 1993 and 1992. In 1993 and
1992, the highly unfavorable operating ratios were caused largely by
losses sustained in the truckload operations, which more than offset
positive results of RS and HVP. The high operating ratio in 1993 also was
attributable to the restructuring charge and in 1992 to increased
reserves for casualty claims, litigation and workers' compensation.
Operating expenses for 1992 included a $27 million accrual to record
actuarially determined reserve increases for casualty claims and workers'
compensation.
     NAVL's continuing operations generated operating ratios of 97% in
1994 and 1993 and 99% in 1992, excluding the insurance reserve
adjustments. Due to deregulation and overcapacity in the industry, motor
carriers will continue to face vigorous competition that will keep
margins at a modest level.

Other Income-Net
----------------
     Nonoperating income decreased $51.6 million, or 38%, in 1994,
compared with 1993, but increased $39.0 million, or 40%, in 1993,
compared with 1992 (see Note 2 on page 58). These fluctuations
principally arose because of large gains on sales of stock and property
in 1993.

Interest Expense on Debt
------------------------
     Interest expense on debt increased 3% in 1994, compared with 1993,
but declined 10% in 1993, compared with 1992. The 1994 increase was due
to a higher rate of interest on commercial paper debt (see Note 6 on
page 62) and a decrease in the amount of capitalized interest (see Note 5
on page 61). The 1993 decline was due to lower levels of equipment debt
and lower interest rates on commercial paper debt.

Income Taxes
------------
     Income tax expense in 1994 was $381.2 million for an effective rate
of 36.3%, compared with an effective rate of 38.9% in 1993 and 36.3% in
1992. Income tax expense in 1994 and 1993 was accrued under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, rather than under the prior
accounting rules (see "Required Accounting Changes" in Note 1 on
page 56). Absent the federal income tax rate increase imposed by the
Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993, income tax expense in 1993 would have
been $295.8 million for an effective rate of 32.9%.
     The effective rate in 1994 benefited from favorable adjustments
resulting from settlement of the consolidated federal income tax years
1988 and 1989; from an adjustment to the valuation allowance for deferred
tax assets; and from a favorable adjustment upon filing the 1993 tax
return. Deferred tax expense was an unusually high proportion of total
tax expense in 1994. A corresponding reduction is reflected in 1994's
current tax expense for the effects of expenditures that affect book and
tax accounts in different years, primarily in the areas of compensation,
discontinued operations and property.
     The low effective rate of 32.9% in 1993 (excluding the tax rate
increase) was partly due to tax benefits related to the motor carrier
restructuring (see Note 15 on page 71). Current income tax expense in
1993 was a higher proportion of total taxes, primarily because of tax
payments made in anticipation of Revenue Agent Reports for the 1988-1989
federal income tax audit. Deferred tax expense for 1993, compared to
1992, decreased primarily for the same reason (see Note 3 on page 58 for
the components of income tax expense).

-------   -------------------------------------------------
          Condition and Results of Operations. (continued)
          -----------------------------------

Required Accounting Changes
---------------------------
     Effective January 1, 1994, NS adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities" (SFAS 115). SFAS 115 did not have a significant
effect on NS (see also Note 1 on page 56).
     Effective January 1, 1993, NS adopted required accounting for
postretirement benefits other than pensions, postemployment benefits and
income taxes (see Note 1 on page 56 for a discussion of these accounting
changes). The net cumulative effect of these non-cash adjustments
increased 1993's net income by $223.3 million, or $1.60 per share.


FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     FINANCIAL CONDITION refers to the assets, liabilities and
stockholders' equity of an organization (see Consolidated Balance Sheets
on page 52). LIQUIDITY refers to the ability of an organization to
generate adequate amounts of cash, principally from operating results or
through borrowing power, to meet its short-term and long-term cash
requirements (see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 53).
CAPITAL RESOURCES refers to the ability of an organization to raise funds
through the sale of either debt or equity (stock) securities.


     CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, which is NS' principal source
of liquidity, increased $269.7 million, or 31%, in 1994, compared with
1993, but declined $83.6 million, or 9%, in 1993, compared with 1992.
Since the NS consolidation in 1982, cash provided by operating activities
has been sufficient to fund dividend requirements, debt repayments and a
significant portion of capital spending (see Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows on page 53). The improvement in 1994 was primarily a result of
increased income from operations, which was $205 million higher than
1993, and to lower income tax payments. The 1993 decline was largely
attributable to the timing of tax payments, which were $139.9 million
higher than in 1992, due to payments related to the 1988-1989 federal
income tax audit, higher 1993 earnings and the fact that 1992's tax
payments had been low.
     Implementation of the labor portion of the 1991 special charge also
contributed to the fluctuations in cash provided by operations. In 1994,
1993 and 1992, $41.9 million, $36.1 million and $134.7 million,
respectively, were used for labor costs related to the special charge.
The lower payments in 1994 and 1993 were partly due to the failure to
reach agreement on terms for certain further labor savings. This
situation also led to a partial reversal of the 1991 special charge (see
Note 16 on page 72). Looking ahead, the labor portion of the special
charge is expected to require approximately $30 million in each of the 
  PAGE 44

-------   -------------------------------------------------
          Condition and Results of Operations. (continued)
          -----------------------------------

next two years to achieve productivity gains permitted by the agreements. 
NS regards this cash outflow as an investment because, in view of the 
high cost of labor and fringe benefits, these payments produce 
significant future labor savings. In 1994, it is estimated that NS' 
expenses were reduced by $130 million as a result of these programs, 
and upon full implementation of the labor agreements, there will be 
additional savings of about $20 million per year.
     CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES increased 4% in 1994, compared
with 1993, but declined 30% in 1993, compared with 1992. Property
additions account for most of the spending in this category. In 1994,
property additions included $71 million for the acquisition of coal
reserves in West Virginia and Kentucky. Excluding this large property
acquisition, 1994's rail and motor carrier capital expenditures were 4%
below 1993. Efforts to hold down capital spending while increasing
business are ongoing as NS seeks to maximize utilization of its assets.
In this connection, NS continues to review its route network to identify
areas where efficiencies can be achieved by coordinated agreements with
other railroads, or through sales or abandonments. Large borrowings on
corporate-owned life insurance, reflected in "Investment sales and other
transactions" in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (see Note 4 on
page 61), offset much of the use of cash for property additions in 1994.
     In 1993, a combination of higher proceeds from sales of property and
investments and lower capital spending was responsible for the
improvement compared with 1992.



  PAGE 45


Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
-------   -------------------------------------------------
          Condition and Results of Operations. (continued)
          -----------------------------------

     The average age of locomotives retired during 1994 was 23.6 years.
Since 1988, NS has rebodied more than 17,200 coal cars and plans to
continue that program at the rate of about 3,500 cars per year for the
next several years. This work, performed at NS' Roanoke Car Shop,
converts hopper cars into high-capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a
result, the remaining serviceability of the freight car fleet is greater
than indicated by the increasing average age shown above.
     For 1995, NS is planning $695 million of capital spending, of which
$686 million will be for railway projects and $9 million for motor
carrier property. NS anticipates new equipment financing of approximately
$110 million in 1995. Barring unforeseen events, total rail and motor
carrier capital spending is expected to remain in the $600 to $700
million range for the next few years. A substantial portion of future
capital spending is expected to be funded through internally generated
cash, although debt financing will continue as the primary funding source
for equipment acquisitions.
     CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES increased 56% in 1994, compared
with 1993, and 32% in 1993, compared with 1992. The 1994 increase was a
result of increased purchases under the stock purchase program (see Note
13 on page 71). Cash spent since 1987 to purchase and retire stock
totaled $2.5 billion, of which $344.8 million, $138.1 million and $177.2
million was spent in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. During 1994 and
1993, a significant portion of this total spending was from cash
reserves, although purchases in 1994 were funded partially by the
corporate-owned life insurance proceeds. The 1992 stock purchases were
funded largely through issuance of debt. Debt activity over the past five
years was as follows:



     Debt requirements for 1995 are expected to increase related to the
planned acquisition of 125 locomotives and to continuation of the stock
purchase program.

Hedging Activities
------------------
     Certain subsidiaries of NS have entered into hedging transactions
relating to diesel fuel purchases and foreign exchange transactions. The
notional amount of agreements settled from 1992 through 1994 was less
than $2 million, and outstanding agreements at December 31, 1994, were
less than $5 million.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     NS is subject to various jurisdictions' environmental laws and
regulations. It is NS' policy to record a liability where such liability
or loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Claims, if any,
against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are
reflected as receivables in the balance sheet and are not netted against
the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers participate in
ongoing evaluations of all identified sites, and--after consulting with
counsel--any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates are
made. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed
of senior managers, to prescribe and direct its environmental
initiatives.
     Operating expenses for environmental protection totaled
approximately $20 million in 1994 and are anticipated to decrease in
1995. Expenses in 1994 included $10.5 million associated with emergency
response and cleanup resulting from release of arsenic acid from a
tankcar leased by the shipper from a third party. Capital expenditures
for environmental projects amounted to approximately $4 million in 1994
and are expected to be approximately $4 million in 1995. As of December
31, 1994, NS' balance sheet included a reserve for environmental
exposures in the amount of $50 million (of which $13 million is accounted 

  PAGE 46


Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
-------   -------------------------------------------------
          Condition and Results of Operations. (continued)
          -----------------------------------

for as a current liability), which is NS' best estimate of ultimate 
liability at 80 identified locations. On that date, eight sites 
accounted for $23 million of the reserve, and no individual site 
was considered to be material. NS anticipates that the majority of 
this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs 
will be paid out over a longer period.
          At many of the 80 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually
in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as
potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state
statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup
costs.
          With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified
by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS'
ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the
aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the
widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the
likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of
determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and
each potential participant's share of any estimated loss (and that
participant's ability to bear it) and evolving statutory and regulatory
standards governing liability.
          The risk of incurring environmental liability--for acts and
omissions, past, present and future--is inherent in the railroad
business. Some of the commodities, particularly those classified as
hazardous materials, in NS' traffic mix can pose special risks that NS
and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS
subsidiaries have land holdings that serve as operating property, or
which are leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held
for sale. Because certain conditions may exist on these properties
related to environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed, there
can be no assurance that NS will not incur liabilities or costs with
respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which
cannot be estimated reliably now. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving
these and other now-unidentified environmental sites and matters are
likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a
significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
          However, based on its assessments of the facts and
circumstances now known and, after consulting with its legal counsel,
Management believes that it has recorded appropriate estimates of
liability for those environmental matters of which the Corporation is
aware. Further, Management believes that it is unlikely that any
identified matters, either individually or in aggregate, will have a
material adverse effect on NS' financial position, results of operations
or liquidity.

INFLATION

          Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of
historical costs in preparing financial statements. This approach
disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property
and equipment. NS, a capital-intensive company, has approximately
$13 billion invested in such assets. The replacement costs of these
assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be
substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of
historical costs.

          -----------------------------------

INDUSTRY TRENDS

     - Negotiations at the national level on agreements with the major
       labor organizations were under way during 1994, but no new
       agreements have been concluded. The outcome of these negotiations
       is uncertain at this time.

     - The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) may be abolished or its
       role substantially redefined. Whether and to what extent the
       ICC's traditional regulatory functions will be carried out at the
       federal level--and if so, by what agency or agencies--remain
       unclear and are a source of uncertainty.

     - NS and other railroads are continuing to seek opportunities to
       share traffic routes and facilities, furthering the goals of
       providing seamless service to customers and maximizing efficiency
       of the respective railroads.

     - NS and the rail industry are continuing their efforts to replace
       the FELA with no-fault workers' compensation laws comparable to
       those covering employees in other industries.

     - There have been some recent merger and consolidation overtures
       within the railroad industry. NS is closely monitoring this
       activity in light of its own long-term strategic objectives to
       protect the interests of its stockholders.

              NORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
               Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The following notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial
statements.

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation
---------------------------
     The consolidated financial statements include Norfolk Southern
Corporation (Norfolk Southern) and its majority-owned and controlled
subsidiaries (collectively NS). The major subsidiaries are Norfolk
Southern Railway Company and North American Van Lines, Inc. (NAVL). All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.

Cash Equivalents
----------------
     "Cash equivalents" are highly liquid investments purchased three
months or less from maturity.

Investments
-----------
     "Investments" are reported at amortized cost or fair value depending
upon their classification as held-to-maturity, trading or available-for-
sale securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115 (see "Required Accounting
Changes").

Materials and Supplies
----------------------
     "Materials and supplies," consisting mainly of fuel oil and items
for maintenance of property and equipment, are stated at average cost.
The cost of materials and supplies expected to be used in capital
additions or improvements is included in "Properties."

Properties
----------
     "Properties" are stated principally at cost and are depreciated
using group depreciation. Rail is primarily depreciated on the basis of
use measured by gross ton miles. The effect of this method is to write
off these assets over 42 years on average. Other properties are
depreciated generally using the straight-line method over estimated
service lives at annual rates that range from 1% to 25%. In 1994, the
overall depreciation rate averaged 2.7% for roadway and 4.3% for
equipment. NS capitalizes interest on major capital projects during the
period of their construction. Maintenance expense is recognized when
repairs are performed. When properties other than land are sold or
retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost of the assets, net
of sale proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation
rather than recognized through income. Gains and losses on disposal of
land, a nondepreciable asset, are included in other income (see Note 2).

Revenue Recognition
-------------------
     Revenue is recognized proportionally as a shipment moves from origin
to destination.

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Earnings Per Share
------------------
     "Earnings per share" are computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
respective periods. Recent decreases in the number of shares outstanding
are the result of the stock purchase program described in Note 13.

Required Accounting Changes
---------------------------
     1994 - Effective January 1, 1994, NS adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities" (SFAS 115), which addresses the accounting and
reporting for investments in equity securities that have readily
determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities. The
implementation of SFAS 115 had no impact on earnings and resulted in a
$6.3 million increase in stockholders' equity, as of January 1, 1994 (and
a $1.2 million decrease as of December 31, 1994), reflecting unrealized
market changes in certain investments, net of the related deferred taxes.
     1993 - Effective January 1, 1993, NS adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS 106), and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits" (SFAS 112). SFAS 106 requires accrual of the cost of specified
health care and death benefits over an employee's creditable service
period rather than, as was the previously prevailing practice, accounting
for such expenses on a pay-as-you-go basis. SFAS 112 requires recognition
of the cost of benefits payable to former or inactive employees after
employment but before retirement on an accrual basis. For NS, such
postemployment benefits consist principally of benefit obligations under
the long-term disability plan. NS recognized the effects of these changes
in accounting on the immediate recognition basis. The cumulative effect
on years prior to 1993 of adopting SFAS 106 and SFAS 112 increased pretax
expenses $360.2 million ($223.8 million after-tax), and $31.8 million
($19.7 million after-tax), respectively (see also Note 11).
     Also effective January 1, 1993, NS adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109).
SFAS 109 requires a liability approach for measuring deferred tax assets
and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement and
tax bases of assets and liabilities at each balance sheet date using
enacted tax rates in effect when those differences are expected to
reverse. Under SFAS 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. Under the deferred method, which
applied for 1992 and prior years, deferred income taxes were recognized
for income and expense items that were reported in different years for
financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes using the tax rate
applicable for the year of the calculation, and deferred taxes were not
adjusted for subsequent changes in tax rates. The cumulative effect on
years prior to 1993 of adopting SFAS 109 increased net income $466.8
million (see also Note 3).
     The effect on net income and earnings per share of implementing the
accounting changes was to increase net income and earnings per share
$223.3 million and $1.60 per share, respectively.

1993 Federal Income Tax Rate Increase
-------------------------------------
     In August 1993, Congress enacted the Revenue Reconciliation Act of
1993, which increased the federal corporate income tax rate from 34% to
35%, retroactive to January 1, 1993. The tax rate increase had two
components which, as required by SFAS 109, were recognized in 1993's
earnings.
     The first component relates to the increased income tax rate's
effect on 1993's earnings, which increased the provision for income taxes
and reduced net income by $7.9 million, or $0.06 per share. The second
component increased the provision for the net deferred tax liability in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which reduced net income by $46.2
million, or $0.33 per share. Excluding the one-time non-cash charge of
$0.33 per share, 1993's earnings per share before accounting changes
would have been $4.27.

3.   INCOME TAXES (continued)


Deferred Income Tax Expense
---------------------------
     Some income and expense items are reported differently for financial
reporting and income tax purposes. Provisions for deferred income taxes
were made in recognition of these differences in accordance with SFAS 109
for 1994 and 1993 (see Note 1) and with APB Opinion No. 11 for 1992.
     The components of deferred income tax expense for 1992 were as
follows: employee separation costs, $49.7 million; property-related
adjustments, principally depreciation, $45.8 million; casualty and other
claims, $(14.6) million; tax benefit leases, $(7.2) million; employee
benefits, $(5.6) million; and other items-net, $(4.0) million--a total of
$64.1 million.

-------   -------------------------------------------

3.   INCOME TAXES (continued)


     Except for amounts for which a valuation allowance is provided,
Management believes the other deferred tax assets will be realized. The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of January 1, 1993, was
$9.8 million. The net change in the total valuation allowance was a $9.5
million decrease for 1994 and a $1.1 million increase for 1993.

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Reviews
--------------------------------------
     Consolidated federal income tax returns have been examined and
Revenue Agent Reports have been received for all years up to and
including 1989. The consolidated federal income tax returns for 1990
through 1992 are being audited by the IRS. Management believes that
adequate provision has been made for any additional taxes and interest
thereon that might arise as a result of these examinations.

Tax Benefit Leases
------------------
     In January 1995, the United States Tax Court issued a preliminary
decision that would disallow some of the tax benefits an NS subsidiary
purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in
1981. Management continues to believe that NS should realize no loss from
this decision, because the lease agreement provides for full
indemnification if any such disallowance is sustained.

Corporate-Owned Life Insurance
------------------------------
     The planned borrowing of $220 million of cash surrender value on
certain corporate-owned life insurance policies resulted in this amount
being reclassified in the December 31, 1993, Consolidated Balance Sheet
from "Investments" to "Other current assets." The borrowing, which was
completed in May 1994, resulted in the decline in "Other current assets."




Capitalized Interest
--------------------
     Total interest cost incurred on debt for 1994, 1993 and 1992 was
$119.4 million, $120.2 million and $126.9 million, respectively, of which
$17.8 million, $21.6 million and $17.9 million was capitalized.


  PAGE 62


Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (continued)
-------   -------------------------------------------

6.   DEBT

Commercial Paper Program
------------------------
     In 1990, NS established a commercial paper program principally to
finance the purchase and retirement of its common stock (see Note 13). As
of December 31, 1994 and 1993, there were $517.3 million and $521.8
million, respectively, principal amount of notes outstanding under this
program.
     Commercial paper debt is due within one year, but a portion has been
classified as long-term because NS has the ability and intends to
refinance its commercial paper on a long-term basis, either by issuing
additional commercial paper (supported by a revolving credit agreement)
or by replacing commercial paper notes with long-term debt.
     In 1994, NS entered into a new credit agreement effective through
March 29, 1999, which increased the credit limit under its revolving
credit agreement from $400 million to $500 million. Accordingly, the
amount of commercial paper notes classified as "Long-term debt" in the
December 31, 1994, Consolidated Balance Sheet increased to $500 million.
The credit agreement provides for interest on borrowings at prevailing
short-term rates and contains customary financial covenants, including
principally a minimum tangible net worth requirement of $3.3 billion and
a restriction on the creation or assumption of certain liens.



     The "other notes" were assumed in connection with the 1990
acquisition of a coal terminal facility.  The weighted average interest
rate on these notes was 2.6% in 1994 and 2.3% in 1993.

Shelf Registration
------------------
     In 1991, NS filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 covering the issuance of up to
$750 million principal amount of unsecured debt securities. In March
1991, NS issued and sold $250 million principal amount of its 9% notes
due March 1, 2021. In February 1992, NS issued and sold $250 million
principal amount of its 7-7/8% notes due February 15, 2004. These notes
are not redeemable prior to maturity and are not entitled to any sinking
fund. Proceeds from the sale of these notes were used to purchase and
retire shares of NS common stock, to retire short-term commercial paper
debt issued to fund previous share purchases and for general corporate
purposes.

     NS has reached tentative understandings for leases on approximately
300 miles of road in North Carolina. The leases call for payment of an
annual rental of $8 million in 1995, with inflation adjustments in
succeeding years. These estimated payments are included in the future
minimum operating lease commitments above.

10.  PENSION PLANS

     Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries have defined benefit
pension plans that principally cover salaried employees. Pension benefits
are based primarily on years of creditable service with NS and
compensation rates near retirement. Contributions to the plans are made
on the basis of not less than the minimum funding standards set forth in
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. Assets
in the plans consist mainly of common stocks.

Early Retirement Program in 1993
--------------------------------
     During 1993, NS completed a voluntary early retirement program for
salaried employees that resulted in a $42.4 million charge in
"Compensation and benefits" expense. The principal benefit for those who
participated in the program was enhanced pension benefits, which are
reflected in the accumulated benefit obligation.
  PAGE 67


Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (continued)
-------   -------------------------------------------

10.  PENSION PLANS (continued)

Transfer of Pension Plan Assets
-------------------------------
     During 1991, the NS Retirement Plan was amended to establish a
Section 401(h) account for the purpose of transferring a portion of
pension plan assets in excess of the projected actuarial liability to
fund current-year medical payments for retirees. No transfer was made in
1994. Since 1991, $42.5 million has been transferred from the pension
plan to reimburse NS for retirees' medical payments. NS contributed equal
amounts to a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association trust in those
years to fund future medical costs for retirees (see Note 11).

401(k) Plan
-----------
     Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries provide a 401(k) savings
plan for salaried employees. Under the plan, NS matches a portion of the
employee contributions, subject to applicable limitations. NS' expenses
under this plan were $5.1 million, $5.2 million and $4.9 million in 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively.


11.  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

     Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries provide specified health
care and death benefits to eligible retired employees and their
dependents, principally salaried employees. Under the present plans,
which may be amended or terminated at NS' option, a defined percentage of
health care expenses is covered, reduced by any deductibles, co-payments,
Medicare payments and, in some cases, coverage provided by other group
insurance policies. The cost of such health care coverage to a retiree
may be determined, in part, by the retiree's years of creditable service
with NS prior to retirement. Death benefits are determined based on
various factors, including, in some cases, salary at time of retirement.
     NS continues to fund benefit costs principally on a pay-as-you-go
basis. However, in 1991, NS established a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary
Association (VEBA) account to fund a portion of the cost of future health
care benefits for retirees. Although no 401(h) transfer occurred in 1994
(see Note 10), NS made a corporate contribution of $10 million to the
VEBA.
     Effective January 1, 1994, NS amended the attribution period for
postretirement health care benefits. The amendment generally provides for
benefits to be determined ratably over a 10-year period based on
creditable service commencing at age 45, or from date of hire if
employment began after age 45. The amendment reduced the accumulated
postretirement health care benefit obligation by $90 million and 1994's
net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $16 million.

  PAGE 69


Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (continued)
-------   -------------------------------------------

11.  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS (continued)

     For measurement purposes, a 12% annual rate of increase in the per
capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 1994; the
rate in 1995 will be 11.5% and is assumed to decrease gradually to an
ultimate rate of 6% for 2005 and remain at that level thereafter. The
health care cost trend rate has a significant effect on the amounts
reported in the financial statements. To illustrate, increasing the
assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year
would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
December 31, 1994, by about $24 million and the aggregate of the service
and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost
for the year 1994 by about $4.5 million.
     The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, the salary increase
assumption and the long-term rate of return on plan assets are the same
as those used for the pension plans (see table of rate assumptions in
Note 10).
     The VEBA trust holding the plan assets is not expected to be subject
to federal income taxes as the assets are invested entirely in trust-
owned life insurance.
     Under collective bargaining agreements, NS and certain subsidiaries
participate in a multi-employer benefit plan, which provides certain
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible union
employees. Premiums under this plan are expensed as incurred and amounted
to $4.8 million, $5.3 million and $5.6 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.


12.  LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

     Under the stockholder-approved Long-Term Incentive Plan, a
disinterested committee of the Board of Directors may grant stock
options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), and performance share units
(PSUs), up to a maximum 11,675,000 shares of Norfolk Southern common
stock. Grants of SARs and PSUs result in charges to earnings, while
grants of stock options currently have no effect on earnings. Options may
be granted for a term not to exceed 10 years but may not be exercised
prior to the first anniversary date of grant. Options are exercisable at
the fair market value of Norfolk Southern stock on the date of grant.
     SARs were granted on a one-for-one basis in tandem with certain of
the stock option shares. Upon the exercise of an SAR, the optionee
receives in common stock or cash or both (as determined by the committee
administering the plan) the amount by which the fair market value of
common stock on the exercise date exceeds the option price. Exercise of
an SAR or option cancels any related option/SAR. During 1991, the
Securities and Exchange Commission issued new regulations under Section
16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In view of these new
regulations, plan participants surrendered, without cash or other
consideration, all outstanding SARs granted after 1988. Consistent with
the new regulations and the surrender of post-1988 SARs, future grants of
SARs are not anticipated at this time. SARs outstanding as of each year
end were as follows:  74,519 in 1994; 95,852 in 1993; and 133,659 in
1992.

-------   -------------------------------------------

12.  LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (continued)



Performance Share Units
-----------------------
     Performance share units, which were added to this plan by a 1989
amendment, entitle participants to earn shares of common stock at the end
of a three-year performance cycle based upon achievement of certain
predetermined corporate performance goals. PSU grants totaled 163,000 in
1994; 160,500 in 1993; and 196,000 in 1992. Shares earned and issued may
be subject to share retention agreements and held by NS for up to five
years.
     The plan also permits the payment, in cash or in stock, of dividend
equivalents on shares of common stock covered by options and PSUs granted
after January 1, 1989, commensurate with dividends paid on common stock.
Tax absorption payments, in an amount estimated to equal the federal and
state income taxes applicable to shares of common stock issued subject to
a share retention agreement, also are authorized. Dividend equivalents
and tax absorption payments, if made, result in charges to earnings.


  PAGE 71


Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (continued)
-------   -------------------------------------------

13.  STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAMS

     Since 1987, the Board of Directors has authorized the purchase and
retirement of up to 65 million shares of common stock. Purchases under
the programs initially were made with internally generated cash.
Beginning in May 1990, some purchases were financed with proceeds from
the sale of commercial paper notes. In March 1991, $250 million of long-
term notes was issued in part to repay a portion of the commercial paper
notes, as well as to provide funds for additional purchases. An
additional $250 million of long-term notes was issued in February 1992
(see Note 6 for debt details).
     The recent decreases in the average number of outstanding common
shares, as disclosed in the Eleven-Year Financial Review on page 30, are
the results of these purchase programs. Since the first purchases in
December 1987 and through December 31, 1994, NS has purchased and retired
59,160,800 shares of its common stock under these programs at a cost of
$2.5 billion. Future purchases are dependent on market conditions, the
economy, cash needs and alternative investment opportunities.


14.  FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The fair value of "Cash and cash equivalents," "Short-term
investments," "Accounts receivable," "Short-term debt" and "Accounts
payable" approximates carrying value because of the short maturity of
these financial instruments.
     The fair value of long-term "Investments" approximated $261 million
and $217 million at December 31, 1994, and 1993, respectively. Quoted
market prices were used to determine the fair value of marketable
securities which, beginning in 1994 (see Note 1, "Required Accounting
Changes"), were recorded at fair value. Gross unrealized holding losses
on marketable securities were $2.0 million at December 31, 1994.
Underlying net assets were used to estimate the fair value of non-
marketable investments; however, if any such investment was sold after
the end of the year, its sales price determined its fair value for these
purposes. For the remaining investments, consisting principally of
corporate-owned life insurance, the carrying value approximates fair
value (see Note 4 for carrying values of "Investments").
     The fair value of "Long-term debt," including current maturities,
approximated $1.63 billion at December 31, 1994, and $1.74 billion at
December 31, 1993. The fair values of debt were estimated based on quoted
market prices or discounted cash flows using current interest rates for
debt with similar terms, company rating and remaining maturity (see Note
6 for carrying values of "Long-term debt").


15.  MOTOR CARRIER RESTRUCTURING IN 1993

     In mid-1993, NS began a restructuring of its motor carrier
subsidiary by seeking buyers for the truckload freight portion of NAVL,
which consisted of the Commercial Transport Division (CT), a nationwide
truckload carrier, and Tran-Star (TS), a refrigerated carrier. The
restructuring resulted in the liquidation or transfer to other divisions
of most of CT's assets and, in December 1993, the sale of TS' operations.
NAVL's revenues and expenses after June 30, 1993, reflect the results of
its remaining operations.
     In 1993, as a result of these planned dispositions, NS recorded a
$50.3 million pretax ($32.3 million after-tax) charge and recognized an
additional tax benefit of $36.8 million.
     The proceeds from the December 31, 1993, sale of TS' operations are
reflected in "Investment sales and other" in the 1993 Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows. CT's assets remaining at December 31, 1993, were
classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in "Other current assets"
and were disposed of during 1994.

  PAGE 72


Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (continued)
-------   -------------------------------------------

16.  PARTIAL REVERSAL OF SPECIAL CHARGE IN 1993

     Included in 1991 results was a $680 million special charge for labor
force reductions and asset write-downs. However, based on NS' success in
eliminating reserve board positions in 1992 and 1993, and on events
occurring in the third quarter of 1993, the accrual included in the 1991
special charge related to labor was reduced by $46 million and was
reflected as a credit in compensation and benefits expense. The principal
factor contributing to the reversal was the failure in 1993 to reach
agreement on terms for certain further labor savings. Accordingly, it
became apparent that a surplus existed in the labor portion of the
provision established in the 1991 special charge.


17.  CONTINGENCIES

Lawsuits
--------
     Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous
lawsuits relating principally to railroad operations. While the final
outcome of these lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the
opinion of Management, after consulting with its legal counsel, that the
amount of NS' ultimate liability will not materially affect NS'
consolidated financial position.

Debt Guarantees
---------------
     As of December 31, 1994, certain Norfolk Southern subsidiaries are
contingently liable as guarantors with respect to $72.5 million of
indebtedness of related entities.

Change-in-Control Arrangements
------------------------------
     Norfolk Southern has compensation agreements with officers and
certain key employees, which become operative only upon a change in
control of the Corporation, as defined in those agreements. The
agreements provide generally for payments based on compensation at the
time of a covered individual's involuntary or other specified termination
and for certain other benefits.

Environmental Matters
---------------------
     NS is subject to various jurisdictions' environmental laws and
regulations. It is NS' policy to record a liability where such liability
or loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Claims, if any,
against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are
reflected as receivables in the balance sheet and are not netted against
the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers participate in
ongoing evaluations of all identified sites, and--after consulting with
counsel--any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates are
made. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed
of senior managers, to prescribe and direct its environmental
initiatives.
         Operating expenses for environmental protection totaled
approximately $20 million in 1994 and are anticipated to decrease in
1995. Expenses in 1994 included $10.5 million associated with
emergency response and cleanup resulting from release of arsenic acid
from a tank car leased by the shipper from a third party. Capital
expenditures for environmental projects amounted to approximately $4
million in 1994 and are expected to be approximately $4 million in
1995. As of December 31, 1994, NS' balance sheet included a reserve
for environmental exposures in the amount of $50 million (of which $13
million is accounted for as a current liability), which is NS' best
estimate of ultimate liability at 80 identified locations. On that date,
  PAGE 73


Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (continued)
-------   -------------------------------------------

17.  CONTINGENCIES (continued)

eight sites accounted for $23 million of the reserve, and no
individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that the
majority of this liability will be paid out over five years; however,
some costs will be paid out over a longer period.
     At many of the 80 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in
conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as
potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state
statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup
costs.
     With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS
or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS' ultimate
potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all
such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs
of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new
cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature
and full extent of contamination and each potential participant's share
of any estimated loss (and that participant's ability to bear it) and
evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.
     The risk of incurring environmental liability--for acts and
omissions, past, present and future--is inherent in the railroad
business. Some of the commodities, particularly those classified as
hazardous materials, in NS' traffic mix can pose special risks that NS
and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS
subsidiaries have land holdings that serve as operating property, or
which are leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held
for sale. Because certain conditions may exist on these properties
related to environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed, there
can be no assurance that NS will not incur liabilities or costs with
respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which
cannot be estimated reliably now. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving
these and other now-unidentified environmental sites and matters are
likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a
significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
     However, based on its assessments of the facts and circumstances now
known and, after consulting with its legal counsel, Management believes
that it has recorded appropriate estimates of liability for those
environmental matters of which the Corporation is aware. Further,
Management believes that it is unlikely that any identified matters,
either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect
on NS' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

                      INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT





The Stockholders and Board of Directors
Norfolk Southern Corporation:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Norfolk Southern
Corporation and subsidiaries as listed in Item 8. In connection with our
audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
consolidated financial statement schedule listed in Item 14(a)2. These
consolidated financial statements and this consolidated financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and this consolidated financial statement schedule
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Norfolk Southern Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and
1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1994, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related consolidated financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1, the Company changed its methods of accounting in
1993 by adopting the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board's Statement 109, Accounting for Income Taxes; Statement 106,
Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions;
and Statement 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits.
