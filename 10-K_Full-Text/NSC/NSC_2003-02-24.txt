GENERAL

- Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern) was
incorporated on July 23, 1980, under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. On June l, 1982, Norfolk Southern acquired
control of two major operating railroads, Norfolk and Western Railway Company (NW) and Southern Railway Company (Southern) in
accordance with an Agreement of Merger and Reorganization dated as of July 31, 1980, and with the approval of the transaction by
the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) (now the Surface Transportation Board [STB]).

Effective Dec. 31, 1990, Norfolk Southern transferred all the common stock of NW to Southern, and Southern's
name was changed to Norfolk Southern Railway Company (Norfolk Southern Railway). Effective Sept. 1, 1998, NW was merged with
and into Norfolk Southern Railway. As of Dec. 31, 2002, all the common stock of Norfolk Southern Railway and 22.5% of its
voting preferred stock (resulting in 95.2% voting control) was owned directly by Norfolk Southern.

Through a jointly owned entity, Norfolk Southern and CSX Corporation (CSX) own the stock of Conrail Inc.,
which owns the major freight railroad in the Northeast. Norfolk Southern has a 58% economic and 50% voting interest in the jointly
owned entity. See also the discussion concerning operation of a portion of Conrail's rail assets, below.

On March 28, 1998, Norfolk Southern closed the sale of its motor carrier company, North American Van Lines,
Inc. (NAVL) (see "Discontinued Operations" and Note 17). NAVL's results are presented as "Discontinued operations" in the
accompanying financial information.

Norfolk Southern makes available free of charge through its website, www.nscorp.com, its annual report on Form
10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably
practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Unless indicated otherwise, Norfolk Southern and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as NS.

OPERATION OF A PORTION OF THE CONRAIL RAIL ASSETS

- On
June 1, 1999, Norfolk Southern and CSX, through their respective railroad subsidiaries, began operating separate portions of
Conrail's rail routes and assets. Substantially all such assets are owned by two wholly owned subsidiaries of Consolidated Rail
Corporation (CRC); one of those subsidiaries, Pennsylvania Lines LLC (PRR), has entered into various operating and leasing
arrangements, more particularly described in Note 2, with Norfolk Southern Railway. Certain rail assets (Shared Assets Areas)
still are owned by CRC, which operates them for joint and exclusive use by Norfolk Southern Railway and the rail subsidiary of
CSX.

Operation of the PRR routes and assets increased the size of the system over which Norfolk Southern Railway
provides service by nearly 50% and afforded access to the New York metropolitan area, to

much of the Northeast and to most of the major East Coast ports north of Norfolk, Virginia. Also, leasing
arrangements with PRR augmented Norfolk Southern Railway's locomotive, freight car and intermodal fleet.

RAILROAD OPERATIONS

- As of
Dec. 31, 2002, NS' railroads operated approximately 21,500 miles of road in the states of Alabama, Delaware, Florida,
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, the District of Columbia and in the Province of
Ontario, Canada. The miles operated were as follows:

K3

In addition to the lines leased from Conrail previously discussed, NS' railroads have major leased lines between
Cincinnati, Ohio, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, and operate over trackage owned by North Carolina Railway Company (NCRR). The
Cincinnati-Chattanooga lease, covering about 335 miles of road, expires in 2026, and is subject to an option to extend the lease
for an additional 25 years, at terms to be agreed upon. The trackage rights over NCRR cover approximately 315 miles of road under
an agreement through 2014 with the right to renew for two additional 15-year periods.

NS' railroads carry raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods primarily in the Southeast, East and
Midwest, and via interchange with other rail carriers, to and from the rest of the United States and parts of Canada. They also
transport overseas freight through several Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports. Atlantic ports served by NS include: Norfolk, Virginia;
Morehead City, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah and Brunswick, Georgia; Jacksonville, Florida; Baltimore,
Maryland; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania/Camden, New Jersey; Wilmington, Delaware; and the Ports of New York/New Jersey. Gulf Coast
ports served include Mobile, Alabama, and New Orleans, Louisiana.

The lines of NS' railroads reach most of the larger industrial and trading centers of the Southeast, Northeast,
Mid-Atlantic region and Midwest. Chicago, Norfolk, Detroit, Atlanta, Metropolitan New York City, Jacksonville, Kansas City
(Missouri), Baltimore, Buffalo, Charleston, Cleveland, Columbus, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Toledo, Greensboro, Charlotte and
Savannah are among the leading centers originating and terminating freight traffic on the system. In addition, haulage arrangements
with connecting carriers allow NS' railroads to provide single-line service to and from additional markets, including haulage
provided by Florida East Coast Railway Company to serve southern and eastern Florida, including the port cities of Miami, West Palm
Beach and Fort Lauderdale; and haulage provided by The Kansas City Southern Railway Company to provide transcontinental intermodal
service via a connection with the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company. Service is provided to New England, including
the Port of Boston, via haulage, trackage rights and interline arrangements with Canadian Pacific Railway Company and Guilford
Transportation Industries. The system's lines also reach many individual industries, electric generating facilities, mines (in
western Virginia, eastern Kentucky, southern and northern West Virginia and western Pennsylvania), distribution centers, transload
facilities and other businesses located in smaller communities in its service area. The traffic corridors carrying the heaviest
volumes of freight include those from the New York City area to Chicago (via Allentown and Pittsburgh); Chicago to Jacksonville
(via Cincinnati, Chattanooga and Atlanta); Appalachian coal fields of Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, to Norfolk and
Sandusky, Ohio; Cleveland to Kansas City; and Knoxville to Chattanooga. Chicago, Memphis, Sidney/Salem, New Orleans, Kansas City,
Buffalo, St. Louis and Meridian are major gateways for interterritorial system traffic.

Triple Crown Operations

- Until April 1993, NS' intermodal
subsidiary, Triple Crown Services, Inc. (TCS), offered intermodal service using RoadRailer® equipment and domestic containers.
RoadRailer® units are enclosed vans that can be pulled over highways in tractor-trailer configuration and over the rails by
locomotives. On April 1, 1993, the business, name and operations of TCS were transferred to Triple Crown Services Company
(TCSC), a partnership in which subsidiaries of NS and Conrail are equal partners. From April 1, 1993, to June 1, 1999, the
revenues of TCSC were not consolidated with the results of NS; however, effective June 1, 1999, NS gained control of TCSC and,
therefore, now includes TCSC's results in its

K4

consolidated financial statements. TCSC offers door-to-door intermodal service using RoadRailer® equipment in
major traffic corridors, including those between the Midwest and the Northeast, the Midwest and the Southeast and the Midwest and
Texas/Mexico.

The following table sets forth certain statistics relating to NS railroads' operations for the past 5 years,
including operations in the Northern Region that commenced June 1, 1999:

RAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES

- NS' total railway operating
revenues were $6.3 billion in 2002. Revenue, shipments and revenue yield by principal railway operating revenue sources for
the past five years are set forth in the following table.

K5

COAL TRAFFIC

- Coal, coke and iron ore -- most of which is bituminous
coal -- is NS' railroads' largest commodity group as measured by revenues. The railroads handled a total of 170.4 million
tons in 2002, most of which originated on NS' lines in West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Kentucky. Revenues from coal, coke
and iron ore accounted for about 23% of NS' total railway operating revenues in 2002.

Coal, coke and iron ore tonnage by market for the past five years are set forth in the following table.

K6

Total coal handled through all system ports in 2002 was 32 million tons. Of this total, 10 million tons
(including coastwise traffic) moved through Lamberts Point, Virginia, 3 million tons moved through the Baltimore Terminal, 11
million tons moved to various docks on the Ohio River, and 8 million tons moved to various Lake Erie ports. Other than coal
for export, virtually all coal handled by NS' railroads was terminated in states east of the Mississippi River.

See the discussion of coal traffic, by type of coal, in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and
Analysis."

GENERAL Merchandise Traffic

- General merchandise
traffic is composed of five major commodity groupings:  automotive; chemicals; metals and construction; agriculture,
consumer products and government; and paper, clay and forest products. The automotive group includes finished vehicles for BMW,
Daimler Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Isuzu, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan,
Saab, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota and Volkswagen, and auto parts for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota. The
chemicals group includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber,
industrial chemicals, chemical wastes and municipal wastes. The metals and construction

group includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, bricks and minerals. The
agriculture, consumer products and government group includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer, animal and poultry feed, food oils,
flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products and items for the military. The paper, clay and forest products group
includes lumber and wood products, pulpboard and paper products, woodfibers, woodpulp, scrap paper and clay. General merchandise
carloads handled in 2002 were 2.76 million, compared with 2.72 million handled in 2001, an increase of 2%.

In 2002, 134 million tons of general merchandise freight, or approximately 67% of total general merchandise
tonnage handled by NS, originated online. The balance of general merchandise traffic was received from connecting carriers at
interterritorial gateways. The principal interchange points for NS-received traffic included Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans,
Cincinnati, Kansas City, Detroit, Hagerstown, St. Louis/East St. Louis and Louisville.

See the discussion of general merchandise rail traffic by commodity group in Part II, Item 7,
"Management's Discussion and Analysis."

INTERMODAL TRAFFIC

- The intermodal market consists of shipments moving in
trailers, domestic and international containers, and Roadrailer® equipment. These shipments are handled on behalf

of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers and other shippers. Intermodal units
handled in 2002 were 2.35 million, compared with 2.21 million handled in 2001,

an increase of 6%.

See the discussion of intermodal traffic in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis."

K7

FREIGHT RATES

- In 2002, NS' railroads continued their reliance
on private contracts and exempt price quotes as their predominant pricing mechanisms. Thus, a major portion of NS' railroads'
freight business is not currently economically regulated by the government. In general, market forces have been substituted for
government regulation and now are the primary determinant of rail service prices. However, in 2002 there were significant coal
movements moving under common carrier (tariff) rates which had previously moved under rates contained in transportation contracts.
Beginning Jan. 1, 2002, coal moving to Duke Energy's (Duke) Belew's Creek, Allen, Buck and Dan River generating stations moved
under common carrier rates and beginning April 1, 2002, coal moving to Carolina Power and Light's (CP&L) Hyco and Mayo plants
moved under common carrier rates. Duke and CP&L have challenged the reasonableness of these common carrier rates in proceedings
currently pending before the Surface Transportation Board.

In 2002, NS' railroads were found by the STB not to be "revenue adequate" based on results for the year 2001. A
railroad is "revenue adequate" under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry's composite
cost of capital. This determination is made pursuant to statutory requirement and does not adversely impact NS' liquidity or
capital resources.

PASSENGER OPERATIONS

- Regularly scheduled passenger trains are
operated by Amtrak on NS' lines between Alexandria and New Orleans, and between Greensboro and Selma, North Carolina. Commuter
trains are operated on the NS line between Manassas and Alexandria in accordance with contracts with two transportation commissions
of the Commonwealth of Virginia. NS also leases the Chicago to Manhattan, Illinois, line to the Commuter Rail Division of the
Regional Transportation Authority of Northeast Illinois. Since June 1, 1999, Norfolk Southern Railway has operated former
Conrail lines on which Amtrak conducts regularly scheduled passenger operations between Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan,
and between Chicago and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Also since June 1, 1999, through its operation of PRR's routes, Norfolk Southern Railway has been providing freight
service over former Conrail lines with significant ongoing Amtrak and commuter passenger operations, and is conducting freight
operations over some trackage owned by Amtrak or by New Jersey Transit, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority,
Metro-North Commuter Railway Company and Maryland DOT. Finally, passenger operations are conducted either by Amtrak or by the
commuter agencies over trackage owned by Pennsylvania Lines LLC, or by Conrail in the Shared Assets Areas.

NONCARRIER OPERATIONS

- NS' noncarrier subsidiaries engage
principally in the acquisition, leasing and management of coal, oil, gas and minerals; the development of commercial real estate;
telecommunications; and the leasing or sale of rail property and equipment. In 2002, no such noncarrier subsidiary or industry
segment grouping of noncarrier subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment set forth in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 131.

RAILWAY PROPERTY

The NS railroad system extends across 22 states and portions of Canada. The railroad infrastructure makes the
company very capital intensive with total property of approximately $11 billion and investment in Conrail of approximately $6
billion.

K8

Capital Expenditures

- Capital expenditures for
road, equipment and other property for the past five years were as follows (including capitalized leases):

Capital spending and maintenance programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe,
efficient and reliable transportation services. For 2003, NS has budgeted $798 million of capital spending. See the discussion
following "Cash used for investing activities," in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis."

Equipment

- As of
Dec. 31, 2002, NS owned or leased the following units of equipment:

K9

The following table indicates the number and year built for locomotives and freight cars owned at Dec. 31,
2002.

As of Dec. 31, 2002, the average age of the locomotive fleet was 16.1 years. During 2002, 52 locomotives,
the average age of which was 28.2 years, were retired. The average age of the freight car fleet at Dec. 31, 2002, was
25.9 years. During 2002, 3,013 freight cars were retired.

Since 1988, about 29,000 coal cars have been rebodied. As a result, the remaining serviceability of the
freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the high percentage of freight cars built in earlier years.

Ongoing freight car and locomotive maintenance programs are intended to ensure the highest standards of safety,
reliability, customer satisfaction and equipment marketability. In past years, the freight car bad order ratio reflected the
storage of certain types of cars that were not in high demand. The ratio rose in 2000, 2001 and 2002 as a result of decreased
maintenance activity. A review began in 2002 to address several hundred unserviceable, overage and commercially obsolete freight
cars, which will likely result in their disposition in 2003. The locomotive bad order ratio includes units out of service for
required inspections every 92 days and program work such as overhauls. The increase in the locomotive bad order ratio in 1999 was
primarily due to the maintenance requirements of units being rented to meet short-term needs and to weather-related failures. The
ratio rose slightly in 2000 as maintenance activities were curtailed in response to a slowing economy. The elevated ratio through
2001 and 2002 reflected units out of service related to the resumption of maintenance and modification activities.

Track Maintenance

- Of the approximately 38,500
total miles of track operated, NS had responsibility for maintaining about 31,000 miles of track with the remainder being operated
under trackage rights. Over 75% of the main line trackage (including first, second, third and branch main tracks, all excluding
trackage rights) has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 141 pounds per yard.
Approximately 40% of NS lines carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile.

K10

The following table summarizes several measurements regarding NS' track
roadway additions and replacements during the past five years:

Microwave System

- The NS microwave
system, consisting of approximately 7,282 radio route miles, 442 active stations and 4 passive repeater stations,
provides communications between most operating locations. The microwave system is used primarily for voice communications, VHF
radio control circuits, data and facsimile transmissions, traffic control operations and AEI data transmissions.

Traffic Control

- Of a total of 21,500 route
miles operated by NS, excluding trackage rights over foreign lines, 11,511 miles are signalized, including 8,546 miles of
centralized traffic control (CTC) and 2,965 miles of automatic block signals. Of the 8,546 miles of CTC, 1,895 miles are controlled
by data radio originating at 148 base station radio sites.

Computers

- A computer network
consisting of a centralized data center in Atlanta, Georgia, and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the
yards, terminals, transportation offices, rolling stock repair points, sales offices and other key system locations. Operating and
traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the system. Computer
systems provide current information on the location of every train and each car on line, as well as related waybill and other train
and car movement data. In addition, the computer systems are utilized to assist management in the performance of a variety of
functions and services including payroll, car and revenue accounting, billing, material management activities and controls, and
special studies.

Other

- The railroads have extensive facilities
for support of operations, including freight depots, car construction shops, maintenance shops, office buildings, and signals and
communications facilities.

Encumbrances

- Certain railroad equipment is
subject to the prior lien of equipment financing obligations amounting to approximately $864 million as of Dec. 31, 2002, and
$895 million at Dec. 31, 2001.

Environmental Matters

-
Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is a principal NS goal.
To date, such compliance has not affected materially NS' capital additions, earnings, liquidity or competitive position. See the
discussion of "Environmental Matters" in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis," and in Note 18 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

EMPLOYEES

- NS employed an average of
28,970 employees in 2002, compared with an average of 30,894 in 2001. The decrease reflects NS' continuous drive to operate more
efficiently, accompanied by railroad retirement legislation late in 2001, which lowered the retirement age for rail employees. The
approximate average cost per employee during 2002 was $54,000 in wages and $24,000 in employee benefits.

Approximately 85% of NS' railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions.
See the discussion of "Labor Agreements" in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis."

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

- In addition
to environmental, safety, securities and other regulations generally applicable to all businesses, NS' railroads are subject to
regulation by the STB, which succeeded the ICC on Jan. 1, 1996. The STB has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, conditions
of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines. The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger or
acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers. The Department of Transportation regulates certain track and mechanical
equipment standards.

The relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, begun over two decades ago by the ICC under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, has
continued under the STB. Significant exemptions are TOFC/COFC (i.e., "piggyback")

K11

business, rail boxcar traffic, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand,
gravel, pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing. Transportation contracts on regulated shipments effectively remove those
shipments from regulation as well. About 80% of NS' freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under
transportation contracts.

Efforts may be made in 2003 to re-subject the rail industry to unwarranted federal economic regulation. The Staggers Rail
Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for
business, thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry. Accordingly, NS will
oppose efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation.

COMPETITION

- There is continuing
strong competition among rail, water and highway carriers. Price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers
choose a transport mode and specific hauling company. Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling and the
desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods,
machinery and consumer products. Even for raw materials, semifinished goods and work-in-process, users are increasingly sensitive
to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.

NS'
primary rail competitor is the CSX system; both operate throughout much of the same territory. Other railroads also operate in
parts of the territory. NS also competes with motor carriers, water carriers and with shippers who have the additional option of
handling their own goods in private carriage.

Certain marketing strategies between railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable carriers to compete more
effectively in specific markets.

NORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and
Notes and the Five-Year Financial Review.

SUMMARIZED
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2002 Compared with 2001

Net income was $460 million in 2002, up $85 million, or 23%. Results in 2001 included a $13 million gain from
discontinued operations related to the 1998 sale of NS' former motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17). Excluding that gain from
2001's results, net income was up $98 million, or 27%, in 2002. The improvement was primarily the result of a $151 million, or 15%,
increase in income from railway operations.

Diluted earnings per share were $1.18, up 22%. Excluding the discontinued operations gain, diluted earnings per
share increased 26%.

2001 Compared with 2000

Net income in 2001 was $375 million, up 118%. Income from continuing operations, which excludes the $13 million
discontinued operations gain, was $362 million, up 110%. Results in 2000 included $165 million of costs related to actions taken to
reduce the size of the work force, which reduced income from continuing operations by $101 million, or 26 cents per diluted share.
Excluding these costs, income from continuing operations increased $89 million, or 33%, in 2001. The improvement resulted from
higher income from railway operations, which was up $209 million, or 26%, that more than offset lower nonoperating income, which
was down $69 million (see Note 3).

Diluted earnings per share were 97 cents, up 116%. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 94
cents, up 109%. Excluding the work-force reduction costs in 2000, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up
32%.

DETAILED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Railway Operating Revenues

Railway operating revenues were $6.3 billion in 2002, and $6.2 billion in both 2001 and 2000. The following table
presents a three-year comparison of revenues by market group.

K16

In 2002, revenues increased 2%, as a 3% rise in general merchandise revenues coupled with a 5% improvement in
intermodal revenues offset a 5% decline in coal revenues. All but one of the general merchandise market groups (paper, clay and
forest products) posted increases over 2001. As shown in the following table, most of the revenue improvement was the result of
higher traffic volumes. The favorable revenue per unit/mix variance was driven by higher average revenue per unit, offset in part
by the effects of unfavorable changes in the mix of traffic.

In 2001, revenues fell for all the general merchandise market groups. However, a 6% increase in coal revenues
offset the effects of the lower general merchandise revenues. Revenue per unit increased in all market groups, principally due to
rate increases, use of higher-capacity equipment and favorable changes in the mix of traffic.

COAL

tonnage decreased 4% in 2002 and revenues declined 5%. Revenue per
unit declined slightly, reflecting unfavorable changes in the mix of traffic (more shorter-haul business) that offset the effects
of rate increases and gains in tonnage per car. Coal, coke and iron ore represented 23% of total railway operating revenues in
2002, and 84% of NS' coal shipments originated on lines it operates.

In 2001, coal tonnage increased 2%, and revenues improved 6%. Revenue per unit increased 6%, a result of rate
increases, including lower volume-related refunds on export coal shipments, gains in tonnage per car and favorable changes in the
mix of traffic (less shorter-haul business).

K17

Utility coal

tonnage decreased 3% in 2002, a result of lower demand that
reflected the weak economy, high coal stockpile levels entering the year, mild temperatures in the first quarter, reduced stockpile
targets set by utility companies and increased generation from new natural gas-fired plants. Licensing requirements for these new
plants resulted in additional generation that temporarily displaced coal-fired generation.

In 2001, utility coal traffic increased 11%, reflecting higher demand for coal-fired electricity and the effects of
very high natural gas prices early in the year. High demand for coal, a volatile market for natural gas and production problems at
a number of large mines in the East late in 2000 combined to increase demand somewhat early in 2001 with a resulting increase in
coal prices. Utility coal traffic volume also benefited somewhat from the shifting of coal that traditionally would have been bound
for export to the domestic market.

Two of NS' utility customers, Duke Energy (Duke) and Carolina Power and Light (CP&L), have filed rate
reasonableness complaints at the Surface Transportation Board (STB) alleging that the NS tariff rates for the transportation of
coal to their solely served power plants are unreasonable. NS is disputing these allegations. Since January 1, 2002, in the case of
Duke and since April 1, 2002, in the case of CP&L, NS has been billing and collecting amounts from the customers based on the
challenged tariff rates. Management expects that the resolution of these cases, which is anticipated to occur in 2003, will not
have a material effect on NS' financial statements.

The near-term outlook for utility coal remains positive. Coal-fired generation remains the lowest cost marginal
source of electricity. Coal plant generation should continue to track the U.S. economy, and management expects that utilities will
use coal-fired plants to meet increased demand because of coal's low cost. As always, demand will be influenced by the weather. In
addition, while the price of natural gas can affect demand for utility coal, its higher price and volatility may improve the
long-term competitive position of coal-fired generation.

Phase II of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which imposed more stringent limits on sulfur dioxide
emissions, took effect on Jan. 1, 2000. Many of the mines served by NS produce coals that satisfy Phase II requirements. In
addition, substantial banks of sulfur dioxide allowances held by many NS-served utilities, as well as implementation of sulfur
dioxide emission control systems at many NS-served plants, should continue to provide a market for other NS-served mines.

While the Phase II impact on NS utility coal has been minimal, there are a number of other evolving environmental
issues that have the potential to increase or ease cost pressures on the utility coal market, depending upon their outcome. These
include a potential new national energy policy, proposed multi-pollutant legislation, a proposed new rule concerning "new source
review," the impending mercury emissions standard and the fate of U.S. participation in the Kyoto Protocol.

K18

Although impending developments with these environmental issues could potentially increase cost pressures on
coal-fired generation, the outlook remains positive for maintaining coal's position in the power generation mix for regions served
by NS. However, different developments with these issues could actually ease cost pressures on coal-fired generation, further
strengthening coal's position.

The 1999 decision by a federal district court judge in West Virginia holding that some common mountaintop mining
practices in the coal industry are illegal was overturned in April 2001 by the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In January
2002, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of the case. In May 2002, the same district court judge made a similar
ruling in a different case in which NS had again intervened. In January 2003, this ruling also was overturned by the Fourth Circuit
Court of Appeals.

Export coal

tonnage declined 18% in 2002. Steam coal exports through
Baltimore declined 4%, and export metallurgical coals through Norfolk declined 22%. During the first half of 2002, demand for U.S.
coal was soft as international buyers focused their purchases toward other, lower-priced sources. Market uncertainty resulted in
late contract settlements and delayed shipments. Late in 2002, demand for U.S. coking coals increased, reflecting a shift in the
market as exports from China, Australia and Poland declined. As a result, shipments through Norfolk increased in the fourth
quarter.

In 2001, export coal tonnage decreased 30%. The rapid rise of domestic utility coal prices early in the year
enticed many foreign-market suppliers to place much of their 2001 production in the domestic utility markets. In addition,
production difficulties at several large NS-served mines and flooding in West Virginia in July significantly reduced the supply of
low volatility coal. The combination of these factors resulted in most of the decline in shipments of export coal. Steam coal
exports through Baltimore declined 32%, and export metallurgical coals through Norfolk declined by 30%. Demand for steam coal to
export strengthened in the last half of 2001; however, strong U.S. demand limited NS' participation in this market. Demand for
coking coal to export continued to soften, as steel production moved from traditional NS markets in Europe to Asia, which in recent
years has been supplied by Australian or Canadian coals.

It is expected that export coal tonnage will continue to be limited by supply and subject to the fluctuations of
the world market. The increase in demand for U.S. coals seen in the fourth quarter of 2002 has continued into the first quarter of
2003, and early indications are that these market forces should remain in place as contracts are settled in the spring for the
coming year. Should these market forces continue, U.S. coal export volumes could recover somewhat. However, the inherent volatility
and uncertainties in this market make predictions especially vulnerable.

Domestic metallurgical

coal, coke and iron ore tonnage increased 5% in
2002, reflecting higher U.S. steel production that was aided by the imported steel tariff program implemented in 2002. In addition,
continued strong vehicle production resulted in demand for steel.

In 2001, domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore tonnage decreased 18% due to a decline in the market for
domestic steel. The softening economy and an increase in steel imports drastically cut blast furnace production, sharply reducing
the demand for coking coal, iron ore and coke. The increase in imported steel also resulted in lower prices that put pressure on
the U.S. steel industry and led to plant closures and bankruptcies that included some NS customers.

Domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic is expected to continue to experience modest gains during
the two-year life of the import tariffs. However, long-term demand is expected to decline, reflecting advanced technologies that
allow production of steel using less coke.

K19

Other coal

tonnage, principally steam coal shipped to manufacturing
plants, decreased 14% in 2002, but increased 6% in 2001. The decline in 2002 was primarily the result of the weak economy. The gain
in 2001 resulted from new and increased business from industrial customers.

GENERAL MERCHANDISE

traffic volume (carloads) increased 2% in 2002, and
revenues increased 3%, principally due to a 9% improvement in automotive revenues. In 2001, traffic volume decreased 7%, and
revenues decreased 2%, reflecting the effects of a weak economy.

Automotive

traffic volume increased 7%, and revenues increased 9% in 2002,
principally due to a rise in vehicle production and new business. Revenue per unit increased 2%, reflecting some pricing
improvements, extended length of haul, special ancillary services and the settlement of a disputed charge.

In 2001, automotive traffic volume decreased 10%, and revenues declined 4%, principally due to a 10% drop in
vehicle production. Revenue per unit increased 7%, principally due to rate increases, efficiencies gained from the redesign of the
mixing center network and use of higher capacity equipment.

Automotive revenues in 2003 are expected to be lower than those of 2002. Light vehicle production is predicted to
be down slightly, and NS' largest automotive customer has announced a 5% decrease in first quarter 2003 production.

Chemicals

traffic volume increased slightly, and revenues increased 2% in
2002. Higher traffic volume for plastics and a small increase for miscellaneous chemicals offset a decline for petroleum products.
Demand for plastics was supported by increases in light vehicle production and housing starts. Traffic volume also benefited from
increased shipments through NS' Thoroughbred Bulk Transfer (TBT) facilities that handle chemicals and bulk commodities for
customers not located on NS-served lines. Revenue per unit increased as a result of a favorable change in the mix of traffic (more
higher-rated business) and market-driven rate increases.

In 2001, chemicals traffic volume decreased 5%, and revenues decreased 1%. The weak economy depressed shipments of
petroleum, plastics, industrial and miscellaneous chemicals. These declines were partially offset by new business through NS' TBT
facilities. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and a favorable change in the mix of traffic (more longer-haul
moves).

Chemicals revenues are expected to improve in 2003, supported by a recovering economy, new business and improved
revenue per unit.

Metals and construction

traffic volume increased 2%, and revenues improved
3% in 2002, reflecting improvement in the steel industry, which was aided by the two-year imported steel tariff program implemented
in 2002. Metals volume benefited from resumption of production at some mills that closed in 2001 and increased volume from new
mills. Construction traffic declined, primarily as a result of reductions in highway projects due to state government budget
pressures.

In 2001, metals and construction traffic volume decreased 7%, and revenues declined 2%, reflecting weakness in the
steel and construction industries. The steel industry recession, which began in 2000, resulted in excess capacity and the closing
of numerous steel mills. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic.

Metals and construction revenues are expected to continue to benefit from added production along NS' lines,
although further consolidation in the steel industry is expected. Construction markets may benefit from new business from stone
quarries and cement terminals in the Southeast.

Agriculture, consumer products and government

traffic volume decreased slightly in 2002, but revenues increased 3%.
Traffic volume increases for corn, food products and beverages largely offset declines for soybeans and feed. Corn volume benefited
from increased shipments from the Midwest to

K20

drought-stricken areas in the East. The increase for food products was primarily the result of new business.
Soybean and feed volumes were adversely affected by lower domestic and export demand. Revenue per unit increased because of higher
rates, increased length of haul and favorable changes in the mix of traffic.

In 2001, agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume decreased 3%, and revenues declined 1%,
primarily due to reduced shipments of fertilizer. This decline was due to soft farm demand, record high natural gas prices early in
the year (which curtailed production of certain fertilizers) and increased imports. This was mitigated by traffic volume increases
for grain, flour and canned goods. The revenue per unit increase was primarily due to favorable changes in the mix of traffic.

Agriculture, consumer products and government revenues in 2003 are expected to continue to benefit from higher
corn, fertilizer and food product volume. Fertilizer volumes may be favorably affected by the reopening of a large phosphate
fertilizer plant.

Paper, clay and forest products

traffic volume declined 3%, and revenues
decreased 1%, in 2002, primarily due to continued weakness in the paper market, especially in the first half of the year. Traffic
volume improved later in the year as the paper market strengthened. In addition, NS gained business from conversion of truck
shipments to rail and from continued strength in housing starts. Revenue per unit benefited from rate increases and a decline in
shorter-haul business.

In 2001, paper, clay and forest products traffic volume declined 8%, and revenues decreased 3%, primarily due to a
weakened paper market. Paper shipments were adversely affected by reduced production at many NS-served paper mills, a result of
sluggish newspaper advertising and soft demand for paper. Lumber traffic began the year weak, improved in late summer, but softened
late in the year due to short-term weakness in housing starts. Revenue per unit increased principally due to higher rates.

Paper, clay and forest products revenues are expected to improve slightly in 2003 as a result of a recovering
economy, service improvements and new business.

INTERMODAL

traffic volume increased 6%, and revenues increased 5%, in
2002. Volume growth was principally the result of new and improved services that resulted in new business, including the conversion
of truck business to rail. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, increased 10%, supported by
growth in trade activity and new business, including the conversion of over-the-road traffic. Domestic shipments grew 6%, primarily
because of new business gained from the conversion of truck shipments. Triple Crown Services Company (TCS) volume increased 4%.
Revenue per unit declined as a result of an increase in shorter-haul business and the absence of fuel surcharges that were in place
in 2001, which were partially offset by some rate increases.

In 2001, intermodal traffic volume decreased 1%, but revenues increased slightly. Domestic traffic volume was up in
the first half of the year, but demand increasingly weakened as the year progressed, which eroded NS' base of traffic. New business
supported by the opening of three new terminals and other initiatives mitigated the effects of the weakened economy. International
traffic grew slightly as U.S. imports slowed with the economy. TCS traffic volume increased 1% despite economic conditions, as it
continued to provide reliable, trucklike service. Intermodal revenue per unit dropped later in the year, reflecting the expiration
of fuel surcharges that were implemented late in 2000 and the introduction of new shorter-haul business.

In 2003, intermodal revenues are expected to continue to benefit from new business supported by continued
improvements in service and conversion of truck traffic to rail.

K21

Railway Operating Expenses

Railway operating expenses decreased 1% in 2002, while carloads increased 1%. In 2001, railway operating expenses
declined 7%. However, expenses in 2000 included $165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work
force. Excluding these costs, railway operating expenses decreased 4% in 2001, while carloads dropped 3%.

The railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway
operating expenses, was 81.5% in 2002, compared with 83.7% in 2001 and 87% in 2000 (excluding the work-force reduction costs, which
increased the ratio 2.7 percentage points). Both declines primarily resulted from gains in efficiency, although 2002 also benefited
from higher traffic volume, and 2001 benefited from increased revenue per unit. The efficiency gains in 2002 were principally the
result of the implementation of a new operating plan that emphasizes adherence to a schedule and reductions in service variability.
These improvements came despite a continuing change in the mix of traffic (more resource-intensive traffic, such as automotive and
intermodal, coupled with the decrease in export coal traffic).

The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications.

* Includes $165 million of work-force reduction costs in 2000.

Compensation and benefits

represented 40% of total railway operating
expenses and increased slightly in 2002. Higher wage rates, reduced pension income (see Note 11) and increased health and welfare
benefits costs more than offset savings from reduced employment levels and lower payroll taxes (see the discussion of the Railroad
Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act, below). Medical costs are expected to continue to increase in 2003, a result of higher
costs for active employees and an increase in the expected inflation related to postretirement benefits.

In 2001, compensation and benefits decreased 10%; however, this comparison reflects the $165 million of work-force
reduction costs in 2000. Excluding those costs, compensation and benefits decreased 3%, primarily a result of savings attributable
to the reduced size of the work force, which were somewhat offset by higher wages and benefit costs for union employees, higher
incentive compensation and reduced pension income.

The Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2002, provides for a phased
reduction of the employers' portions of Tier II Railroad Retirement payroll taxes. The phase-in calls for a reduction from 15.6% in
2002 to 14.2% in 2003 and 13.1% in 2004. In addition, the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated. These changes resulted in an
estimated $21 million reduction in payroll taxes in 2002 and are expected to result in savings of $20 million in 2003, compared
with 2002. However, these

K22

savings are expected to be offset by an increase in the railroad unemployment tax rate, higher payroll taxes on
increased wages and a higher wage base. The new law allows for investment of Tier II assets in a diversified portfolio through the
newly established National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. The law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of
future Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a four-year reserve or exceed a six-year reserve.

Materials, services and rents

includes items used for the maintenance of
the railroad's lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs
of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses
increased 1% in 2002 and decreased slightly in 2001.

The increase in 2002 was the result of higher volume-related expenses for automotive and intermodal traffic,
increased material costs for locomotives, higher expenses for roadway and bridge repairs and increased derailment costs. These
higher costs were largely offset by a significant reduction in equipment rents. In 2001, the effects of lower equipment rents were
largely offset by higher costs for purchased services, including expenses for software, consulting and legal fees.

Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or
private owners, less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, decreased 14% in 2002 and 11% in 2001. The decline in 2002
was principally the result of continued improvement in cycle times, reflecting efficiency gains and, for intermodal equipment,
service design and process changes implemented during the year. The decrease in 2001 was primarily due to shorter car cycle times
that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight car and locomotive leases.

Locomotive repair costs increased in 2002 and 2001, principally due to renewed maintenance activity, which is
expected to continue into 2003. Freight car maintenance costs, which were relatively flat in 2002, are also likely to increase in
2003, as it is expected that the economy will recover and more freight cars are due for maintenance.

Conrail rents and services

decreased 2% in 2002 and 12% in 2001. This item
includes amounts due to PRR and CRC for use of their operating properties and equipment and CRC's operation of the Shared Assets
Areas. Also included is NS' equity in Conrail's net earnings, plus the additional amortization related to the difference between
NS' investment in Conrail and its underlying equity (see Note 2). Both declines reflected higher Conrail earnings and lower
expenses in the Shared Assets Areas (see "Conrail's Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity," below).

Depreciation

expense was up slightly in 2002 and increased 2% in 2001.
Substantial levels of capital spending affected both years; however, depreciation expense in 2002 benefited from lower rates
implemented early in the year following completion of a periodic study (see Note 1, "Properties," for NS' depreciation
policy).

Diesel fuel

expenses decreased 17% in 2002 and 14% in 2001. The decline in
2002 reflected a 16% drop in the average price per gallon and slightly lower consumption. Expenses in 2002 included a $10 million
benefit from the hedging program initiated in the second quarter of 2001 (see "Market Risks and Hedging Activities," below and Note
16). The decrease in 2001 was the result of an 8% drop in consumption and a 7% decline in the average price per gallon. Expenses in
2001 included $8 million of cost related to the hedging program. NS expects diesel fuel prices to be higher in 2003.

Casualties and other claims

expenses (including the estimates of costs
related to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased 20% in 2002, but only slightly in 2001. The
increase in 2002 reflected adverse personal injury claims development as indicated by an actuarial study and higher expenses for
loss and damage to lading, as well as higher insurance and environmental remediation costs.

K23

The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. In 2002, cases involving
occupational injuries comprised about 30% of the total employee injury cases settled and 24% of the total settlement payments made.
Injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event, but, rather, result from a claimed exposure over
time. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail
industry for decades. NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs.

The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job-related accidental injury and
occupational claims because of the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads. This law, which
covers employee claims for job-related injuries, produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a
no-fault workers' compensation system.

NS, like many other businesses in the U.S., has experienced difficulty obtaining property and casualty insurance at
reasonable terms since the September 11 terrorist attacks. Thus far, NS has been successful in maintaining a substantial amount of
commercial insurance for third-party personal injury, property damage and FELA claims that exceed the self-insured retention.
However, both the cost of this commercial insurance and the amount of risk that NS retains through self-insurance has more than
doubled since the attacks.

Other expenses

decreased 10% in 2002 and 13% in 2001. The decline in 2002
reflected lower expenses for property and sales and use taxes. The decrease in 2001 was principally the result of lower bad debt
costs, reduced franchise and property taxes, and lower travel and employee-relocation expenses.

Other Income – Net

Other income – net was $66 million in 2002, $99 million in 2001 and $168 million in 2000 (see Note 3). The
decline in 2002 was primarily the result of higher interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities, lower gains from the sale
of properties and investments, and the absence of a $13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement that benefited 2001. These
reductions were partially offset by reduced discount from the sales of receivables (due to a lower amount of receivables sold and a
lower interest rate environment, which favorably affects the amount of discount). The reduction in 2001 resulted from the absence
of $101 million of gains that occurred in 2000 related to the sale of timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests.
This was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and the $13 million nonrecurring settlement
gain. Results in 2001 also included an $18 million gain from a large property sale that closed in December.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense in 2002 was $246 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared with effective rates of 35% in
2001 and 31% in 2000. Excluding the equity in Conrail's after-tax earnings, the effective rates were 38% in 2002 and 2001 and 34%
in 2000.

The effective rates in 2002 and 2001 were higher than that of 2000, primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits
related to coal-seam gas properties. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the
prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities. In addition, 2000 benefited from investments in
coal-seam gas properties. The 2003 effective rate may benefit from the resolution of various tax audits.

In March 2002, the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 was signed into law and began providing immediate
tax incentives for business. A 30% additional first-year depreciation allowance was a primary element of this legislation. This
depreciation incentive continues for three years, and during these years the resulting acceleration of tax depreciation deductions
will improve cash flow by reducing current tax expense and increasing deferred tax expense by significant amounts.

K24

Discontinued Operations

Income from discontinued operations in 2001 consisted of a $13 million after-tax gain related to the sale of NS'
motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17).

FINANCIAL
CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash provided by operating activities,

NS' principal source of liquidity,
was $803 million in 2002, compared with $654 million in 2001 and $1.3 billion in 2000. In 2002, the improvement was the result of
higher income from railway operations and favorable changes in working capital, which were offset, in part, by fewer accounts
receivable sold (see Note 5). Receivable sales declined $270 million in 2002 and $88 million in 2001. The significant decline in
operating cash flow in 2001 reflects the commencement in 2000 of the accounts receivable sales program. Excluding the infusion of
cash in 2000 from the start of this program, operating cash flow declined by $300 million in 2001. The decrease primarily resulted
from an $88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold, higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior
years, an increase in telecommunication receivables, bonus payments in 2001 (no such payments in 2000) and the timing of
payrolls.

A significant portion of payments made to PRR (which are included in "Conrail Rents and Services" and, therefore,
are a use of cash in "Cash provided by operating activities") are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source
of cash in "Proceeds from borrowings." NS' net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $212 million in 2002 and $250 million in
2001.

NS' working capital deficit was $554 million at Dec. 31, 2002, compared with $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2001. The
decline resulted principally from the change in the terms of the note under which NS borrows funds from a subsidiary of PRR (see
Note 2) and a reduction in the amount of debt due within one year. Debt due in 2003 is expected to be paid using cash generated
from operations (including sales of accounts receivable) and cash on hand.

NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale
program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2002, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program
ranged from $368 million to $421 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $30 million to $400 million. Moreover,
NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8); however, reductions in its credit ratings could
limit NS' ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below).

NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is
based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2003 and resume growth in the third and fourth
quarters.

K25

Contractual obligations

at Dec. 31, 2002, related to NS' long-term debt
(including capital leases), operating leases, agreements with CRC, unconditional purchase obligations and other long-term
obligations are as follows:

NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds
from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need
to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58%
of Conrail's contractual obligations for long-term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. Conrail has no
unconditional purchase or other long-term obligations.

NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual
obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see
Note 9).

Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of
accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their
initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has
no obligation related to the buyers' debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of
the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and would retain collections related to the previously sold
receivables (see Note 5).

The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS' option and expires in 2008. The
lessor is a special-purpose entity formed to enter into this transaction, but it is not related to NS and its owner has a
substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance
their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them
to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the
locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a
specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments

K26

under this provision (see Note 9). As the primary beneficiary of the business of the lessor, effective

Jan. 1, 2003, NS consolidated the assets (locomotives) and liabilities (debt) of this special-purpose entity when
it implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (see "New Accounting Pronouncement" on page K34).

Cash used for investing activities

increased 12% in 2002 and 3% in 2001.
Property additions, which account for most of the recurring spending in this category, were down 8% in 2002, following a 2%
increase in 2001. Property sales were significantly lower in 2002, which resulted in the net increase in cash used for investing
activities despite the reduction in capital spending. The following tables show capital spending (including capital leases) and
track and equipment statistics for the past five years.

Capital expenditures (which in 2002 included $6 million of capitalized leases) decreased 7% in 2002, but
increased 2% in 2001. The decline in 2002 reflected lower spending for intermodal facilities, as NS completed in 2001 several
significant projects that expanded the capacity of the intermodal network. Higher spending on track program work was offset by
fewer locomotive purchases (50 in 2002 compared with 100 in 2001). Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases (no
such purchases were made in 2000 as locomotives were leased) that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car
purchases and roadway projects. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, spending for road included fiber-optic infrastructure (see
"Telecommunications Subsidiary," below).

The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2), which comprises 17% of the freight car fleet and
25% of the locomotive fleet.

Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into
high-capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight-car fleet is greater than may be
inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above.

K27

For 2003, NS has budgeted $798 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $499 million for
roadway projects, of which $383 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for communications, signal
and electrical systems, as well as projects for environmental and public improvements such as grade crossing separations and signal
upgrades. Other roadway projects include marketing and industrial development initiatives, including increasing track capacity and
access to coal receivers and vehicle production and distribution facilities, and continuing investments in intermodal
infrastructure. Equipment spending of $246 million includes the purchase of 100 locomotives and upgrades to existing units,
improvements to multilevel automobile racks, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional
security and backup systems.

Cash used for financing activities

in 2002 was $150 million. Financing
activities provided cash of $151 million in 2001 and used cash of $798 million in 2000. The comparisons reflect a net reduction of
debt in 2002, a net increase in 2001 and a net reduction in 2000. The comparison in 2001 also reflected the effects of the
reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities include loan transactions with a subsidiary of PRR that resulted in
net borrowings of $212 million in 2002 and $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2). Excluding
these borrowings, debt was reduced $303 million in 2002, $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The net reduction of debt in
2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS' debt-to-total capitalization ratio
(excluding notes payable to the PRR subsidiary) at year end was 53.1% in 2002 and 55.6% in 2001.

NS currently has in place a $1 billion, five-year credit agreement, which provides for borrowings at prevailing
rates and includes financial covenants (see Note 8).

NS has outstanding $717 million of its 7.05% notes due May 1, 2037. Each holder of a 2037 note may require NS to
redeem all or part of the note at face value, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on May 1, 2004. NS will not know the amount of 2037
notes that it may be required to redeem until April 1, 2004. NS expects to be able to redeem any such notes using cash generated
from operations (including sales of accounts receivable), cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are
inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require management to change them. Accordingly, management
regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other
factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management discusses the development, selection and
disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and
assumptions (see Note 11). These include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans' assets, projected increases in
medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality. In addition, the
amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to
their present value. Management makes these estimates based on the company's historical experience and other information that it
deems pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market performance). Management engages an
independent consulting actuarial firm to aid it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities.

K28

NS' net pension benefit, which is included in "Compensation and benefits" on its Consolidated Income Statement, was
$79 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2002. In recording this amount, NS assumed a long-term investment rate of return of 9%,
compared with the 10% rate used in the previous two years. Investment experience of the pension fund over the past 10-, 15- and
20-year periods has been in excess of 10%. A one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a $20
million change to the pension credit and, as a result, an equal change in "Compensation and benefits" expense. Changes that are
reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings and mortality would not be expected to have
a material effect on NS' net pension benefit or net pension asset in the future. The net pension asset is recorded at its net
present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment; therefore, management has little
discretion in this assumption.

NS' net cost for other postretirement benefits, which is also included in "Compensation and benefits," was $34
million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2002. In recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement
benefits, which is included in "Other benefits" as disclosed in Note 11, management estimated future increases in health-care
costs. These assumptions, along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them, are described in Note 11.

Properties and
Depreciation

Most of NS' total assets are comprised of long-lived railway properties (see Note 6) and its investment in Conrail
(see Note 2). Most of Conrail's assets are long-lived railway properties. As disclosed in Note 1, NS' properties are depreciated
using group depreciation. Rail is depreciated primarily on the basis of use measured by gross-ton miles. Other properties are
depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives. NS reviews the carrying
amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on
future undiscounted cash flows or estimated net realizable value. Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are
recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value. NS is amortizing the excess of the purchase price paid for its investment
in Conrail over its share of Conrail's net equity using the principles of purchase accounting, based primarily on the estimated
remaining useful lives of Conrail's properties.

NS' depreciation expense is based on management's assumptions concerning service lives of its properties as well as
the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement. These assumptions are the product of periodic depreciation
studies that are performed by a firm of consulting engineers. These studies analyze NS' historical patterns of asset use and
retirement and take into account any expected change in operation or maintenance practices. NS' recent experience with these
studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties, these changes have not caused
a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense. The studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated
depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a
component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property. NS' "Depreciation expense"
for the year ended Dec. 31, 2002, amounted to $515 million. NS' weighted-average depreciation rates for 2002 are disclosed in Note
6; a one-tenth percentage point increase (or decrease) in these rates would result in a $17 million increase (or decrease) to NS'
depreciation expense.

Personal Injury, Environmental and Legal Liabilities

NS' expense for "Casualties and other claims" amounted to $171 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2002. Most of
this expense was composed of NS' accrual related to personal injury liabilities (see discussion of FELA in the discussion captioned
"Casualties and other claims" on page K23). NS engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid in valuing its personal
injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during the year. The actuarial firm studies NS' historical patterns of
reserving for claims and subsequent settlements. The actuary also takes into account outside influences considered pertinent. The
study uses the results of these analyses to estimate the ultimate amount of the liability, which includes amounts for incurred but
unasserted claims. NS has recorded this actuarially determined liability. The liability is dependent upon many individual judgments
made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting

K29

actuary and management in the periodic studies. Accordingly, there could be significant changes in the liability,
which NS would recognize when such a change became known. The most recent actuarial study was performed as of June 30, 2002, and
resulted in an increase to NS' personal injury liability during the third quarter. While the liability recorded is supported by the
most recent study, it is reasonably possible that the liability could be higher or lower.

NS is subject to various jurisdictions' environmental laws and regulations.  It is NS' policy to record a
liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably (see Note 18). Environmental
engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability
estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its
environmental policy.

Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $15 million in 2002, $12 million in 2001, and
$11 million in 2000, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2002, 2001 and 2000. Capital
expenditures in 2003 are expected to be comparable to those in 2002.

NS' balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $29 million at Dec. 31,
2002, and $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31,
2002, the liability represented NS' estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 114
identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $16 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to
be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over
a longer period.

At some of the 114 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have
been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose
joint and several liability for cleanup costs.

With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities),
estimates of NS' ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily
imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup
technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant's
share of any estimated loss (and that participant's ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing
liability. NS estimates its environmental remediation liability on a site-by-site basis, using assumptions and judgments that
management deems appropriate for each site. As a result, it is not practical to quantitatively discuss the effects of changes in
these many assumptions and judgments. NS has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities.

The risk of incurring environmental liability – for acts and omissions, past, present and future – is
inherent in the railroad business.  Some of the commodities in NS' traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous
materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize.  In addition, several NS
subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by
others, or held for sale.  Because environmental problems may exist on these properties that are latent or undisclosed, there
can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmentally related liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the
amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time.  Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and
potentially other now-unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time.  The resulting
liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or
quarter.

However, based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, management believes that it has recorded
the probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which the Corporation is aware.  Further, management
believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect
on NS' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

K30

Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally
to railroad operations.  When management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to expenses.  While the ultimate amount of liability
incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments, in management's opinion the recorded liability,
if any, is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims.  However, the final outcome of any of these
lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals
that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.  Any adjustments to recorded liability
will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known.

Income Taxes

NS' net deferred tax liability totaled $3,010 million at Dec. 31, 2002 (see Note 4). This liability is estimated
based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements. After application of the federal
statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate
income tax returns. For state income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various
jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets
will not be realized. NS has only a $24 million valuation allowance on $592 million of deferred tax assets as of Dec. 31, 2002,
reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized. For 2002, 2001 and 2000, the effective tax rates, excluding
NS' equity in Conrail's earnings, were 38%, 38% and 34%, respectively. For every 1/2% change in the 2002 effective tax rate, net
income would have changed by $4 million.

CONRAIL'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Conrail's net income was $180 million in 2002, compared with $174 million in 2001 and $170 million in 2000 (see
Note 2). The increase in 2002 was primarily the result of a favorable federal tax settlement. The improvement in 2001 reflected
lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance
settlements in Conrail's favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of
property.

Conrail's operating revenues were $893 million in 2002, $903 million in 2001 and $985 million in 2000. Both
decreases resulted from the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating
costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2001 also reflected lower revenues at Conrail's Indiana Harbor Belt
subsidiary.

Conrail's operating expenses were $623 million in 2002, $639 million in 2001 and $749 million in 2000. The decrease
in 2002 reflected lower expenses for materials, services and rents and compensation and benefits, which were offset, in part, by
higher costs for casualties and other claims. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and
rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits.

Conrail's cash provided by operations decreased $79 million, or 16%, in 2002, and increased $140 million, or 39%,
in 2001. The decline in 2002 was primarily the result of the absence of two items that benefited 2001: a $50 million cash payment
for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrail's property for 25
years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. This was offset, in part, by favorable changes in working capital. The
increase in 2001 was largely the result of the two unusual items discussed above. Cash generated from operations is Conrail's
principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $59
million in 2002 and $61 million in 2001. Capital expenditures totaled $23 million in 2002 and $47 million in 2001.

K31

Conrail had a working capital deficit of $29 million at Dec. 31, 2002, compared with working capital of $438
million at Dec. 31, 2001, which included $687 million of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and,
therefore, presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its
ongoing obligations.

NS' equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $54 million in 2002, $44 million in 2001 and $21
million in 2000. NS' other comprehensive loss for 2002 and 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders'
Equity, included $34 million and $41 million, respectively, for its portion of Conrail's other comprehensive loss (see Note
13).

OTHER MATTERS

Telecommunications Subsidiary

NS' subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T-Cubed), has
developed fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has experienced a severe
downturn. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T-Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these
assets, as required by SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." To date, based on known
facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered, and accordingly, no
impairment has been recognized (see Note 6).

During 2001, one of T-Cubed's codevelopers, 360networks (USA),inc. ("360"), filed for protection under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. 360 owes T-Cubed amounts for work performed on certain joint projects; and T-Cubed
owes 360 amounts for work performed on other joint projects. The bankruptcy judge has approved set-off of these amounts, leaving
about $7 million due to T-Cubed from 360. T-Cubed has the right to collect this amount from any proceeds due 360 from the sale of
joint assets. Management believes that it will collect this receivable.

T-Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC ("Williams
Communications"), concerning the latter's obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T-Cubed between Cleveland,
Ohio, and northern Virginia. On Jan. 29, 2003, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia entered an
order requiring Williams Communications to pay T-Cubed the remaining amount due for such infrastructure, approximately $36 million,
plus prejudgment interest at a rate of 9% per annum. Williams Communications may elect to appeal. The ability to collect and retain
a judgment against Williams Communications may be limited due to its financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot
now be determined. Its parent, Williams Communications Group, Inc., filed in April 2002 a voluntary petition for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and emerged from bankruptcy in October 2002. Williams Communications was not included
in the bankruptcy petition (see Note 18).

Labor Arbitration

Several hundred claims have been filed with NSR on behalf of employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various
periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection
benefits. Several labor organizations have initiated arbitration on behalf of individual employees. Other disputes are pending
wherein similar benefits are sought under labor agreement provisions that, in management's judgment, do not apply to the involved
circumstances.

Based on known facts, including the availability of legal defenses, management believes that NS will prevail in
these disputes and that any potential liability for the involved claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS' financial
position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of these arbitrations, additional claims may be filed or
progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a
particular quarter (see Note 18).

K32

Labor Agreements

Approximately 24,000 of NS' railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different
labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these
agreements permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly
thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain at this time. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood
of Maintenance of Way Employes (BMWE), which represents about 4,200 NS employees; the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE),
which represents about 4,500 NS employees; the United Transportation Union (UTU), which represents about 6,700 NS employees; the
International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and Blacksmiths (IBB), which represents about 100 NS employees; and the Transportation
Communications International Union (TCU), which represents about 4,400 NS employees. Health and welfare issues have been resolved
with BMWE and TCU. The UTU agreement provides that, subsequent to a further period of negotiation, health and welfare issues may be
submitted to arbitration. Health and welfare issues with the other organizations have not yet been resolved.

Market Risks and Hedging Activities

NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage
its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.

In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to
assist in the management of NS' aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS' operating
margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments.

Diesel fuel costs represented 7% of NS' operating expenses for 2002. The program provides that NS will not enter
into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS' average monthly fuel consumption will
be hedged for any month within any 36-month period.

As of Dec. 31, 2002, through swap transactions, NS has hedged approximately 62% of expected 2003 diesel fuel
requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 73 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and
transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would reduce NS' asset related to the swaps by approximately $30 million as of
Dec. 31, 2002.

NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating-rate debt
instruments and by entering into interest-rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio.

At Dec. 31, 2002, NS' debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled $784 million (excluding debt due to the
PRR subsidiary). A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS' total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt
by approximately $8 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will
result in a material adverse effect on NS' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Some of NS' capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7%, were effectively converted to variable rate
obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2002, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.1%, and the
average receive rate was 7%. During 2002, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $9 million. A portion of the
lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a
yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen-denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily
Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and
Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy.

K33

New Accounting Pronouncements

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations," (SFAS No. 143) which is effective Jan. 1, 2003, and addresses legal obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. In accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts for
Railroad Companies (see Code of Federal Regulations, Title 49, Subtitle B, Chapter X, Part 1201), NS depreciates track structure
(rail, other track material and ties) to its net salvage value (gross salvage less cost to remove). SFAS No. 143 prohibits the
accrual of a liability for removal costs absent a legal obligation to remove the related asset. Management believes that there is
no such legal obligation to remove track. The SEC staff has recently taken a position with a registrant in another industry that
calls into question whether the use of net salvage that results in depreciating more than the cost basis of an asset (negative
salvage) is appropriate once SFAS No. 143 becomes effective. NS is in the process of studying its track accounts to determine where
current depreciation rates will result in negative salvage. To the extent that NS' accumulated depreciation includes such amounts,
they will be removed. The cumulative effect of this catch-up adjustment will be recorded as a change in accounting principle in the
first quarter of 2003. Going forward, this change will result in lower depreciation expense (because the depreciation rate will no
longer reflect any negative salvage) and higher compensation and benefits expenses (for the labor cost to remove retired assets);
NS does not expect that this will result in a material change to its total railway operating expenses.

The FASB has issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," (FIN No. 46), which
addresses consolidation of certain variable interest entities (also commonly referred to as "special purpose entities"). NS adopted
FIN No. 46, effective Jan 1, 2003. As a result, on that date NS consolidated a special-purpose entity that leases certain
locomotives to NS (see Note 9). This entity has no other significant assets or liabilities other than the locomotives and the debt
related to their purchase, which will be reflected on NS' Consolidated Balance Sheet in 2003. This change in reporting will also
have the following effects to NS' Consolidated Income Statement beginning in 2003: operating lease expense will decline, and
depreciation expense and interest expense on debt will increase. The net effect of these income statement changes is not
significant. Adoption of FIN No. 46 did not have a significant effect on NS' financial position or liquidity.

Inflation

Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This
approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital-intensive company, has most of its
capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be
substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.

Trends

Federal Economic Regulation --

Efforts may be made in 2003 to reimpose
unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such
regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose
any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation.

Utility Deregulation --

Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is
expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly
retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of
deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power
producers who are expected to remain competitive in this evolving environment.

Carbon-Based Fuel --

There is growing concern in some quarters that
emissions resulting from burning carbon-based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other
environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy-makers, the impact could
be

K34

either a reduction in the demand for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might
result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal-fired facilities even more difficult.
The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking
statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward-looking
statements reflect management's good-faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on
and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including:
domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight;
competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel
fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and
capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward-looking statements are not, and should
not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of
the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ
materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise
forward-looking statements.

Report of Management

January 28, 2003

To the Stockholders

Norfolk Southern Corporation

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements included in this annual report. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect management's judgments and estimates concerning effects
of events and transactions that are accounted for or disclosed.

Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting. The Corporation's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the
Corporation's ability to record, process, summarize and report reliable financial data. Management recognizes that there are
inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human
error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial
reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in
conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.

In order to ensure that the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting is effective, management
regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of December 31, 2002. This assessment was
based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
assessment, management believes the Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2002.

The Board of Directors, acting through its Audit Committee, is responsible for the oversight of the Corporation's
accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is comprised entirely
of outside directors who are independent of management. The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment and compensation of
the independent auditor, and approves decisions regarding the appointment or removal of the Vice President-Internal Audit. It meets
periodically with management, the independent auditors, and the internal auditors to ensure that they are carrying out their
responsibilities. The Audit Committee is also responsible for performing an oversight role by reviewing and monitoring the
financial, accounting and auditing procedures of the Corporation in addition to reviewing the Corporation's financial reports. The
independent auditors and the internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the Audit Committee, with or without management,
to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, and any other matters which they believe should be brought to
the attention of the Audit Committee.

KPMG LLP, independent auditors of the Corporation's financial statements, has reported on management's assertion
with respect to the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2002.

Independent Auditors'
Report

The Stockholders and Board of Directors

Norfolk Southern
Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Norfolk Southern Corporation and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we have also audited the financial statement schedule as listed in Item 15(A)2. These consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Norfolk Southern Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors

Norfolk Southern
Corporation:

We have examined
management's assertion, included in the accompanying Report of Management, that Norfolk Southern Corporation maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2002 based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Norfolk Southern Corporation's management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's
assertion based on our examination.

Our examination
was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and,
accordingly, included obtaining an understanding of the internal control over financial reporting, testing, and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of the internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Because of
inherent limitations in any internal control, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections
of any evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal
control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management's assertion that Norfolk Southern Corporation maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2002 is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on

criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

NORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The following Notes
are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of
Business

Norfolk Southern Corporation is a Virginia-based holding company engaged principally in the rail transportation
business, operating approximately 21,500 route miles primarily in the East and Midwest. These consolidated financial statements
include Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern) and its majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries (collectively, NS).
Norfolk Southern's major subsidiary is Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR). All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The railroad transports raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods classified in the following market
groups (percent of total railway operating revenues in 2002): coal (23%); automotive (15%); chemicals (12%); metals/construction
(11%); agriculture/consumer products/government (10%); paper/clay/forest products (10%); and intermodal (19%). Ultimate points of
origination or destination for some of the freight (particularly coal bound for export and intermodal containers) are outside the
United States. Approximately 85% of NS' railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor
unions.

Through a jointly owned entity, Norfolk Southern and CSX Corpor­ation own the stock of Conrail Inc., which owns
the major Northeast freight railroad. Norfolk Southern has a 58% economic and 50% voting interest in the jointly owned entity (see
Note 2).

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Management reviews its estimates, including those related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets,
as well as liabilities for litigation, environmental remediation, casualty claims, income taxes, and pension and postretirement
benefits. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.

Cash
Equivalents

"Cash equivalents" are highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity.

Investments

Marketable equity and debt securities are reported at amortized cost or fair value, depending upon their
classification as securities "held-to-maturity," "trading" or "available-for-sale." Unrealized gains and losses for investments
designated as "available-for-sale," net of taxes, are recognized in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss."

Investments, where NS has the ability to exercise significant influence over but does not control the entity, are
accounted for using the equity method in accordance with APB Opinion No. 18, "The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock."

K43

Materials and
Supplies

"Materials and supplies," consisting mainly of fuel oil and items for maintenance of property and equipment, are
stated at the lower of average cost or market. The cost of materials and supplies expected to be used in capital additions or
improvements is included in "Properties."

Properties

"Properties" are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using group depreciation. Rail is depreciated
primarily on the basis of use measured by gross ton-miles. Other properties are depreciated generally using the straight-line
method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives. NS capitalizes interest on major capital projects during the period of
their construction. Expenditures, including those on leased assets, that extend an asset's useful life or increase its utility are
capitalized. Maintenance expense is recognized when repairs are performed. When properties other than land and nonrail assets are
sold or retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost of the assets, net of sale proceeds or salvage, is charged to
accumulated depreciation rather than recognized through income. Gains and losses on disposal of land and nonrail assets are
included in "Other income - net" (see Note 3).

NS reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such
carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows or estimated net realizable value. Assets that are
deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value.

Revenue
Recognition

Revenue is recognized proportionally as a shipment moves from origin to destination. Refunds are recorded as a
reduction to revenues based on management's best estimate of projected liability.

Derivatives

NS does not engage in the trading of derivatives. NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of
volatility in its diesel fuel costs and in the management of its mix of fixed and floating-rate debt. Management has determined
that these derivative instruments qualify as either fair-value or cash-flow hedges, having values that highly correlate with the
underlying hedged exposures and have designated such instruments as hedging transactions. Income and expense related to the
derivative financial instruments is recorded in the same category as generated by the underlying asset or liability. Credit risk
related to the derivative financial instruments is considered to be minimal and is managed by requiring high credit standards for
counterparties and periodic settlements.

Stock-based
Compensation

NS has stock-based employee compensation plans, which are more fully described in Note 12. NS applies the intrinsic
value recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB Opinion No.
25), and related interpretations in accounting for these plans.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if NS had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" (SFAS No.
123), to stock-based employee compensation:

K44

Required
Accounting Changes

The adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets," which was effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on NS' consolidated financial statements.

2. Investment in Conrail and Operations Over Its Lines

Overview

Through a limited liability company, Norfolk Southern and CSX Corporation (CSX) jointly own Conrail Inc. (Conrail),
whose primary subsidiary is Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC), the major freight railroad in the Northeast. NS has a 58% economic
and 50% voting interest in the jointly owned entity, and CSX has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. From time to
time, Norfolk Southern and CSX, as the indirect owners of Conrail, may have to make capital contributions, loans or advances to
Conrail under the terms of the Transaction Agreement among NS, CSX and Conrail.

Operation of
Conrail's Lines

Norfolk Southern's railroad subsidiary, Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR), operates as a part of its rail
system the routes and assets of Pennsylvania Lines LLC (PRR), a wholly owned subsidiary of CRC, pursuant to operating and lease
agreements. CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT) operates the routes and assets of another CRC subsidiary under comparable terms.

The Operating Agreement between NSR and PRR governs substantially all nonequipment assets to be operated by NSR and
has an initial 25-year term, renewable at the option of NSR for two five-year terms. Payments under the Opera­ting Agreement
are subject to adjustment every six years to reflect changes in values. NSR also has leased or subleased for varying terms from PRR
a number of equipment assets. Costs necessary to operate and maintain the PRR assets, including leasehold improvements, are borne
by NSR. NSR receives all freight revenues on the PRR lines.

NSR and CSXT also have entered into agreements with CRC governing other properties that continue to be owned and
operated by CRC (the Shared Assets Areas). NSR and CSXT pay CRC a fee for joint and exclusive access to the Shared Assets Areas. In
addition, NSR and CSXT pay, based on usage, the costs incurred by CRC to operate the Shared Assets Areas.

K45

Future minimum lease payments due to PRR under the Operating Agreement and lease agreements and to CRC under the
Shared Assets Areas (SAA) agreements are as follows:

Operating lease expense related to the agreements, which is included in "Conrail rents and services," amounted to
$468 million in 2002, $467 million in 2001 and $502 million in 2000.

Investment in Conrail

NS is applying the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail in accordance with APB Opinion No. 18,
"The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock." NS is amortizing the excess of the purchase price over Conrail's
net equity using the principles of purchase accounting, based primarily on the estimated remaining useful lives of Conrail's
depreciable property and equipment, including the related deferred tax effect of the differences in tax and accounting bases for
certain assets. At Dec. 31, 2002, the difference between NS' investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity
was $3.7 billion.

NS' consolidated balance sheet at Dec. 31, 2002, includes $60 million of liabilities related to the Conrail
transaction, principally for contractual obligations to Conrail employees imposed by the Surface Transportation Board when it
approved the transaction. Through Dec. 31, 2002, NS had paid $143 million of such costs.

Related-Party Transactions

NS provides certain general and administrative support functions to Conrail, the fees for which are billed in
accordance with several service-provider arrangements and totaled $7 million in 2002, $6 million in 2001 and $7 million in
2000.

"Conrail rents and services" includes: (1) expenses for amounts due to PRR and CRC for use by NSR of operating
properties and equipment and operation of the Shared Assets Areas and (2) NS' equity in the earnings of Con­rail, net of
amortization.

A significant portion of payments made to PRR is borrowed back from a subsidiary of PRR. Previously, these loans
were made under a demand note; however, in the first quarter of 2002, the subsidiary of PRR exchanged this demand note for a new
note due in 2032. As a result, borrowings owed to the subsidiary of PRR now comprise the noncurrent balance "Due to Conrail." The
interest rate for these loans is variable and was 1.82% at Dec. 31, 2002. The current balance "Due to Conrail" at Dec. 31, 2002, is
composed of amounts related to expenses included in "Conrail rents and services," as discussed above. At Dec. 31, 2001, the current
balance "Due to Conrail" included $72 million of such amounts and $301 million of advances owed under the previous demand note.

K46

Summary Financial Information - Conrail

The following historical cost basis financial information should be read in conjunction with Conrail's audited
financial statements, included as Exhibit 99 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Summarized Consolidated Statements of Income - Conrail

Note: Conrail's results for 2000 included gains from the sale of property that had been written up to fair market
value in the allocation of NS' investment in Conrail. Accordingly, the gains related to that fair-value write-up, totaling $17
million after taxes, were excluded in determining NS' equity in Conrail's net income.

Summarized Consolidated Balance Sheets - Conrail

Note: Current assets include amounts due from NS and CSX totaling $158 million at Dec. 31, 2002, and $687 million
at Dec. 31, 2001. Noncurrent assets include amounts due from NS and CSX totaling $892 million at Dec. 31, 2002, and zero at Dec.
31, 2001. Current liabilities include amounts payable to NS and CSX totaling $9 million at Dec. 31, 2002, and $12 million at
Dec. 31, 2001.

K47

3. Other Income - Net

"Other income - net" includes the income generated by the activities of NS' noncarrier subsidiaries as well as the
costs incurred by those subsidiaries in their operations.

"Other current assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes prepaid interest of $46 million at Dec. 31,
2002, and $45 million at Dec. 31, 2001, arising from corporate-owned life insurance borrowings.

4. Income Taxes

Provision for Income Taxes

K48

Reconciliation of Statutory Rate to Effective Rate

Total income taxes as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income differ from the amounts computed by
applying the statutory federal corporate tax rate as follows:

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

Certain items are reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recorded in recognition of these differences.

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and
deferred tax liabilities are as follows:

Except for amounts for which a valuation allowance has been provided, management believes the other deferred tax
assets will be realized. The total valuation allowance increased $6 million in 2002, $6 million in 2001 and $3 million in 2000.

K49

Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) Reviews

Consolidated federal income tax returns have been examined and Revenue Agent Reports have been received for all
years up to and including 1996. The consolidated federal income tax returns for 1997, 1998 and 1999 are being audited by the IRS.
Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any additional taxes and interest thereon that might arise as a
result of IRS examinations.

5. Accounts Receivable

In May 2000, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary of NS began selling without recourse undivided
ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable. Upon commencement of this program, NS received cash proceeds of $460 million.
The buyers have a priority collection interest in the entire pool of receivables and, as a result, NS has retained credit risk to
the extent the pool of receivables exceeds the amount sold. NS services and collects the receivables on behalf of the buyers;
however, no servicing asset or liability has been recognized because the benefits of servicing are estimated to be just adequate to
compensate NS for its responsibilities. Payments collected from sold receivables can be reinvested in new accounts receivable on
behalf of the buyers. Should NS' credit rating drop below investment grade, the buyers have the right to discontinue this
reinvestment.

Accounts receivable sold under this arrangement, and therefore not included in "Accounts receivable, net" on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $30 million at Dec. 31, 2002, and $300 million at Dec. 31, 2001. The fees associated with the
sale, which are based on the buyers' financing costs, are included in "Other income – net" (see Note 3). NS' retained
interest, which is included in "Accounts receivable, net," is recorded at fair value using estimates of dilution based on NS'
historical experience. These estimates are adjusted regularly based on NS' actual experience with the pool, including defaults and
credit deterioration. NS has historically experienced very low levels of default. If historical dilution percentages were to
increase one percentage point, the value of NS' retained interest would be reduced by approximately $5 million.

NS' allowance for doubtful accounts was $5 million at Dec. 31, 2002, and Dec. 31, 2001.

6. Properties

Included in properties is approximately $110 million of telecommunications assets consisting of fiber optic
conduit. NS evaluated the recoverability of these assets at Dec. 31, 2002, and based on known facts and circumstances, management
believes that its investment in these assets will be recovered.

Railway property includes $480 million at Dec. 31, 2002 and $474 million at Dec. 31, 2001, of assets recorded
pursuant to capital leases. Other property includes the costs of obtaining rights to natural resources of $341 million at
Dec. 31, 2002 and 2001.

K50

Capitalized
Interest

Total interest cost incurred on debt in 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $529 million, $570 million and $569 million,
respectively, of which $11 million, $17 million and $18 million was capitalized.

7. Current Liabilities

8. Long-term Debt

K51

Each holder of a 2037 note may require NS to redeem all or part of the note at face value, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, on May 1, 2004.

The railroad equipment obligations and the capitalized leases are secured by liens on the underlying equipment.

Certain lease obligations require the maintenance of yen-denominated deposits, which are pledged to the lessor to
satisfy yen-denominated lease payments. These deposits are included in "Other assets" on the balance sheet and totaled
$86 million at Dec. 31, 2002, and $78 million at Dec. 31, 2001.

Shelf
Registration

NS filed on Form S-3 a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Com­mission covering the
issu­ance of up to $1 billion of secur­ities. As of Dec. 31, 2002, NS had issued a total of $550 million of notes under
this shelf registration.

Commercial Paper
and Credit Agreement

NS has the ability to issue commercial paper backed by a $1 billion credit agreement that expires in 2006. At Dec.
31, 2002, and Dec. 31, 2001, NS had no commercial paper outstanding. Any borrowings under the credit agreement are contingent on
the continuing effectiveness of the representations and warranties made at the inception of the agreement.

Debt Covenants

NS is subject to various financial covenants with respect to its debt and under its credit agreement, including a
minimum net worth requirement, a maximum leverage ratio restriction and certain restrictions on issuance of further debt. At
Dec. 31, 2002, NS was in compliance with all debt covenants.

9.
Lease Commitments

NS is committed under long-term lease agree­ments, which expire on various dates through 2067, for equipment,
lines of road and other property. The following amounts do not include payments to PRR under the Operating Agreement and lease
agreements or to CRC under the SAA agreements (see Note 2). Future minimum lease payments and operating lease expense, other than
to PRR and CRC, are as follows:

K52

Operating Lease
Expense

During 2000, NS entered into an operating lease for 140 locomotives, which is renewable annually at NS' option, has
a maximum term of eight years and includes purchase options. Because the fixed, noncancellable term of the lease is one year,
future minimum lease payments in the table above do not include amounts related to this lease. However, operating lease expense in
the table above does include amounts related to this lease as follows: $13 million in 2002, $18 million in 2001 and $11 million in
2000. If NS does not renew the lease during the eight-year period or does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum
lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not
expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. As of Dec. 31, 2002, the maximum liability under this provision,
assuming NS chose not to renew the lease in 2003 and the then fair value of the locomotives was zero, would be $116 million. The
lessor is a special-purpose entity whose activities are limited to those incident to this particular transaction. Upon adoption of
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which will occur in
2003, NS will consolidate this entity. As a result, the locomotives will be shown as assets, debt will increase, operating lease
expense will decline, depreciation expense will increase and interest expense on debt will increase.

10. Other Liabilities

11.  PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans covering
principally salaried employees. Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries also provide specified health care and death benefits to
eligible retired employees and their dependents. Under the present plans, which may be amended or terminated at NS' option, a
defined percentage of health care expenses is covered, reduced by any deductibles, copayments, Medicare payments and, in some
cases, coverage provided under other group insurance policies.

K53

Pension and Other
Postretirement Benefit Obligations and Plan Assets

Of the pension plans included above, the unfunded pension plans were the only plans with an accumulated benefit
obligation in excess of plan assets. These plans' accumulated benefit obligations were $82 million at Dec. 31, 2002, and $79
million at Dec. 31, 2001. These plans' projected benefit obligations were $94 million at Dec. 31, 2002 and $89 million at Dec. 31,
2001. Because of the nature of such plans, there are no plan assets.

NS received Section 401(h) account transfers, from pension assets, of $18 million in 2002 and $14 million in 2001
as reimbursement for medical payments for retirees.

Legislative changes primarily resulting from the December 2001 amendment to the Railroad Retirement Act ("The Act")
increased benefits payable to certain retirees covered by The Act. Since employees' pension benefits paid by NS are offset by a
portion of benefits paid under The Act, the amendment served to reduce NS' obligation by approximately $19 million at Dec. 31,
2001.

During 2001, NS amended its qualified and nonqualified pension plans to enhance benefits to certain NS employees.
The amendments increased the pension benefit obligation by $6 million at Dec. 31, 2001. During 2000, NS amended its qualified
pension plan to allow for the payment of qualifying disability benefits.

K54

Pension and Other
Postretirement Benefit Costs Components

Pension
Assumptions

Pension and other postretirement benefit costs are determined based on actuarial valuations that reflect
appropriate assumptions as of the measurement date, ordinarily the beginning of each year. The funded status of the plans is
determined using appropriate assumptions as of each year end. A summary of the major assumptions follows:

Health Care Cost
Trend Assumptions

For measurement purposes, increases in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits were assumed to be 10%
for 2003 and 9% for 2004. It is assumed the rate will decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of 5.0% for 2008 and remain at that
level thereafter.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements.
To illustrate, a one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend would have the following effects:

K55

Other
Postretirement Coverage

Under collective bargaining agreements, NS and certain subsidiaries participate in a multi-employer benefit plan,
which provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible union employees. Premiums under this plan
are expensed as incurred and amounted to $11 million in 2002, $10 million in 2001 and $7 million in 2000.

401(k) Plans

Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries provide 401(k) savings plans for employees. Under the plans, NS matches a
portion of employee contributions, subject to applicable limitations. Since 1999, NS has contributed newly issued shares of Common
Stock for its matching contributions. NS' expenses under these plans were $12 million in 2002, $11 million in 2001 and $12
million in 2000.

Early Retirement Programs in 2000

During 2000, NS offered two voluntary early retirement programs to its salaried employees. The principal incentives
offered in these programs were enhanced pension benefits, the cost for most of which will be paid from NS' overfunded pension plan.
A February program was accepted by 919 of 1,180 eligible employees, and a December program was accepted by 370 of 846 eligible
employees. The total cost of these programs, which is included in "Compensation and benefits," was $133 million. The resulting
noncash reduction to NS' pension plan asset is included in "Other - net" in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

12. Stock-based Compensation

Under the stockholder-approved Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), a committee of nonemployee directors of the Board
may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and performance share units (PSUs), up to a maximum
88,025,000 shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock (Common Stock). Of these shares, 5,000,000 were approved by the Board for
issuance to non-officer participants; as a broadly based issuance, stockholder approval was not required. Under the Board-approved
Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan (TSOP), the committee may grant stock options up to a maximum of 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
Options may be granted for a term not to exceed 10 years, but may not be exercised prior to the first anniversary of the date of
grant. Options are exercisable at the fair market value of Common Stock on the date of grant.

The LTIP also permits the payment –- on a current or a deferred basis and in cash or in stock -– of
dividend equivalents on shares of Common Stock covered by options or PSUs in an amount commensurate with dividends paid on Common
Stock. Tax absorption payments also are authorized in amounts estimated to equal the federal and state income taxes applicable to
shares of Common Stock issued subject to a share retention agreement.

Accounting Method

As disclosed in Note 1, NS applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in accounting for awards made under
the plans. Accordingly, grants of PSUs, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, tax absorption payments and SARs result in charges
to net income, while grants of stock options have no effect on net income. Related compensation costs were $23 million in 2002,
$20 million in 2001 and $5 million in 2000. NS recognized additional paid-in capital of $6 million in 2002, $1 million in 2001
and zero in 2000 related to the tax benefit generated by stock option exercises.

Note 1 includes a table that illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share had NS applied the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation. The pro forma amounts include compensation costs
calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with average expected option lives of five years; average risk-free
interest rates of 4.6% in 2002, 5.1% in 2001 and 6.8% in

K56

2000; average stock-price volatilities of 32% in 2002, 39% in 2001 and 33% in 2000; and dividend yields of zero in
2002, 2% in 2001 and 3% in 2000. These assumptions produced per-share grant-date fair values of $8.26 in 2002, $5.48 in 2001, and
$5.22 in 2000.

Stock Option Activity

Of the total options outstanding at Dec. 31, 2002, 30 million were vested and have a weighted-average exercise
price of $23.71.

Stock Options
Outstanding

Performance Share
Units

PSUs provide for awards based on achievement of certain predetermined corporate performance goals at the end of a
three-year cycle. PSU grants and average grant-date fair market values were 815,000 and $22.49 in 2002; 817,500 and $15.48 in 2001;
and 937,500 and $16.94 in 2000. PSUs may be paid in the form of shares of Common Stock, cash or any combination thereof. Shares
earned and issued may be subject to share retention agreements and held by NS for up to five years.

K57

Shares Available and Issued

Shares of stock available for future grants and issued in connection with all features of the LTIP and TSOP are as
follows:

13. Stockholders' Equity

Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Loss

"Accumulated other comprehensive loss" reported in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity
consisted of the following:

K58

"Other comprehensive income (loss)" reported in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity
consisted of the following:

In 2002 and 2001, Conrail recorded a $59 million and a $70 million loss, respectively, in other comprehensive
income related to an increase in its minimum pension liability. NS' "Other comprehensive loss" includes $34 million for 2002 and
$41 million for 2001, arising from the Conrail adjustments.

Undistributed
Earnings of Equity Investees

"Retained income" includes undistributed earnings of equity investees, principally attributable to NS' equity in
the earnings of Conrail, of $375 million at Dec. 31, 2002; $355 million at Dec. 31, 2001; and $351 million at Dec. 31, 2000.

K59

14. Earnings Per Share

The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

These calculations exclude options for which the exercise price exceeded the average market price of Common Stock
as follows: 24 million in 2002, 21 million in 2001 and 26 million in 2000.

There are no adjustments to "Net income" or "Income from continuing operations" for the diluted earnings per share
computations.

15. Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The fair values of "Cash and cash equivalents," "Short-term investments," "Accounts receivable" and "Accounts
payable" approximate carrying values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. The fair value of
corporate-owned life insurance approximates carrying value. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values for the remaining
financial instruments, excluding derivatives (see Note 16) and investments accounted for under the equity method in accordance with
APB Opinion No. 18, consisted of the following at Dec. 31:

Quoted market prices were used to determine the fair value of marketable securities; underlying net assets were
used to estimate the fair value of other investments. The fair values of notes receivable are based on future discounted cash
flows. The fair values of debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flows using current interest rates
for debt with similar terms, company rating and remaining maturity.

K60

Carrying amounts of marketable securities reflect unrealized holding gains of $1 million on Dec. 31, 2002, and
$10 million on Dec. 31, 2001. Sales of "available-for-sale" securities were immaterial for the years ended Dec. 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000.

16. Derivative Financial Instruments

On Jan. 1, 2001, NS adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133), as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, "Accounting for
Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities" (SFAS 138). The Statements establish accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, requiring that all derivatives be recognized in the financial
statements as either assets or liabilities and that they be measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded as
adjustments to the assets or liabilities being hedged in "Other comprehensive income," or in current earnings, depending on whether
the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting, the type of hedge transaction represented and the effectiveness of
the hedge.

NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage
its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. NS does not engage in the trading of derivatives. Management has determined
that its derivative financial instruments qualify as either fair-value or cash-flow hedges, having values that highly correlate
with the underlying hedged exposures, and has designated such instruments as hedging transactions. Credit risk related to the
derivative financial instruments is considered to be minimal and is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties
and periodic settlements.

Diesel Fuel Hedging

In the second quarter of 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of
the program is to assist in the management of NS' aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly
affect NS' operating margins and profitability. In order to minimize this risk, NS instituted a continuous hedging strategy for a
portion of its estimated future fuel needs by entering into a series of swaps in order to lock in the purchase prices of some of
its diesel fuel. Management has designated these derivative instruments as cash-flow hedges of the exposure to variability in
expected future cash flows attributable to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices.

Following is a summary of NS' diesel fuel swaps:

Hedges are placed each month by competitive bid among selected counterparties. The goal of this hedging strategy is
to average fuel costs over an extended period of time while minimizing the incremental cost of hedging. The program provides that
NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS' average
monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36-month period. Diesel fuel costs represented 7%, 8% and 9% of
NS' operating expenses for the years ended Dec. 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

K61

In 2001, NS also purchased eight monthly call options at a strike price of 84 cents per gallon of Nymex No. 2
heating oil. The cost of the monthly options, which expired serially through Dec. 31, 2001, was amortized as a component of diesel
fuel expense. Because the price of diesel fuel did not reach the strike price at any time during the period the options were
outstanding, NS did not record any benefit related to these transactions.

NS' fuel hedging activity resulted in a net decrease in 2002 diesel fuel expense of $10 million and a net increase
in 2001 diesel fuel expense of $8 million. Ineffectiveness related to the use of diesel fuel hedges in 2002 and 2001 was less than
$1 million for each year.

Interest Rate Hedging

NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating-rate debt
instruments, and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions. NS had $220 million, or 3.2%, and $251 million, or 3.5%, of
its fixed rate debt portfolio hedged at Dec. 31, 2002, and Dec. 31, 2001, respectively, using interest rate swaps that qualify for
and are designated as fair-value hedge transactions. These swaps have been effective in hedging the changes in fair value of the
related debt arising from changes in interest rates and, accordingly, there has been no impact on earnings resulting from
ineffectiveness associated with these derivative transactions.

Fair Values

The fair values of NS' diesel fuel derivative instruments at Dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, were determined based upon
current fair market values as quoted by third party dealers. Fair values of interest rate swaps were determined based upon the
present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the appropriate implied spot rate from the spot rate yield curve. Fair
value adjustments are noncash transactions and, accordingly, are excluded from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
"Accumulated other comprehensive loss," a component of "Stockholders' equity," included $29 million (pretax) at Dec. 31, 2002,
relating to an increase, and $15 million (pretax) at Dec. 31, 2001, relating to a decrease in the fair value of derivative fuel
hedging transactions that will terminate within 12 months.

The asset and liability positions of NS' outstanding derivative financial instruments were as follows:

17. Discontinued Operations - Motor Carrier

On March 28, 1998, NS sold all the common stock of North American Van Lines, Inc. (NAVL), its motor carrier
subsidiary. Results in 2001 include an additional after-tax gain of $13 million, or 3 cents per share, that resulted from the
expiration of certain indemnities contained in the sales agreement.

18. Commitments and Contingencies

Lawsuits

Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally
to railroad operations. When management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to expenses. While the ultimate amount of liability incurred
in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments, in management's opinion the recorded liability is adequate
to cover the future payment of such liability. However, the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted
with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of
operations in a particular year or quarter. Any adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in expenses in the periods
in which such adjustments are known.

Presently, there are two matters, one involving labor arbitration and other claims for "New York Dock" and other
income protection benefits and the other involving contractual obligations of a fiber optic codeveloper, Williams Communications,
LLC ("Williams Communications"), where the aggregated range of loss could be from zero to $75 million. Management believes that NS
will prevail in both these matters. On January 29, 2003, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
entered an order requiring Williams Communications to pay T-Cubed approximately $36 million, plus prejudgment interest at a rate of
9% per annum, in connection with its contractual obligations to T-Cubed. Williams Communications may elect to appeal. The ability
to collect and retain the $36 million receivable due from Williams Communications may be limited because of its financial
condition. The shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. Its parent, Williams Communications Group, Inc., filed in April 2002 a
voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and emerged from bankruptcy in October 2002.
Williams Communications was not included in the bankruptcy petition. Unfavorable outcomes in either of these matters could result
in accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.

Casualty Claims

NS is generally self-insured for casualty claims. Claims in excess of self-insurance levels are insured up to
excess coverage limits. The casualty claims liability is determined actuarially, based upon claims filed and an estimate of claims
incurred but not yet reported. While the ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on future developments, in management's
opinion, the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payments of claims. However, it is possible that the recorded
liability may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims. Adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in
operating expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known.

Environmental
Matters

NS is subject to various jurisdictions' environmental laws and regulations. It is NS' policy to record a liability
where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for
recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables in the balance sheet and are not netted against the
associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in
determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council,
composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy.

NS' balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $29 million at Dec. 31,
2002, and $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31,
2002, the liability represented NS' estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 114
identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $16 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to
be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over
a longer period.

K63

At some of the 114 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have
been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose
joint and several liability for cleanup costs.

With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities),
estimates of NS' ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily
imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup
technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant's
share of any estimated loss (and that participant's ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing
liability.

The risk of incurring environmental liability – for acts and omissions, past, present and future – is
inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS' traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous
materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries
own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for
sale. Because environmental problems may exist on these properties that are latent or undisclosed, there can be no assurance that
NS will not incur environmentally related liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of
which cannot be estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other now-unidentified
environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

However, based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, management believes that it has recorded
the probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which the Corporation is aware. Further, management believes
that it is unlikely that any identified matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on
NS' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Purchase
Commitments

NSR had outstanding purchase commitments of approximately $164 million in connection with its 2003 capital program.
In addition, Norfolk Southern has committed to purchase telecommunications services totaling $38 million through 2006.

Change-In-Control
Arrangements

Norfolk Southern has compensation agreements with officers and certain key employees that become operative only
upon a change in control of the Corporation, as defined in those agreements. The agreements provide generally for payments based on
compensation at the time of a covered individual's involuntary or other specified termination and for certain other benefits.

Guarantees

In a number of instances, NS and its subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify lenders for additional costs they may
bear as a result of certain changes in laws or regulations applicable to their loans. Such changes may include impositions or
modifications with respect to taxes, duties, reserves, liquidity, capital adequacy, special deposits, and similar requirements
relating to extensions of credit by, deposits with, or the assets or liabilities of such lenders. Similar provisions exist in NS'
accounts receivable sales program. The nature and timing of changes in laws or regulations applicable to NS' financings are
inherently unpredictable, and therefore NS' exposure in connection with the foregoing indemnifications cannot be quantified. No
liability has been recorded related to these indemnifications. In the case of one type of equipment financing, NSR's Japanese
leveraged leases, NSR may terminate the leases and ancillary agreements if such a change-in-law indemnity is triggered. Such a
termination would require NSR to make early termination payments that would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on
NS' financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

K64

NS has indemnified parties in a number of transactions for U.S. income tax withholding imposed as a result of
changes in U.S. tax law. In all cases, NS has the right to unwind the related transaction if the withholding cannot be avoided in
the future. Because these indemnities would be triggered and are dependent upon a change in the tax law, the maximum exposure is
not quantifiable. Management does not believe that it is likely that it will be required to make any payments under these
indemnities.

Norfolk Southern has indemnified the purchaser of North American Van Lines, Inc. (see Note 17) for tax liabilities
related to tax years ended on or before the date of sale. The maximum exposure is not quantifiable; however, NS has recorded a
reserve for its expected liability under this indemnification. It is unlikely that any additional payments would have a material
adverse effect on NS' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

NS has outstanding warranty liabilities primarily related to work performed at its locomotive facilities. NS has
recorded a reserve of less than $2 million as of Dec. 31, 2002 and 2001 for these warranties.

As of Dec. 31, 2002, certain Norfolk Southern subsidiaries are contingently liable as guarantors with respect to $8
million of indebtedness of an entity in which it has an ownership interest, the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis, due in
2019. Six other railroads are also jointly and severally liable as guarantors for this indebtedness. No liability has been recorded
related to this guaranty.

NS is liable for any shortfall in the then fair market value of certain leased locomotives and a specified residual
value for the locomotives if the leases are not renewed, as discussed in Note 9.

Equity Compensation Plan Information

Norfolk Southern Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP")

Established on June 28, 1983, and approved by the stockholders at their Annual Meetings on May 10, 1984, on May 11,
1995, and most recently on May 10, 2001, LTIP was adopted to promote the success of Norfolk Southern by providing an opportunity
for officers and other key employees to acquire a proprietary interest in the Corporation. On January 23, 2001, the Board of
Directors approved the issuance of an additional 5,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock under LTIP to
participants who are not officers of Norfolk Southern. The issuance of these shares was broadly-based, and stockholder approval of
these shares was not required. Accordingly, this portion of LTIP is included in the number of securities available for future
issuance for plans not approved by stockholders. The Board also adopted an amended plan effective January 23, 2001, subject to
stockholder approval, which included the reservation for issuance of an additional 30,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued
Norfolk Southern Common Stock, with no more than 6 million of such additional shares to be awarded as restricted shares or
performance shares (including performance share units earned as performance shares). This amended plan was approved by stockholders
on May 10, 2001, resulting in an aggregate of 74,878,604 shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under LTIP.

Non-employee directors, officers and other key employees residing in the United States or Canada are eligible for
selection to receive LTIP awards. Under LTIP, the Performance-Based Compensation Committee (Committee) may grant incentive stock
options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares and performance share units (in addition,
dividend equivalents may be awarded for options and performance share units). The Committee may establish such terms and conditions
for the awards as provided in the plan.

K67

For options, the option price per share will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of Norfolk Southern's
Common Stock on the effective date the option is granted. All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and the
term of the option will not exceed ten years. LTIP specifically prohibits option repricing without stockholder approval, except for
capital adjustments.

Performance share units are performance-based awards which are earned upon achievement of goals the Committee
establishes at the time of the grant for three equally weighted performance criteria approved by the stockholders -- return on
average invested capital, operating ratio, and total return to NS stockholders as compared with the total return on all stocks
comprising the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index -- and the units may be payable as shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock
or in cash.

Norfolk Southern Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan

The Board adopted the Norfolk Southern Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan ("TSOP") on January 26, 1999, to
promote the success of Norfolk Southern by providing an opportunity for nonagreement employees to acquire a proprietary interest in
Norfolk Southern and thereby to provide an additional incentive to nonagreement employees to devote their maximum efforts and
skills to the advancement, betterment, and prosperity of Norfolk Southern and its stockholders. The plan has not been approved by
stockholders. Six million shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock were reserved for issuance under TSOP.

Active full-time nonagreement employees residing in the United States or Canada are eligible for selection to
receive TSOP awards. Under TSOP, the Compensation and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors may grant nonqualified stock
options and may establish such terms and conditions as provided in the plan.

The option price per share will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of Norfolk Southern's Common Stock
on the effective date the option is granted. All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and the term of the
option will not exceed ten years. TSOP specifically prohibits option repricing without stockholder approval, except for capital
adjustments.

Norfolk Southern Corporation Directors' Restricted Stock Plan

The Norfolk Southern Corporation Directors' Restricted Stock Plan ("Plan") was adopted on January 1, 1994, and is
designed to increase ownership of Norfolk Southern's Common Stock by its non-employee directors so as to further align their
ownership interest in Norfolk Southern with that of stockholders. The Plan has not been approved by stockholders. Currently, a
maximum of 66,000 shares of Corporation Common Stock may be granted under the Plan. To make the grants to eligible directors,
Norfolk Southern purchases, through one or more subsidiary companies, the number of shares required in open-market transactions at
prevailing market prices, or makes such grants from Common Stock already owned by one or more of Norfolk Southern's subsidiary
companies.

Only non-employee directors, who are not and never have been employees of Norfolk Southern, are eligible to
participate in the Plan. Upon becoming a director, each eligible director receives a one-time grant of 3,000 restricted shares of
Norfolk Southern Common Stock. No individual member of the Board exercises discretion concerning the eligibility of any director or
the number of shares granted.

The restriction period begins on the date of the grant and ends on the earlier of six months after the eligible
director ceases to be a director by reason of disability, retirement or death. Directors will forfeit the right to receive the
restricted shares if they cease to serve as a director of Norfolk Southern for reasons other than their disability, retirement or
death.

K68

Norfolk Southern Corporation Safety Incentive Plan

The Norfolk Southern Corporation Safety Incentive Plan ("SIP") is designed to provide an additional incentive for
eligible agreement employees to work safely. Under the plan, eligible employees who work without injury during the year receive a
safety award payable in shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock. A SIP award is between five and eight shares of stock.

SIP is broadly-based and has not been approved by stockholders. Shares of Common Stock issued under its terms are
not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, pursuant to a no-action letter issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on
November 20, 1992. Accordingly, SIP does not define a specific amount of authorized shares for issuance under the plan. The Board
has approved using up to 500,000 authorized but unissued shares for awards under the plan, and the number of shares remaining under
this authorization are included in the number of securities available for future issuance for plans not approved by
shareholders.
