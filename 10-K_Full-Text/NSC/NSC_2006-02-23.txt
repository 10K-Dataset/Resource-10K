GENERAL -

Norfolk Southern
Corporation (
Norfolk
 Southern) was incorporated on

July 23, 1980
, under the laws of the
Commonwealth
 of
Virginia
..
 
On June l, 1982, Norfolk Southern
acquired control of two major operating railroads, Norfolk and Western Railway
Company (NW) and Southern Railway Company (Southern) in accordance with an Agreement
of Merger and Reorganization dated as of July 31, 1980, and with the approval
of the transaction by the Interstate Commerce Commission
 
(now the Surface Transportation Board
[STB]).
 
Effective
Dec. 31, 1990
,
Norfolk
 Southern transferred all
the common stock of NW to Southern, and Southern's name was changed to Norfolk
Southern Railway Company (Norfolk Southern Railway or NSR).
 
Effective
Sept.
 1, 1998
, NW was merged with and into Norfolk Southern Railway.
 
As of
Dec.
 31, 2005
, all the common stock of Norfolk Southern Railway was owned directly
by
Norfolk
 Southern.

Through
a limited liability company,
Norfolk
 Southern and CSX
Corporation (CSX) jointly own Conrail Inc. (Conrail), whose primary
subsidiary is Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC).
 
Norfolk
 Southern has a 58% economic
and 50% voting interest in the jointly owned entity, and CSX has the remainder
of the economic and voting interests.
 

CRC owns and operates certain properties (the Shared Assets Areas) for
the joint and exclusive benefit of NSR and CSX Transportation Inc. (CSXT).
 
On
June 1,
,
NSR and CSXT, began operating separate portions of Conrail’s rail routes
and assets.
 
On August 27, 2004, NS,
CSX and Conrail completed a corporate reorganization of Conrail (Conrail
Corporate Reorganization), which established direct ownership and control by
NSR and CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT) of two former CRC subsidiaries,
Pennsylvania Lines LLC (PRR) and New York Central Lines LLC (NYC), respectively
(See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Norfolk
Southern makes available free of charge through its website, www.nscorp.com,
its annual report on Form 10‑K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,
current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as
reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or
furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
 
Additionally, Norfolk Southern’s
corporate governance guidelines, board committee charters, code of ethics
and code of ethical conduct for senior financial officers are available on the
company’s website and in print to any shareholder who requests them.

RAILWAY
OPERATING REVENUES --

NS' total railway operating revenues were $8.5 billion
in 2005.
 
See the financial
information by traffic segment in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.”

COAL

TRAFFIC

--

Coal, coke and iron ore -- most of which is
bituminous coal -- is NS' railroads' largest commodity group as measured
by revenues.
 
The railroads handled
a total of 187 million tons in 2005, most of which originated on NS' lines
in
West Virginia
,
Virginia
,
Pennsylvania
 and
Kentucky
..
 
Revenues from coal, coke and iron ore
accounted for about 25% of NS' total railway operating revenues in 2005.

Total
coal handled through all system ports in 2005 was 38 million tons.
 
Of this total, 12 million tons
(including coastwise traffic) moved through
Norfolk
,
Virginia
, 4 million tons moved
through the Baltimore Terminal, 14 million tons moved to various docks on
the
Ohio
 River
,
and 8 million tons moved to various
Lake Erie
 ports.
 
Other than coal for export, virtually
all coal handled by NS' railroads was terminated in states east of the
Mississippi River
..

See
the discussion of coal traffic, by type of coal, in Part II, Item 7,
“Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.”

GENERAL
MERCHANDISE

TRAFFIC

-

General merchandise
traffic is composed of five major commodity groupings:  automotive;
chemicals; metals and construction; agriculture, consumer products and
government; and paper, clay and forest products.
 
The automotive group includes finished
vehicles for BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda,
Isuzu, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saab,
Subaru, Suzuki,
Toyota
 and Volkswagen, and auto
parts for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz and
Toyota
..
 
The chemicals group includes sulfur and
related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds,
plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes and municipal wastes.
 
The metals and construction group
includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates,
bricks and minerals.
 
The
agriculture, consumer products and government group includes soybeans, wheat,
corn, fertilizer, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned
goods, sweeteners, consumer products, ethanol and items for the military.
 
The paper, clay and forest products
group includes lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood
fibers, wood pulp, scrap paper and clay.

In
2005, 144 million tons of general merchandise freight, or approximately
66% of total general merchandise tonnage handled by NS, originated online.
 
The balance of general merchandise
traffic was received from connecting carriers at interterritorial
gateways.
 
The principal interchange
points for NS-received traffic included
Chicago
,
Memphis
,
New Orleans
,
Cincinnati
,
Kansas
 City,
Detroit
,
Hagerstown
, St. Louis/East St. Louis
and
Louisville
..
 

General merchandise carloads handled in 2005 were 2.9 million, the
revenue from which accounted for 54% of NS’ total railway operating
revenues in 2005.

See
the discussion of general merchandise rail traffic by commodity group in
Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.”

INTERMODAL

TRAFFIC

-

The intermodal market consists of shipments moving
in trailers, domestic and international containers, and Roadrailer®
equipment.
 
These shipments are
handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship
lines, truckers and other shippers.
 

Intermodal units handled in 2005 were 3.2 million, the revenues
from which accounted for 21% of NS’ total railway operating revenues for
the year.

See
the discussion of intermodal traffic in Part II, Item 7, “Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.”

FREIGHT
RATES -

In
2005, NS' railroads continued their reliance on private contracts and exempt
price quotes as their predominant pricing mechanisms.
 
Thus, a major portion of NS' railroads'
freight business is not currently economically regulated by the
government.
 
In general, market
forces have been substituted for government regulation and now are the primary
determinant of rail service prices. In 2005, coal movements that had been
moving under common carrier (tariff) rates to Duke Energy and Carolina Power
and Light power plants began moving under contract rates as part of the
settlement agreements resolving the rail transportation rate cases brought by
each of the utilities.
 
In 2004
there were significant coal movements moving under common carrier (tariff)
rates that had previously moved under rates contained in transportation
contracts.

In
2005, NS' railroads were found by the STB to be “revenue adequate”
based on results for the year 2004.
 

A railroad is “revenue adequate” under the applicable law
when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry's composite cost of
capital.
 
This determination is made
pursuant to a statutory requirement.

PASSENGER
OPERATIONS -

Regularly scheduled passenger trains are operated by Amtrak on
NS' lines between
Alexandria
 and
New Orleans
, between
Greensboro
 and
Selma
,
North Carolina
, between
Chicago
,
Illinois
, and
Detroit
,
Michigan
, and between
Chicago
 and
Harrisburg
,
Pennsylvania
..
 
Commuter trains are operated on the NS
line between
Manassas
 and
Alexandria
 in accordance with
contracts with two transportation commissions of the
Commonwealth
 of
Virginia
..
 
NS also leases the
Chicago
 to
Manhattan
,
Illinois
, line to the Commuter Rail
Division of the Regional Transportation Authority of Northeast Illinois.
 
NS operates lines on which Amtrak
conducts regularly scheduled passenger operations.
 
In addition, NS provides freight service
over lines with significant ongoing Amtrak and commuter passenger operations,
and is conducting freight operations over some trackage owned by Amtrak or by
New Jersey Transit, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority,
Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company and Maryland DOT.
 
Finally, passenger operations are
conducted either by Amtrak or by the commuter agencies over trackage owned by
Conrail in the Shared Assets Areas.

NONCARRIER
OPERATIONS -

NS' noncarrier
subsidiaries engage principally in the
 acquisition, leasing and
management of coal, oil, gas and minerals; the development of commercial real
estate; telecommunications; and the leasing or sale of rail property and
equipment.
 
In 2005, no such
noncarrier subsidiary or industry segment grouping of noncarrier subsidiaries met
the requirements for a reportable
business
segment set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131.

RAILWAY PROPERTY

The NS railroad system
extends across 22 states, the
District of Columbia
 and portions of
Canada
..
 
The

railroad infrastructure makes the company capital intensive with total property
of approximately $21 billion.

Capital
Expenditures -

Capital expenditures for road, equipment and other property for the past five
years were as follows (including capitalized leases):

ability to provide safe, efficient and reliable transportation services.
 
For 2006, NS has budgeted $1.15 billion
of capital spending.
 
On
Dec. 2, 2005
, NS announced an agreement to form a joint venture
with
Kansas City
 Southern pursuant to which NS intends to contribute
$300 million in cash in exchange for a 30% interest in the joint venture.
 
See the discussion following “Cash
used for investing activities,” in Part II, Item 7,
“Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.”

Ongoing
freight car and locomotive maintenance programs are intended to ensure the
highest standards of safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and equipment
marketability.
 
The freight car bad
order ratio rose in 2001 and 2002 as a result of decreased maintenance
activity.
 
The declines in 2005 and
2003 reflected an increase in maintenance activity as well as the retirement of
unserviceable units.
 
The locomotive
bad order ratio includes units out of service for required inspections every 92
days and program work such as overhauls.
 

The elevated ratio through 2005 reflected units out of service related
to the resumption of maintenance and modification activities.

Encumbrances
- -

Certain
railroad equipment is subject to the prior lien of equipment financing
obligations amounting to approximately $650 million as of
Dec. 31, 2005
, and $930 million as of
Dec. 31, 2004
..

Track
Maintenance -

Of the approximately 38,000 total miles of track operated, NS had
responsibility for maintaining about 30,000 miles of track with the remainder
being operated under trackage rights.

Over
75% of the main line trackage (including first, second, third and branch main
tracks, all excluding trackage rights) has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds
per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard.
 
Approximately 44% of NS lines carried 20
million or more gross tons per track mile.

Microwave
System -

The NS microwave system, consisting of approximately 7,400 radio
route miles, 424 core stations, 14 secondary stations and 5 passive
repeater stations, provides communications between most operating
locations.
 
The microwave system is
used primarily for voice communications, VHF radio control circuits, data and
facsimile transmissions, traffic control operations and AEI data transmissions.

Traffic
Control -

Of the approximately 16,200 route miles owned by NS, 11,052 miles are
signalized, including 8,030 miles of centralized traffic control (CTC) and 3,022 miles
of automatic block signals.
 

Of the 8,030 miles of CTC, 2,715 miles are controlled by data radio
originating at 215 base station radio sites.

Computers -

A computer network
consisting of a centralized data center in
Atlanta
,
Georgia
, and various distributed
computers throughout the company connects the yards, terminals, transportation
offices, rolling stock repair points, sales offices and other key system locations.
 
Operating and traffic data are processed
and stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout
the system.
 
Computer systems
provide current information on the location of every train and each car on
line, as well as related waybill and other train and car movement data.
 
In addition, the computer systems are
utilized to assist management in the performance of a variety of functions and
services including payroll, car and revenue accounting, billing, material
management activities and controls, and special studies.

ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS -

Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the
protection of the environment is a principal NS goal.
 
To date, such compliance has not
affected materially NS' capital additions, earnings, liquidity or competitive
position.
 
See the discussion of
“Personal Injury, Environmental and Legal Liabilities” in
Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in Note 18 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

with 14 different labor unions.
 

See the discussion of “Labor Agreements” in Part II,
Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.”

GOVERNMENT
REGULATION -

In addition to environmental, safety, securities and other
regulations generally applicable to all businesses, NS' railroads are subject
to regulation by the STB.
 
The STB
has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, conditions of service and the
extension or abandonment of rail lines.
 

The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger or
acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers.
 
The Federal Railroad Administration regulates
certain track and mechanical equipment standards.

The
relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, begun over two decades ago
under the Staggers Rail  Act of 1980, has continued.
 
Significant exemptions are TOFC/COFC
(i.e., “piggyback”) business, rail boxcar traffic, lumber,
manufactured steel, automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand,
gravel, pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing.
 
Transportation contracts on regulated
shipments effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well for the
duration of the contract.
 
About 80%
of NS' freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under
transportation contracts.

Efforts
may be made in 2006 to re-subject the rail industry to unwarranted federal
economic regulation.
 
The Staggers
Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and
enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business, thereby
contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of
the industry.
 
Accordingly, NS will
oppose efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation.

COMPETITION -

There is continuing
strong competition among rail, water and highway carriers.
 
Price is usually only one factor of
importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific
hauling company.
 
Inventory carrying
costs, service reliability, ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and
damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for
higher-valued finished goods, machinery and consumer products.
 
Even for raw materials, semifinished
goods and work-in-process, users are increasingly sensitive to transport
arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.

NS'
primary rail competitor is the CSX system; both operate throughout much of the
same territory.
 
Other railroads also
operate in parts of the territory.
 

NS also competes with motor carriers, water carriers and with shippers
who have the additional option of handling their own goods in private carriage.

Certain
marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers
enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets.

Item 1A.
 
Risk Factors.

NS
is subject to significant governmental regulation and legislation over
commercial, environmental and operating matters.

Railroads are subject to commercial regulation by the Surface
Transportation Board, which has jurisdiction over some rates, routes,
conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.
 
The STB also has jurisdiction over the
consolidation, merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common
carriers.
 
Occasional efforts are
made to re-subject the rail industry to unwarranted federal economic
regulation.
 
Economic re-regulation
of the rail industry could negatively impact NS’ ability to determine
prices for rail services and reduce capital spending on its rail network,
resulting in a material adverse effect on NS’ results of operations,
financial condition, and liquidity.

NS’
operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental
laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air;
discharges to water ways or ground water supplies; handling, storage,
transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and the cleanup of
hazardous material or petroleum releases. The risk of incurring environmental
liability - for acts and omissions, past, present and future - is inherent in
the railroad business.  Several of NS’ subsidiaries own, or have
owned, land used as operating property or held for sale, or which is leased or
may have been leased and operated by others.  Environmental problems that
are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, and NS could incur
environmental liabilities or costs, the amount and materiality of which cannot
be estimated reliably at this time, with respect to one or more of these
properties.  Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified
environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time, and the
resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

The Federal Railroad Administration regulates a host of operations
matters including track and mechanical equipment standards; signaling systems;
testing and inspection of grade crossing warning devices, hours of service of
operating employees; drug and alcohol testing; locomotive engineer
certification; and reporting of employee injuries, among other areas.
 
NS’ unintentional failure to
comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse
effect on NS, and changes in the legislative or regulatory frameworks within
which NS operates could adversely affect its business.

NS
may be affected by general economic conditions.

Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic
conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities NS carries
may have an adverse effect on its operating results, financial condition, and
liquidity.
 
Economic conditions
resulting in bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a
significant impact in a particular quarter.

NS
faces competition from other transportation providers.

NS is subject to competition from motor carriers, railroads, and
to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and pipelines on the basis of transit time,
pricing, and the quality and reliability of service.
 
While NS has used primarily internal
resources to build or acquire and maintain its rail system, trucks and barges
have been able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any
future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or
reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in
which NS operates, or legislation granting materially greater latitude for
motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations, could have a
material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition, and
liquidity.

NS, as a common carrier by rail, must
offer to transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk.

Transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic
losses in terms of personal injury and property damage costs, and compromise
critical parts of our rail network.
 

Legislation introduced in Congress in early 2005 would give federal regulators
increased authority to conduct investigations and levy substantial fines and
penalties in connection with railroad accidents.
 
Federal regulators also would be
required to prescribe new regulations governing railroads’ transportation
of hazardous materials.
 
If enacted,
such legislation and regulations could impose significant additional costs on
railroads.
 
Additionally,
regulations adopted by t
he Department of
Transportation and regulations contemplated by the Department of
Home
land Security could significantly increase
the costs associated with moving hazardous materials on NS’ lines.
 
Further,
certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous
materials moving by rail within their borders.
 
Some legislators have contemplated
pre-notification requirements for hazardous materials shipments.
 
If promulgated such ordinances could
require the re-routing of hazardous materials shipments, with the potential for
significant additional costs and network inefficiencies.

The operations of carriers
with which NS interchanges may adversely affect its operations.

NS’ ability to provide rail service to customers in the
U.S.
 and
Canada
 depends in large part upon its ability to
maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to,
among other matters, freight rates, revenue divisions, car supply, reciprocal
switching, interchange, trackage rights and locomotive availability.
 
Deterioration in the operations of, or
service provided by connecting carriers, or in our relationship with those
connecting carriers,
could result in NS’
inability to meet its customers’ demands or require NS to use alternate
train routes, which could result in significant additional costs and network
inefficiencies.

NS
relies on technology and technology improvements in its business operations.

If NS experiences significant disruption or failure of one or more
of its information technology systems, including computer hardware, software,
and communications equipment, NS could experience a service interruption,
security breach, or other operational difficulties, which could have a material
adverse impact on its results of operations, financial condition, and
liquidity.
 
Additionally, if NS does
not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if it is unable to
implement new technology, NS may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the
rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation
service, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations,
financial position, and liquidity.

During 2006, NS will relocate its primary production
data center to a newly renovated, state-of-the-art data center. Relocation of
primary production applications will begin in April and continue through
November. Multiple strategies are being utilized to minimize risk such as
purchasing seed equipment for the new data center in
support
 of all mission critical applications. This would
include all network components, Mainframe, Teradata and server based critical
infrastructure. For less critical applications, the equipment will be shutdown
and transported to the new data center. In all cases disaster recovery
readiness for mission critical applications will be maintained.

The
vast majority of NS employees belong to labor unions, and labor agreements,
strikes, or work stoppages could adversely affect its operations.

A
pproximately 26,000, or
about 85%, of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining
agreements with various labor unions. 
If
unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown,
NS could experience a significant disruption of its operations.
 
Additionally, future national labor
agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor
agreements, could significantly increase NS’ costs for healthcare, wages,
and other benefits.
 
Any of these
factors could have a material adverse impact on NS’ results of
operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

NS
may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant
expenditures.

The nature of NS’ business exposes it
to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and
employment, personal injury, freight loss and other property damage, and other
matters.
Job-related personal injury and
occupational claims are subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act
(FELA), which is applicable only to railroads.   FELA’s fault-based
tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as
compared with a no-fault worker’s compensation system.
 
The variability inherent in this system
could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded.

Any material changes to current litigation trends or a
catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss or property
damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could have a material
adverse effect on NS’ operating results, financial condition, and
liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance.
 
NS has obtained commercial insurance for
potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property
damages.
 
Specified levels of risk
are retained on a self-insurance basis (currently up to $25 million per
occurrence for bodily injury and property damage to third parties and $12.5 million
per occurrence for property owned by NS or in its care, custody or
control).
 
Insurance is available
from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if
available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to NS.

Severe weather could result
in significant business interruptions and expenditures.

Severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including
hurricanes and floods, may cause significant business interruptions and result
in increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues, which could
have an adverse effect on NS’ operating results, financial condition, and
liquidity.

Unpredictability
of demand for rail services resulting in the unavailability of qualified
personnel could adversely affect NS’ operational efficiency and ability
to meet demand.

Workforce demographics, training
requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel, particularly
engineers and trainmen, could each have a negative impact on NS’ ability
to meet demand for rail service. Unpredictable increases in demand for rail
services may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on NS’
operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on its
results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

NS
may be affected by terrorism or war.

Any terrorist
attack, or other similar event, any government response thereto, and war or
risk of war could cause significant business interruption and may adversely
affect NS’ results of operations, financial condition, and
liquidity.
 
Because NS plays a
critical role in the nation’s transportation system, it could become the
target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government’s
preemptive approach or response to an attack or war.

Although NS currently maintains insurance coverage for third-party
liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism, its current insurance
coverage for first-party property damage and damage to property in NS’
care, custody or control does not apply to damage caused by war and may not
apply to certain acts of terrorism.
 

In addition, premiums for some or all of NS’ current insurance
programs covering these losses could increase dramatically, or insurance
coverage for certain losses may not be available to NS in the future.

NS may be affected by supply
constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of
some of its supplier markets.

NS

consumes over 500 million gallons of diesel fuel each year.
 
Fuel availability could be affected by
any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation
or rationing regulations.
 
If a
severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments, disruption of
oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or
pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or otherwise, NS’
operating results, financial condition, and liquidity could be affected.
 
Also, such an event would impact NS as
well as its customers and other transportation companies.

Due to the capital intensive nature and industry-specific
requirements of the rail industry, there are high barriers of entry for
potential new suppliers of core railroad items, such as locomotives and rolling
stock equipment.
 
Additionally, NS
competes with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in
the production of certain track materials, such as rail and ties.
 
Changes in the competitive landscapes of
these limited-supplier markets could result in increased prices or material
shortages that could materially affect NS’ operating results, financial
condition, and liquidity.

Management's Discussion and
Analysis of

Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and the Selected Financial Data.

OVERVIEW

NS’ results in 2005
reflect substantial increases in revenues resulting from higher pricing, fuel
surcharges and increased traffic volume that kept pace with the growth of the
U.S.
 economy.
 

Revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 17%, in 2005, as high demand for
rail freight transportation, coupled with constrained capacity for other modes
of transport and the fluidity of the NS network enabled NS to raise rates and
handle additional volume.
 

Approximately one-third of the revenue increase was due to higher fuel
surcharge amounts.
 
Carloadings were
up 322,300 units, or 4%, largely because of a 9% increase in intermodal
traffic.
 
For the most part,
increased operating expenses of $800 million were reflective of the increased
traffic volume as well as sharply higher fuel prices.
 
In addition, casualties and other claims
expenses were significantly higher in 2005 related to an accident in
Graniteville
,
South
  Carolina
 in
January, a large unfavorable jury award in July and two strong
Gulf
Coast
 hurricanes in August and September.
 
Despite the 14% increase in expenses,
the operating ratio, a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by
operating expenses, improved to 75.2%, and income from railway operations rose
24%.

The strong operating results
translated into significantly improved cash flows which were used to pay off
debt and increase dividends while establishing an all-time high cash and
short-term investment balance of $1.3 billion at year end.
 
Looking ahead, NS expects business
levels to continue to grow in 2006 but at a more modest pace than seen in
2005.
 
NS plans to continue its
focus on improving service levels and maintaining an aggressive pricing
strategy as business is renewed.
 

Approximately one-half of NS’ revenue base is subject to
renegotiation or repricing in 2006.

SUMMARIZED
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2005 Compared with 2004

Net income in 2005 was $1.3
billion, or $3.11 per diluted share, up $358 million, or 39%, compared with
$923 million, or $2.31 per diluted share, in 2004.
 
The results in 2005 reflected a $96
million second quarter increase to net income related to state tax law changes
(see Note 3), while the results in 2004 reflected a $53 million net gain
related to the Conrail Corporate Reorganization (see Note 5).
 
The remaining $315 million increase in
net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations.
 
Railway operating revenues increased
$1.2 billion, reflecting higher rates (including the favorable effects of the
coal rate cases settled in the second quarter – see below), fuel
surcharges and increased traffic volume.
 

Railway operating expenses rose $800 million, or 14%, principally due to
higher diesel fuel prices, increased volume-related expenses and casualty
claims costs.

2004 Compared with 2003

Net income in 2004 of $923
million, or $2.31 per diluted share, was up $388 million, or 73%, compared with
net income of $535 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, in 2003.
 
Results in 2003 included a
$10 million, or 3 cents per share, gain from discontinued operations
(see Note 17) and a $114 million, or 29 cents per share, benefit related
to the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles (see
Note 1).
 
Income from
continuing operations before accounting changes was $923 million, or $2.31 per
diluted share, in 2004, compared with $411 million, or $1.05 per diluted share,
in 2003.
 
The increase in 2004 was
the result of higher income from railway operations and also included a $53
million net noncash gain from the Conrail Corporate Reorganization (see Note
5).
 
In addition, the comparisons
were affected by the costs of a voluntary separation program (see Note 11) and
the impairment of certain telecommunications assets (see Note 6) in 2003, which
combined to reduce net income in that year by $119 million, or 30 cents per
diluted share.

In
2005, revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 17%, reflecting a $539 million, or
13%, rise in general merchandise revenues; a $387 million, or 22%, improvement
in coal revenues; and a $289 million, or 19%, increase in intermodal
revenues.
 
All market groups
collected significant amounts of fuel surcharge, which accounted for
approximately one-third of the increase in revenues.
 
At year end 2005, fuel surcharge
provisions covered approximately 85% of total revenues.

As
shown in the following table, the 2005 revenue improvement was the result of
increased average revenues and higher traffic volumes.

The
favorable revenue per unit/mix variance accounted for 74% of the total variance
and was driven by higher rates and increased fuel surcharges, offset in part by
an unfavorable mix component reflecting a 9% rise in lower average priced
intermodal traffic volume.
 
Volume
rose by 322,300 units, or 4%.

In
2004, revenues increased $844 million, or 13%, reflecting a $318 million, or
9%, rise in general merchandise revenues, a $298 million, or 24%, increase in
intermodal revenues and a $228 million, or 15%, improvement in coal
revenues.
 
The revenue improvement
was the result of 9% higher traffic volumes and increased average
revenues.
 
All general merchandise
market groups except automotive posted volume increases over 2003.
 
The favorable revenue per unit/mix
variance was driven by higher average revenue per unit that reflected higher
rates and increased fuel surcharges, offset in part by the effects of a 17%
increase in lower-priced intermodal traffic volume.

Beginning

March 1, 2004
, NS modified its fuel
surcharge program for its merchandise and coal traffic.
 
The fuel surcharge program in effect
until that time applied a 2% fuel surcharge to line haul freight charges when
the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price, as published in the Wall
Street Journal, exceeded $28.00 per barrel for 30 consecutive business days.
 
For each $5.00 per barrel increase, an
additional 2% fuel surcharge applied.
 

The revised fuel surcharge is based on the monthly average price of WTI
crude oil.
 
Line haul freight
charges are adjusted by 0.4% for every dollar the average price exceeds $23 per
barrel in the second calendar month prior to the month in which the fuel
surcharge is applied.
 
The
modification in the fuel surcharge program causes the amount charged to more
closely reflect fuel price fluctuations.
 

Higher average WTI crude oil prices resulted in an increase in fuel
surcharges; however, this was offset by the effect of higher prices for diesel
fuel and other oil products.

COAL

revenues increased $387 million, or 22%, compared
with 2004, reflecting higher average revenue per carload and increased traffic
volume.
 
Coal average revenue per
unit was up 19% compared with 2004, reflecting higher rates, the favorable
effects of fuel surcharges, longer-haul business and the rate cases settled in
the second quarter (see below).
 

Coal represented 25% of NS’ revenues in 2005, and 83% of shipments
handled originated on NS’ lines.
 

Traffic volumes rose 3% primarily because of increased shipments of
utility coal that offset lower export and domestic metallurgical coal, coke and
iron ore shipments.

During the second quarter of
2005, NS entered into settlement agreements with two utility customers that
resolved their rail transportation rate cases before the Surface Transportation
Board (STB).
 
In 2002, Duke Energy
(Duke) and Carolina Power & Light (CP&L) each filed rate reasonableness
complaints with the STB.
 
In October
2004, the STB found NS’ rates to be reasonable in both cases, and at the
STB’s invitation, Duke and CP&L each initiated proceedings to
determine if phasing constraints should apply.
 
As a result of the settlement of these
cases, NS recognized $55 million of additional coal revenue related to the
period in dispute.

In 2004, coal revenues
increased $228 million, or 15%, versus 2003.
 
Traffic volume increased 5% primarily
due to higher export, utility and metallurgical coal volumes, which offset
declines in coke and iron ore.
 

Average revenue per unit increased 10%, reflecting higher rates, fuel
surcharges, a favorable change in the mix of traffic (the rate of increase
in longer haul traffic exceeded that of short haul traffic) and improved
loading productivity (increased tons per car).
 
Coal, coke and iron ore revenues
represented 24% of total railway operating revenues in 2004, and 83% of NS' coal
shipments originated on lines it operates.

Utility
coal

volume
increased 6%, compared to 2004, in response to increased coal-fired generation
to meet the heavier electricity demand of a strong economy, limited nuclear
power generation capacity, higher natural gas prices and utility coal
stockpiles which were below target levels across NS’ service area.
 
Supply constraints dampened shipments
while the increased demand for
Eastern U.S.
 coal prompted some
customers to shift to coal from non-traditional sources in
Wyoming
 and
Colorado
 and imported coal.
 
Appalachian coal production increased
modestly and western coal production was up 2% in 2005.

In 2004, utility coal
 volume increased 3%, compared to 2003, as
electricity production was up almost 2% in NS’ service region responding
to higher demand driven by a rebounding
U.S.
 economy.
 
Utilities increased burn to meet the
heavier electricity demand and a new rail unloading facility began operating in
April 2004 at a northern utility.
 

Utility coal stockpiles were below target levels across NS’
service area due in part to the increased demand for coal-fired electric
generation.
 
Increased demand for
Eastern U.S.
 coal prompted some
customers to shift to coal from non-traditional sources in
Wyoming
 and
Colorado
 in addition to more
imported coal.
 
In response,
Appalachian coal production increased slightly in 2004 following a decline in
2003.

The
outlook for utility coal remains positive.
 

The continued growth in demand for electricity and lower-than-targeted
coal stockpiles at the utilities should
support
 increased coal carloads in
2006.
 
Domestic western origin and
imported coals are expected to continue to be an important source of additional
coal supply to overcome the supply imbalance created by increased utility
demand and the supply constraints of
Eastern U.S.
 coal sources.
 
Natural gas prices are expected to
remain higher and more volatile than coal energy prices.
 
As always, demand for coal will be
influenced by the weather.

A
number of evolving environmental issues could affect the utility coal market,
depending upon their outcome.
 
These
include a national energy policy, proposed multi-emissions legislation, mercury
emissions standards, new source review, potential regional programs aimed at
capping and reducing power plant CO


emissions, and ongoing
efforts at addressing climate change.
 

Certain utilities have chosen to add emissions control technologies to
their electric generating units in advance of governmental requirements and are
moving up their plans to more fully utilize their existing coal-fired power
plants.

Export coal

volume decreased 11% in
2005, compared to 2004, due to both coal supply constraints and a weak European
steel market.
 
Volume through
Norfolk
 and
Baltimore
 decreased.
 
Norfolk
 was down approximately
16,000 carloads, or 14%, and
Baltimore
 was down approximately 2,000 carloads,
or 6%.
 
U.S. exports in 2005 were
constrained by several factors:
 
(1)
the tight coal supply from Eastern coal mines caused primarily by the sporadic
closure of a major coal mine, (2) the idling of production by European
steel manufacturers in order to manage finished goods inventory, and (3) the abundant
supply of Chinese coke on the world market lowering the price and making it
more economical to buy coke rather than import metallurgical coal from the U.S.
and convert it.

In
2004, export coal volume increased 35%, compared to 2003, due to sustained
strong global demand for high quality metallurgical coal and
China
’s continued growing
consumption of coal for steel production and electricity generation.
 
The devaluation of the dollar resulted
in lower
U.S.
 coal prices relative to
Australian and Canadian coal prices, which made
U.S.
 coals more economical in
traditional European markets.
 
In
addition, ocean vessel rates continued to favor
U.S.
 coals.
 
Volume through
Baltimore
 and
Norfolk
 increased
dramatically.
 
Baltimore
 was up approximately
24,000 carloads, or 159%, and
Norfolk
 was up approximately 16,000
carloads, or 16%.
 
However,
U.S.
 exports in 2004 were
constrained by the tight coal supply from Eastern coal mines.

Export
coal volume for 2006 is expected to show improvement, subject to the
availability of
U.S.
 coal, as the European steel
market recovers; and international demand for high-quality metallurgical coal
is expected to remain high despite the impact of abundant Chinese coke on the
world market.

Domestic
metallurgical

coal, coke and iron ore volume was down 2% in 2005, compared
with 2004.
 
Declines in
domestic coke and iron ore volumes, principally due to the idling of a major
steel blast furnace, were partially offset by an 8% increase in metallurgical
coal.

For 2004, domestic metallurgical
 coal, coke and iron ore
volume was flat compared with 2003.
 

Metallurgical coal volume was up 12%.
 
However, this was offset by declines in
domestic coke and iron ore volumes, principally due to reduced production at an
NS-served producer.

Demand
for domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore is expected to improve in
2006, as the idled blast furnace is expected to return to operation and
metallurgical coal production is expected to grow.

Other
coal

volumes (principally steam coal shipped to industrial plants) decreased 3%
versus 2004, primarily due to the diversion of coal to the utility market.
 
In 2004, other coal volumes increased 2%
versus 2003, primarily due to new business and the recovery of the
U.S.
 economy.

GENERAL
MERCHANDISE

revenues increased 13% due to higher average rates and fuel surcharges.
 
Traffic volume was up modestly compared
with 2004 as decreases in automotive and chemicals traffic offset increases in
other business groups.
 
In 2004,
general merchandise revenues increased 9% and traffic volume increased 4%
compared to 2003, principally due to higher average revenues across all
business groups, including increased fuel surcharges, and improved volumes in
all but the automotive business group.

Automotive

revenues rose 5% in 2005
compared with 2004, the result of an 8% increase in average revenue per unit
that reflected pricing improvements and higher fuel surcharges.
 
In contrast, traffic volume decreased 3%
primarily due to reduced production at Ford and GM, with GM closing assembly
plants in
Michigan
,
Maryland
 and
New Jersey
..
 
Ford and GM combined operate 17 of 31
assembly plants served by NS.
 
These
declines were partially offset by increased production at Honda, Mercedes-Benz
and
Toyota
..

In
2004, automotive revenues increased 2%, reflecting pricing improvements and
fuel surcharge increases.
 
In
contrast, traffic volume decreased 2% compared to 2003, primarily related to
reduced automotive production at Ford and GM, partially offset by increased
production at Toyota and Honda.

For
2006, automotive revenues are expected to increase modestly despite a continued
decline in traffic volume.
 
Production
decreases by
U.S.
 automotive manufacturers are
expected to be partially offset by higher domestic production by foreign
manufacturers.
 
In addition to the
GM plant closures that occurred in 2005, Ford announced that it will close five
plants, of which NS serves the
St. Louis
 and
Atlanta
 assembly plants and the
Batavia
 transmission plant.

Metals
and construction

revenue increased 20% and traffic volume increased 2% in 2005 compared
with 2004.
 
Revenue per unit rose
17% because of higher rates and fuel surcharges.
 
The volume improvements were due
primarily to continued strength at NS-served integrated and electric arc mills
and higher aluminum product shipments, which were partially offset by lower
scrap metal carloads.
 
Construction
traffic volume benefited from increased residential, commercial and highway
construction.

For 2004, metals and construction
 revenue increased 17% and
traffic volume increased 10% compared with 2003.
 
The improvement was primarily due to
increased production at NS-served integrated mills and mini-mills, the
conversion of truck business to rail resulting from a shortage of flatbed
trucks as well as higher scrap metal volumes resulting from expanded alliances
with key scrap metal shippers and access to new scrap processors and steel
mills.
 
Construction traffic volume
benefited from increased residential, commercial and highway construction.

Metals
and construction volume is expected to be slightly higher in 2006, reflecting
continued strength in metals and highway construction, coupled with
reconstruction in the Gulf Coast region.

Chemicals

revenues increased 13%,
reflecting higher prices and fuel surcharges, while traffic volume was down
slightly, as a result of production curtailment in the Gulf Coast region,
compared with a strong 2004.
 
Volume
increases for plastic and petroleum products were offset by decreases in
industrial and miscellaneous chemicals.

In 2004, chemicals
 revenues increased 12% and traffic volume
increased 5% compared with 2003.
 

Revenue per unit reflected higher prices in response to market
conditions and fuel surcharges.
 
The
volume increase reflected manufacturers’ increased demand across all
chemical business groups.
 

Feedstocks and plastic shipments were up as inventories were restocked
in anticipation of higher product prices related to increased natural gas costs,
and new propane and asphalt terminals in the Southeast added carloads.

Chemical
volume is expected to grow modestly in 2006,
support
ed by new and expanded
propane and plastic plants in
North Carolina
 and
Virginia
..
 
However, volume could be adversely
affected by the price of natural gas and crude oil, which accounts for more
than 50% of the cost of most chemical products and presents a significant
competitive challenge that could cause domestic chemical producers to move
production overseas.

Agriculture,
consumer products and government

revenue increased 16% and traffic volume increased
2% in 2005 compared with 2004.
 

Average revenue per unit rose 14%, a result of higher rates and fuel
surcharges.
 
Traffic volume growth
resulted from sweeteners, government traffic and fertilizer.
 
Government traffic growth was primarily
due to the
support
 of military operations in
Iraq
 as well as shipments of
temporary housing to hurricane-damaged areas.
 
Ethanol traffic increased 38% due to
higher shipments from current customers in addition to new business in
Georgia
 and
South Carolina
..

In 2004, agriculture, consumer products and
government

revenue increased 6% and traffic volume increased 2% compared with 2003.
 
Revenue per unit improved 3% as a result
of changes in traffic mix such as increased ethanol traffic and more long haul
feed shipments as well as higher prices.
 

The volume increase was primarily driven by ethanol and fertilizer
shipments.
 
Ethanol traffic
increased 59% primarily due to the opening of the Northeast market to ethanol
as a gasoline additive.
 
Fertilizer
was up 7% year-over-year, reflecting higher domestic shipments to industrial
customers and increased exports of phosphates, principally to
China
..

Agriculture,
consumer products and government volume is expected to grow in 2006, benefiting
from the expanding markets for ethanol and bio-diesel production and continued
recovery efforts in the Gulf region.

Paper,
clay and forest products

revenue increased 16% and traffic volume increased 2% in 2005 compared
with 2004.
 
Average revenue per unit
rose 13% due to higher rates and fuel surcharges.
 
Pulp board, printing paper, newsprint
and woodchip produced volume gains despite consolidations within the industry
and mill shutdowns.

In 2004, paper, clay and forest products
 revenue increased 8% and
traffic volume increased 1% compared with 2003, reflecting yield improvements
in all segments except newsprint, together with higher printing paper,
newsprint, pulp board and kaolin shipments as U.S. paper production and demand
for paper products strengthened in 2004.
 

Revenue per unit improved 6% principally as a result of price increases
but also aided by higher fuel surcharges.

In
2006, paper, clay and forest product revenues are expected to benefit from paper
volume, higher construction and demolition debris shipments and a new lumber
distribution center that is expected to open in 2006.

INTERMODAL

revenues increased $289 million, or 19% compared with
2004, reflecting improved traffic volume, higher fuel surcharges, and increased
rates.
 
Despite moderated growth in
domestic business, traffic volume increased 9% reflecting
strength in the international, truckload and
Triple Crown Services lines of business
..
 
International
traffic volume grew by 16% reflecting strength in
U.S.
 consumer markets and growth
in the movement of import and export goods through NS-served east coast ports,
as well as west coast ports.
 
Truckload
volume increased 10% compared with 2004, reflecting additional business with
traditional truckload companies.
 

Premium business, which includes parcel and LTL carriers, grew 6% due
primarily to new business in the Northern region.
 
Triple Crown Services volume grew 6%
reflecting expanded geographic coverage and increased trailer fleet size to
meet higher demand.
 
Domestic volume
decreased 3% compared with 2004, principally due to the continued reduction in
transloading of west coast international freight into domestic containers.
 
Intermodal
revenue per unit increased 9%, a result of fuel surcharges and rate
increases.

In 2004, intermodal
 revenue increased 24% and volume increased
17% compared with 2003.
 
Strong
demand was driven by an expanding economy led by higher consumer spending,
industrial production and international trade, in addition to constraints in
truck and other railroads’ capacity.
 

International steamship volume was up 15%, tied to the growth in
U.S.
 trade volumes through east
and west coast ports.
 
Truckload
volume increased 28% as a result of new business with traditional truckload
companies.
 
Premium business, which
includes parcel and LTL carriers, grew 15% principally due to new parcel
service between
Chicago
 and
New Jersey
..
 
Triple Crown Services Company increased
volume by 8% through an expanded trailer fleet and growth in its geographic
coverage.
 
Revenue per unit improved
6%, reflecting value-based pricing and fuel surcharges.

In
2006, intermodal revenues are expected to grow as NS plans to open new terminals
in
Kentucky
 and
Pennsylvania
 in addition to expanding
existing intermodal terminals in
Georgia
 and
Ohio
..
 
In addition, strong international trade
is expected to create growth opportunities in NS’ international
business segment.
 
Future growth
may, however, be tempered by operating improvements at other railroads, as
well as constraints in the drayage market.

Railway
Operating Expenses

Railway
operating expenses in 2005 were $6.4 billion, up $800 million, or 14%, compared
to 2004, which were up 4% compared to 2003.
 
The 2005 increase was principally due to
a sharp rise in the price of diesel fuel, volume-related expense increases,
more maintenance activities and higher casualty costs.
 
Carloads rose 4% in 2005 compared to
2004 and 9% in 2004 compared to 2003.
 

The increase in 2004 was largely the result of higher traffic volume,
offset in part by the absence of the $107 million cost of a voluntary
separation program incurred in 2003.

The
railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of railway operating
revenues consumed by railway operating expenses, was 75.2% in 2005, compared
with 76.7% in 2004 and 83.5% in 2003.

The
following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by
major classifications.

Compensation
and benefits

,
which represents about 40% of total railway operating expenses, increased $221
million, or 10%, compared with 2004 and was flat in 2004 compared with
2003.
 
The 2005 increase reflected
increased hours for train operations, including trainees, and equipment
maintenance (up $70 million); increased wage rates (up $46 million);
increased pension, postretirement and health and welfare benefit costs (up $43
million); higher stock-based compensation (up $22 million); and higher payroll
taxes (up $12 million).

NS
employment averaged 30,294 in 2005 compared with 28,475 in 2004 and 28,753 in
2003.
 
The increased employment has
come almost exclusively in operating department personnel to meet the increased
volume and service needs, as well as expected retirements.
 
NS continues to hire and train
additional workers in order to meet the requirements of forecasted volumes in
light of the demographics of its work force.

In
2005 and prior years, NS accounted for its stock-based compensation under
APB No. 25; however, NS will adopt SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of
2006 (see discussion under “New Accounting Pronouncement” and Note
1) which will result in higher compensation expense.
 
The expense increase will include the
effect of accelerated recognition of costs related to grants to
retirement-eligible employees.
 
Most
NS salaried employees are eligible to retire at age 55 with a reduced pension
benefit.
 
SFAS No. 123(R) requires
immediate expense recognition for the cost of grants made to such
retirement-eligible employees rather than accrual over the expected future
service period.
 
About
three-quarters of the cost of stock-based compensation granted in January 2006
will be expensed in 2006 (with almost half of the cost in the first quarter)
even though some of the components are earned over a three-year period.

In
2004, compensation expenses reflected higher volume-related train and engine
payroll expenses, up $39 million; higher wage rates, which added $37 million;
increased stock-based compensation, up $24 million; and higher management
and locomotive engineer performance-based incentive compensation, which was up
$20 million.
 
These increases were
offset by lower nonagreement workforce levels, saving $24 million, as well as
the absence of the $107 million expense of the 2003 voluntary separation
program.

The
Railroad Retirement and Survivors’ Improvement Act, which took effect
Jan. 1, 2002, allows for investment of Tier II assets in a diversified
portfolio through the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust.
 
The law also provides a mechanism for
automatic adjustment of Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall
below a four-year reserve or exceed a six-year reserve.
 
As a result, the employers’
portion of Tier II retirement payroll taxes have been reduced from 14.2% in
2003 to 13.1% in 2004 and to12.6% in 2005 and thereafter.
  
However, these savings are
expected to continue to be substantially offset by higher payroll taxes on
increased wages and a higher wage base.

Materials,
services and rents

includes costs related to items used for the maintenance of railroad
lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside
contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities
with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals.
 
This category of expenses increased $208
million, or 13% in 2005 compared to 2004 and increased 12% in 2004 compared to
2003.
 
The increase in 2005
reflected higher volume-related purchased services (up $82 million) and
higher maintenance expense (up $74 million).
 
Equipment rents rose $28 million,
reflecting higher traffic volume as well as leases from the Conrail Corporate
Reorganization (see Note 5).

The
2004 increase was the result of higher purchased services, up $100 million,
including higher costs for volume-related intermodal services such as the
lifting of containers and trailers and drayage.
 
In addition, locomotive and freight car
maintenance expenses rose $23 million, and equipment rents increased
$33 million.

Locomotive
repair costs increased in 2005 and 2004, due to more maintenance activity
related to higher usage from increased traffic volumes coupled with the age of
the fleet.
 
This level of expense is
expected to continue and may increase depending on traffic volumes.

Equipment
rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars)
owned by other railroads or private owners, less the rent paid to NS for the
use of its equipment, rose 11% in 2005 and increased 9% in 2004.
 
The increase in 2005 was principally due
to additional lease expense for a full year from the Conrail Corporate
Reorganization and increased volume-related intermodal shipments.
 
The rise in 2004 was principally
due to traffic volume (particularly intermodal shipments) and the absence of
favorable settlements that benefited 2003.

Conrail
rents and services

decreased $190 million, or 60%, in 2005 compared to 2004 and decreased
24% in 2004 compared to 2003. This item includes amounts due to CRC for
operation of the Shared Assets Areas (see Note 5).
 
The decline in both 2005 and 2004 was
primarily driven by the Conrail Corporate Reorganization, which resulted in the
consolidated reporting of individual components of Conrail equity earnings,
principally depreciation, equipment rents and interest expense (see Note 5).
 
NS’ share of equity earnings after
the Conrail Corporate Reorganization is a component of “Other
income-net” (see Note 2).

Depreciation

expense increased $176
million, or 29%, in 2005 compared to 2004 and increased 17% in 2004 compared to
2003.
 
The increases in 2005 and
2004 were primarily a result of the Conrail Corporate Reorganization (see
Note 5).
 
In addition,
substantial capital investments and improvements affected all years, resulting
in higher depreciation expense.

In
2004, NS received the results of a roadway depreciation study from an
independent firm of engineers.
 
The
results of the study, which were implemented in September 2004, prospectively
reduced depreciation expense by approximately $17 million annually.
 
In 2006, NS expects to complete an
equipment depreciation study and an analysis of the assets received in the
Conrail Corporate Reorganization.
 

The results of these items are expected to reduce depreciation expense,
making 2006 comparable with 2005.

Diesel
fuel

expenses increased 62% in 2005 compared with 2004 and increased 18% in 2004
compared with 2003.
 
Diesel fuel
expense is recorded net of hedge benefits (see “Market Risks and Hedging
Activities,” below and Note 16).
 

The increase in 2005 reflects a 43% rise in the average price per gallon
and a 2% increase in consumption.
 

The increase in 2004 reflects a 13% rise in the average price per gallon
and a 6% increase in consumption.
 

Expenses in 2005 included hedge benefits of $148 million compared
with benefits of $140 million in 2004 and $59 million in 2003.
 
NS has hedged approximately 4% of
expected 2006 diesel fuel requirements as of
Dec. 31,
,
at an average price of 89 cents per gallon.
 
No new hedges have been entered into
since May 2004.
 
Accordingly, if
diesel fuel prices remain at their current levels, or increase further, diesel
fuel expense will be higher in 2006.

Legislation
enacted in the first quarter of 2005 repeals the 4.3 cents per gallon excise
tax on railroad diesel fuel and inland waterway fuel by 2007, with the
following phased reductions in 2005 and 2006: by 1 cent per gallon from Jan. 1,
2005 through June 30, 2005; 2 cents per gallon from July 1, 2005 through Dec.
31, 2006; and by the full 4.3 cents thereafter.
 
NS consumes over 500 million gallons of
diesel fuel per year.

Casualties
and other claims

expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury,
property damage and environmental matters) increased 48% in 2005 compared to
2004 and decreased 17% in 2004 compared to 2003.
 
The increase in 2005 reflected costs
associated with a derailment in
Graniteville
,
South Carolina
 (see discussion below),
$16 million for an unfavorable jury verdict received in an FELA case, $9
million of higher insurance costs, and $4 million for the portion of the $12.5
million self-insured retention related to Hurricane Katrina expenses.
 
The decline in 2004 reflected favorable
personal injury and freight claims development and higher insurance
settlements, partially offset by increased derailment expenses.

On

Jan.
 6, 2005
, a collision in
Graniteville
,
South
  Carolina
,
between two NS trains caused the release of chlorine gas from a ruptured tank
car.
 
NS’ liability in 2005
related to this accident includes a current and long-term portion which
represents NS’ best estimate based on current facts and
circumstances.
 
The estimate
includes amounts related to business property damage and other economic
losses, personal injury and individual property damage claims as well as
third-party response costs.
 

NS’ commercial insurance policies are expected to cover
substantially all expenses related to this derailment above NS’
self-insured retention, including NS’ response costs and legal fees.
 
Accordingly, the Consolidated Balance
Sheet reflects a current and long-term receivable for estimated recoveries from
NS’ insurance carriers.
 
The $41
million expense recorded in 2005 represents NS’ retention under its
insurance policies and other uninsured costs.
 
While it is reasonable to expect that
the liability for covered losses could differ from the amount recorded, such a
change would be offset by a corresponding change in the insurance
receivable.
 
As a result, NS does
not believe that it is reasonably likely that its net loss (the difference
between the liability and future recoveries) will be materially different than
the loss recorded in 2005.
 
NS
expects at this time that insurance coverage is adequate to cover potential
claims and settlements above its self-insurance retention.

During
the third quarter, NS’ operations were adversely affected by Hurricane
Katrina, and to a lesser extent, Hurricane Rita, both of which struck the
Gulf
Coast
..
 
NS sustained damage to its facilities in
the region as a result of Hurricane Katrina but restored rail freight service
into and around
New Orleans
 in a relatively short
period of time.
 
The damage
sustained to NS facilities as a result of Hurricane Katrina did not materially
impact NS’ financial condition or results of operations and is covered by
insurance above the self-insurance retention limit.

The
largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury
costs.
 
Cases involving occupational
injuries comprised about one-third of total employee injury cases resolved and
about one-fourth of total payments made.
 

With its long-established commitment to safety, NS continues to work
actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated
costs.
 
With respect to occupational
injuries, which are not caused by a specific accident or event, but result from
a claimed exposure over time, the benefits of any existing safety initiatives
may not be realized immediately.
 

These types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees,
some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades.

The
rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job-related
accidental injury and occupational claims because of the Federal Employers'
Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads.
 
FELA’s fault-based system, which
covers employee claims for job-related injuries, produces results that are
unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault workers'
compensation system.

NS
maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential third-party
liability and property damage claims.
 

It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self-insurance (see
Note 18).
 
NS expects insurance
costs to be higher in 2006.

Other
expenses

increased 15% in 2005 compared to 2004 and 5% in 2004 compared to 2003.
 
Both 2005 and 2004 reflected higher
property and sales and use taxes.

Other
income – net

was $74 million in 2005 and $89 million in 2004, which included the
$53 million gain from the Conrail Corporate Reorganization (see Note
5).
 
Results in 2005 reflected: (1)
higher interest income (up $28 million), (2) equity in earnings of Conrail
subsequent to the Conrail Corporate Reorganization (up $26 million),
(3) additional coal royalties (up $12 million), and (4) lower interest
accruals related to tax liabilities (down $9 million).
 
These income improvements were partially
offset by more expense associated with tax credit investments (up $39 million).

In
2004, other income – net increased by $70 million, reflecting the absence
of the $84 million telecommunications assets impairment charge that burdened
2003 (see Note 6) and the gain in 2004 on the Conrail Corporate Reorganization
(see Note 5).
 
These increases
combined to more than offset expenses from an investment in a limited liability
company that owns and operates facilities that produce synthetic fuel from coal
(see Note 2).
 
The production of
synthetic fuel results in tax credits as well as expenses related to the
investments.
 
The expenses are
recorded as a component of “Other income – net,” and the tax
credits, as well as tax benefits related to the expenses, are reflected in the
provision for income taxes (see Note 3).

Income
Taxes

Income
tax expense in 2005 was $416 million for an effective rate of 25%, compared
with effective rates of 29% in 2004 and 30% in 2003.
 
The large decline in 2005 resulted from
the
Ohio
 tax legislation changes, which lowered deferred
taxes by $96 million and the effective tax rate by six percentage points (see
Note 3).

As
shown in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which sets forth a
reconciliation from the statutory rate to the effective rate for all three
years, the effective rates in both 2005 and 2004 were reduced as a result of
tax credits from synthetic fuel-related investments.
 
In addition, 2004 benefited from the
favorable resolution of an IRS audit of a synthetic fuel related
investment.
 
The effective rates in
all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year
tax
returns
 and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities.

The consolidated federal
income tax
returns
 for 2002 through 2003 are being audited by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
 
The
IRS completed its examination of the 2000 and 2001 consolidated federal income
tax
returns
 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report in
September 2005, which had a negligible effect on the effective tax rate.

For the 2001 through 2004 tax
years
, 30% and
50% bonus depreciation was allowed for federal income tax purposes.
 
Except
for certain areas affected by Hurricane Katrina, bonus depreciation was not available
in 2005.
 
In addition, the Conrail
Corporate Reorganization resulted in NS receiving assets with less future tax
depreciation than book depreciation.
 

As a result,
current taxes were
higher in 2005 than in earlier years and are expected to remain higher in 2006
..

NS’ interests in
synthetic fuel credits are subject to reduction if the Reference Price of a
barrel of oil for the year falls within an inflation-adjusted phase-out range
specified by the tax code.
 
The Reference Price for a year is the annual average
wellhead price per barrel of unregulated domestic crude oil as determined by
the Secretary of the Treasury by April 1 of the following year. In 2004, the
phase-out range was $51.35 to $64.47.
 

The phase-out range for 2005 and later years will be adjusted for
inflation.
 
No phase out is
considered likely in 2005; however, NS cannot predict with certainty the
Reference Price of a barrel of oil for later years.
 
If the Reference Price for a year falls
within or exceeds the applicable phase-out range for that year, NS’
synthetic fuel credits could be reduced or eliminated. However, indemnification
arrangements limit NS’ exposure if tax credits are reduced due to oil
prices.

Discontinued
Operations

In 2003, income from discontinued operations consisted
of a $10 million after-tax gain related to the resolution of tax issues arising
from the sale of NS’ motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17).

FINANCIAL
CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash provided by operating activities,

NS' principal source of
liquidity, was $2.1 billion in 2005, compared with $1.7 billion in 2004 and
$1.1 billion in 2003.
 
The
improvement in 2005 reflected the $415 million increase in income from railway
operations as well as the effects of the Conrail Corporate Reorganization (see
below), offset in part by higher income tax payments, including a payment made
upon settlement of a federal audit cycle.
 

In 2004, the increase was primarily due to increased railway operating
income.

Prior to the Conrail Corporate Reorganization (see
Note 5), a significant portion of the payments made to PRR under the operating
and lease agreements (which were included in “Conrail rents and
services” and, therefore, were a use of cash in “Cash provided by
operating activities”), was borrowed back from a subsidiary of PRR under
a note due in 2032, and therefore, was a source of cash in “Proceeds from
borrowings.”
 
NS’ net
cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $118 million in 2004 and
$203 million in 2003.
 
This
note was effectively extinguished by the reorganization in 2004.
 
Subsequent to the Conrail Corporate
Reorganization, payments under “Conrail rents and services” have
declined, depreciation charges have increased and the net borrowings have been
terminated.
 
Accordingly, NS’
cash provided by operating activities after the Conrail Corporate
Reorganization has increased.

NS had working capital of $729 million at
Dec. 31, 2005
, compared with a working capital deficit of $234 million at
Dec. 31, 2004
..
 
The improvement reflected
higher cash provided by operating activities, as well as a $348 million
reduction in current maturities of long-term debt.
 
NS expects that cash on hand combined
with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its ongoing
obligations.
 
This expectation is
based on a view that the economy will continue at a moderate growth rate
through 2006.

Contractual
obligations

at Dec. 31, 2005, related to NS' long-term debt (including capital leases) (see
Note 8), operating leases (see Note 9), agreements with CRC (see Note 5),
unconditional purchase obligations (see Note 18) and other long-term
obligations (see Note 18), are as follows:

NS did not renew its accounts receivable
securitization program which expired in May 2005.

Cash used for investing activities

was $1.8 billion in 2005,
compared with $1.2 billion in 2004 and $640 million in 2003.
 
The increase in 2005 was principally the
result of larger purchases of short-term investments, while the rise in 2004
resulted from higher property additions
and the investment in a membership interest in a
limited liability company that owns and operates facilities that produce
synthetic fuel from coal.
 
Property
additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category.

spending (including capital leases) and track and equipment statistics for the

Capital expenditures in 2005 were $16 million, or
2%, lower than 2004 principally due to decreases in equipment purchases that
were partially offset by increased investment in roadway projects.
 
In 2004, h
igher capital expenditures were primarily due
to increased locomotive purchases as well as investment in roadway projects,
Triple Crown Services equipment and freight cars.

Through
its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about
29,000 hopper cars into high-capacity steel gondolas or hoppers.
 
As a result, the remaining service life
of the freight-car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing
average age shown in the table above.

For
2006, NS has budgeted $1.15 billion for capital expenditures.
 
The anticipated spending includes $735
million for roadway projects, of which $484 million is for track and bridge
program work.
 
Also included are
projects for communications, signal and electrical systems, as well as projects
for environmental and public improvements such as grade crossing separations
and signal upgrades.
 
Other roadway
projects include marketing and industrial development initiatives, including
increasing track capacity and access to coal receivers and vehicle production
and distribution facilities, and continuing investments in intermodal
infrastructure.
 
Equipment spending
of $358 million includes the purchase of 133 locomotives and upgrades to
existing units, improvements to multilevel automobile racks, and projects
related to computers and information technology, including additional security
and backup systems.
 
NS expects to
make all of its capital expenditures with internally generated funds.

On
Dec. 2, 2005
, NS announced an agreement
to form a joint venture with
Kansas City
 Southern pursuant to which
NS intends to contribute $300 million in cash, substantially all of which will
be used for capital improvements over a period of approximately four years, in
exchange for a 30% interest in the joint venture.
 
Kansas City
 Southern will contribute a
320 mile rail line between
Meridian
,
Mississippi
 and
Shreveport
,
Louisiana
 (the “Meridian
Speedway”).
 
Closing of the
transaction is conditioned on the receipt of the necessary authority from the
Surface Transportation Board.
 

Accordingly, if the transaction is authorized and consummated, NS
expects to recognize its pro rata share of the joint venture’s earnings
or loss as required under the equity method of accounting.
 
The transaction is expected to be
modestly dilutive in the early years of the venture due to lost interest income
on the cash contributed to the joint venture.
 
However, NS expects that the dilution
from the lost interest income will be offset from additional traffic as the
investment is made and improvements are completed.
 
The joint venture is expected to
increase capacity and improve service on the Meridian Speedway.

NS
expects to spend $50 million, in the near future, connected with Heartland
Corridor-related projects.
 
The
Heartland Corridor is a package of proposed clearance improvements and other
facilities that will create a seamless high-capacity intermodal route across
Virginia

and
West Virginia
 to
Midwest

markets.
 
Completion of the related
projects is contingent on securing public or third-party funding commitments.

NS
and other railroads have agreed to participate in the Chicago Region
Environmental and Transportation Efficiency (CREATE) project in
Chicago
..
 
The intent of the proposed
public-private partnership is to reduce rail and highway congestion and add
freight and passenger capacity in the metropolitan
Chicago

area.
 
A portion of the public
funding has been approved and the parties are working to develop a list of
projects to be included in Phase I of the project.
 
Funding requirements will be determined
by the selection of Phase I projects.
 

The railroads expect to complete Phase I over the next four years.

Cash
used for financing activities

was $456 million in 2005, compared with $233 million in 2004 and
$314 million in 2003.
 
Financing
activity in 2005 included: (1) the issuance of $300 million aggregate principal
amount of 6% unsecured notes due March 2105, and (2) the issuance of $717
million of unsecured notes ($350 million at 5.64% due 2029 and
$367 million at 5.59% due 2025) and payment of $218 million of
premium in exchange for $717 million of previously issued unsecured notes
($350 million at 7.8% due 2027, $200 million at 7.25% due 2031, and
$167 million at 9.0% due 2021) (see Note 8).
 
The $218 million cash premium payment is
reflected as a reduction of debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
Statement of Cash Flows and will be amortized as additional interest expense
over the terms of the new debt.
 

Investing activities in 2005 and 2004 also included substantial proceeds
from employee exercise of stock options.
 

NS’ debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 42.7% at
Dec. 31, 2005
, and 48.5% at
Dec. 31, 2004
..

In
November 2005, NS’ Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
50 million shares of NS Common Stock through the end of 2015.
 
The timing and volume of any purchases
will be guided by management’s assessment of market conditions and other
pertinent factors.
 
Near-term
purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated
cash; however, future funding sources could include proceeds from the sale of
commercial paper notes or the issuance of long-term debt.

NS
currently has in place and available a $1 billion, five-year credit agreement,
which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial
covenants.
 
There were no amounts
outstanding under this facility at
Dec. 31,
,
and NS is in compliance with all of the financial covenants.
 
NS also has in place a shelf registration
statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC in September 2004 with
$700 million of available capacity
(see Note 8).
 

On
July 18, 2005
, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) upgraded its ratings on NS’
unsecured debt from BBB to BBB+.
 

Moody’s rating remains at Baa1, comparable to S&P’s.

APPLICATION
OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with
U.S.
 generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
 
These estimates and assumptions may
require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and
future events are likely to occur that may require management to change
them.
 
Accordingly, management
regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical
experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that
management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
 
Management discusses the development,
selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the
Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.

Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits

Accounting
for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make
several estimates and assumptions (see Note 11).
 
These include the expected rate of
return from investment of the plans' assets, projected increases in medical
costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected
earnings and mortality.
 
In
addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate
environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present
value.
 
Management makes these
estimates based on the company's historical experience and other information
that it deems pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of
future stock market performance).
 

Management engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to assist it
in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities.

NS'
net pension benefit, which is included in “Compensation and benefits”
on its Consolidated Income Statement, was $23 million for the year ended
Dec. 31, 2005
..
 
In
recording this amount, NS assumed a long-term investment rate of return of
 
9%.
 

Investment experience of the pension fund over the past 10-, 15- and
20-year periods has been a rate of return in excess of 10%.
 
A one percentage point change to this
rate of return assumption would result in an $18 million change to the pension
credit and, as a result, an equal change in “Compensation and
benefits” expense.
 
Changes
that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age,
projected earnings and mortality would not be expected to have a material
effect on NS' net pension benefit or net pension asset in the future.
 
The net pension asset is recorded at its
net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest
rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments.
 
Specifically, NS refers to Moody’s
seasoned Aa corporate bond yields and the changes in such yields; therefore,
management has little discretion in this assumption.

NS'
net cost for other postretirement benefits, which is also included in
“Compensation and benefits,” was $62 million for the year ended
Dec. 31, 2005
..
 
In
recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement
benefits, which is included in “Other benefits” as disclosed in
Note 11, management estimated future increases in health-care costs.
 
These assumptions, along with the effect
of a one percentage point change in them, are described in Note 11.

Properties
and Depreciation

Most
of NS' total assets are comprised of long-lived railway properties (see Note
6).
 
As disclosed in Note 1,
NS' properties are depreciated using group depreciation.
 
Rail is depreciated primarily on the
basis of use measured by gross-ton miles.
 

Other properties are depreciated generally using the straight-line
method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives.
 
NS reviews the carrying amount of
properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such
carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash
flows.
 
Assets that are deemed
impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying
amount or fair value.

NS'
depreciation expense is based on management's assumptions concerning service
lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be
received upon their retirement.
 

These assumptions are the product of periodic depreciation studies that
are performed by a firm of consulting engineers.
 
These studies analyze NS' historical
patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any expected change
in operation or maintenance practices.
 

NS' recent experience with these studies has been that while they do
result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties, these changes
have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense.
 
The studies may also indicate that the
recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the
amount indicated by the study.
 
Any
such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense
over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property.
 
NS' “Depreciation expense”
for the year ended
Dec. 31, 2005
, amounted to $774
million.
 
NS' weighted-average
depreciation rates for 2005 are disclosed in Note 6; a one-tenth percentage
point increase (or decrease) in these rates would have resulted in a
$25 million increase (or decrease) to NS' depreciation expense.

Personal
Injury, Environmental and Legal Liabilities

NS'
expense for “Casualties and other claims” amounted to $224 million
for the year ended
Dec. 31, 2005
..
 
Most of this expense was composed of NS'
accrual related to personal injury liabilities (see discussion of FELA in the
discussion captioned “Casualties and other claims” above).
 
Job-related personal injury and
occupational claims are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to
railroads.
 
FELA’s fault-based
tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as
compared with a no-fault worker’s compensation system.
 
The variability inherent in this system
could result in actual costs being very different from the liability
recorded.
 
In all cases, NS records
a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and
estimable.

NS
engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid in valuing its personal
injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during the year.
 
For employee personal injury cases, the
actuarial firm studies NS' historical patterns of reserving for claims and
subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences.
 
An estimate of the ultimate amount of
the liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims, is
based on the results of this analysis.
 

For occupational injury claims, the actuarial firm studies NS’
history of claim filings, severity, payments and other relevant facts.
 
Additionally, the estimate of the
ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims
that have been incurred but not reported by projecting NS’ experience
into the future as far as can be reasonably determined.
 
NS has recorded this actuarially
determined liability.
 
The liability
is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case
reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in
the periodic studies.
 
Accordingly,
there could be significant changes in the liability, which NS would recognize
when such a change became known.
 

The most recent actuarial study, completed in the fourth quarter of
2005, resulted in a slight decrease to NS' personal injury liability during the
fourth quarter.
 
While the liability
recorded is
support
ed by the most recent study, it is reasonably
possible that the liability could be higher or lower.

NS
is subject to various jurisdictions' environmental laws and regulations.
 
It is NS' policy to record a liability
where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated
reasonably (see Note 18).
 

Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of
all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability
estimates.
 
NS also has established
an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and
interpret its environmental policy.

Operating
expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $16 million in 2005,
$11 million in 2004 and $9 million in 2003, and capital expenditures totaled
approximately $9 million in each of 2005, 2004 and 2003.
 
Capital expenditures in 2006 are
expected to be comparable to those in 2005.

NS'
balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount
of $58 million at
Dec. 31, 2005
, and $64 million at
Dec. 31, 2004
 (of which $12 million was accounted for as a
current liability at
Dec. 31, 2005
, and 2004).
 
At
Dec. 31,
,
the liability represented NS' estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation
costs based on available information at 189 identified locations.
 
On that date, 16 sites accounted
for $30 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to
be material.
 
NS anticipates that
much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs
will be paid out over a longer period.

At
some of the 189 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with
a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible
parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several
liability for cleanup costs.

With
respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or
comparable state authorities), estimates of NS' ultimate potential financial
exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are
necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently
available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup
technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full
extent of contamination and each potential participant's share of any estimated
loss (and that participant's ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and
regulatory standards governing liability.
 

NS estimates its environmental remediation liability on a site-by-site
basis, using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for
each site.
 
As a result, it is not
practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many
assumptions and judgments.
 
NS has
consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental
liabilities.

Based
on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, management believes
that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with those
environmental matters of which the Corporation is aware.
 
Further, management believes that it is
unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate,
will have a material adverse effect on NS' financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

Norfolk
 Southern and certain
subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating
principally to railroad operations.
 

When management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is
accrued through a charge to expenses.
 

While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits
and claims is dependent on future developments, in management's opinion the
recorded liability, if any, is adequate to cover the future payment of such
liability and claims.
 
However, the
final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty,
and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that
could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or
quarter.
 
Any adjustments to
recorded liabilities will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such
adjustments are known.

Income
Taxes

NS'
net long-term deferred tax liability totaled $6,620 million at
Dec. 31, 2005
 (see Note 3).
 

This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax
consequences of items recognized in the financial statements.
 
After application of the federal
statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the
timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax
returns
..
 
For state income and other taxes,
judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various
jurisdictions.
 
A valuation
allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not
that its deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 
NS had a $16 million valuation allowance
on $775 million of deferred tax assets as of
Dec.
 31, 2005
, reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be
realized.
 
In addition, NS has a
recorded liability for its estimate of potential income tax exposures.
 
Management believes this liability for
potential exposure to be adequate.
 

Income tax expense is adjusted to the extent the final outcome of these
matters differs from the amounts recorded.
 

For every one half percent change in the 2005 effective rate net income
would have changed by $8 million.

OTHER
MATTERS

Labor
Agreements

Approximately
26,000, or about 85%, of NS' railroad employees are covered by collective
bargaining agreements with various labor unions.  These agreements remain
in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act (RLA).  NS
largely bargains in concert with other major railroads. Moratorium provisions
in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and the unions may propose
labor agreement changes.
 
The previous
moratorium provisions expired in the latter part of 2004 and the railroads and
the rail labor unions thereafter served new proposals to begin the next
bargaining round.
 
Industry issues
include train crew staffing and employee contributions for health care
benefits.

Seven
rail unions (Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, Brotherhood of
Maintenance of Way Employes, American Train Dispatchers Association,
Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, International Brotherhood of Blacksmiths and
Boilermakers, National Conference of
Firemen
and
Oilers, and Sheet Metal Workers
International Association) are bargaining together under the auspices of the
Rail Labor Bargaining Coalition (RLBC).
 

The railroads filed for mediation with the United Transportation Union
(UTU) and with the RLBC unions.
 
The
status quo is preserved during mediation while a federal mediator assists the
parties in their efforts to reach agreement.
 
If the NMB were to terminate mediation,
it would, at that time, propose that the parties arbitrate their
differences.
 
A strike could occur
30 days thereafter if the parties did not accept arbitration. However, the
President of the
United States of America
 could then appoint an
Emergency Board which would delay any strike for a further 60 days while the
Board made recommendations and the parties and engaged in further negotiations.

 
The outcome of the negotiations
cannot be determined at this point.

Market
Risks and Hedging Activities

NS
has used derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in
its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates.

In
2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel
consumption.
 
The intent of the
program is to assist in the management of NS' aggregate risk exposure to fuel
price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS' operating margins and
profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments.

Diesel
fuel costs represented 11% of NS' operating expenses for 2005.
 
The program provides that NS will not
enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no
more than 80% of NS' average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for any
month within any 36-month period.

As
of
Dec. 31, 2005
, through swap transactions,
NS has hedged approximately 4% of expected 2006 diesel fuel requirements.
 
The effect of these hedges is to yield
an average cost of 89 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and
transportation.
 
A 10% decrease in
diesel fuel prices would reduce NS' asset related to the swaps by approximately
$4 million as of
Dec. 31, 2005
..

However,
with fuel prices near historic highs and fuel surcharges being collected under
certain tariffs and contracts, NS has not entered into additional hedges since
May 2004.
 
Consequently, the past
pattern of entering into regular monthly swaps may not be indicative of future
hedging activity.
 
If diesel fuel
prices remain at their current levels, or increase further, diesel fuel expense
will be higher going forward.

NS
manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both
fixed- and floating-rate debt instruments and by entering into interest-rate
hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio.

At
Dec. 31, 2005
, NS' debt subject to interest rate fluctuations
totaled $285 million.
 
A 1% increase
in interest rates would increase NS' total annual interest expense related to
all its variable debt by approximately $3 million.
 
Management considers it unlikely that
interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in
a material adverse effect on NS' financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

Some
of NS' capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7%, were
effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap
agreements.
 
On
Dec. 31, 2005
, the average pay rate under these agreements was
7%, and the average receive rate was 5%.
 

During 2005, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by
$2 million.
 
A portion of the lease
obligations is payable in Japanese yen.
 

NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each
lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen-denominated obligation.
 
Most of these deposits are held by
foreign banks, primarily Japanese.
 

As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to
Japan
..
 
Counterparties to the interest rate
swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions
believed by management to be creditworthy.

New
Accounting Pronouncement

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based
Payments”.
 
This statement
establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity
exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, such as stock-based
compensation plans.
 
NS will adopt
this standard in the first quarter of 2006, which will result in higher
compensation expense (see Note 1).
 

The statement applies to all awards granted after the effective date and
to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after that date, as well as
awards that are unvested at the effective date.

Inflation

In
preparing financial statements,
U.S.
 generally accepted
accounting principles require the use of historical cost that disregards the
effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property.
 
NS, a capital-intensive company, has
most of its capital invested in such assets.
 
The replacement cost of these assets, as
well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than
the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

This
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations contains forward-looking statements that may be identified by the
use of words like “believe,” “expect,”
“anticipate” and “project.” Forward-looking statements
reflect management's good-faith evaluation of information currently
available.
 
However, such statements
are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external
variables over which management has little or no control, including:
legislative and regulatory developments; competition and consolidation within
the transportation industry; domestic and international economic conditions;
the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight;
the operations of carriers with which we interchange; labor difficulties,
including strikes and work stoppages; disruptions to our technology infrastructure
including our computer systems; natural events such as severe weather, floods
and hurricanes; acts of terrorism or war; fluctuation in prices of key
materials, in particular diesel fuel; and changes in securities and capital
markets.
 
Forward-looking statements
are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or
results.
 
Nor will they necessarily
prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance
or results will be achieved.
 
As a
result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed
in forward-looking statements.
 
NS
undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements.

This assessment was based on criteria
for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
 

Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the Corporation
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting

The
Stockholders and Board of Directors

Norfolk
 Southern Corporation:

We
have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Report of
Management, that Norfolk Southern Corporation maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework,

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).
 
Norfolk Southern
Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting.
 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment
and an opinion on the effectiveness of Norfolk Southern Corporation’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (
United States
).
 
Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
 
Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
 
We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with
U.S.
 generally accepted
accounting principles.
 
A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.
 

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that Norfolk Southern Corporation
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework,

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).
 
Also in our opinion,
Norfolk Southern Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework,

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).

significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.
 

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Norfolk Southern
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the

Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

The
following Notes are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

1.
 
Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Description
of Business

Norfolk
Southern Corporation is a Virginia-based holding company engaged principally in
the rail transportation business, operating approximately 21,200 route miles
primarily in the East and
Midwest
..
 

These consolidated financial statements include Norfolk Southern
Corporation (
Norfolk
 Southern) and its
majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries (collectively, NS).
 
Norfolk
 Southern's major subsidiary
is Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR). All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The
railroad transports raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods
classified in the following market groups (percent of total railway operating
revenues in 2005): coal (25%); intermodal (21%); automotive (12%);
metals/construction (12%); chemicals (11%); agriculture/consumer products/
government (10%); and paper/clay/forest products (9%).
 
Although most of NS’ customers are
domestic, ultimate points of origination or destination for some of the
products transported (particularly coal bound for export and some intermodal
containers) may be outside the
United States
..
 
Approximately 85% of NS' railroad
employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 14 different
labor unions.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with
U.S.
 generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
 
Management reviews its estimates,
including those related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets, as
well as liabilities for litigation, environmental remediation, casualty claims,
income taxes, and pension and postretirement benefits.
 
Changes in facts and circumstances may
result in revised estimates.

Revenue
Recognition

Transportation
revenue is recognized proportionally as a shipment moves from origin to
destination and related expenses are recognized as incurred.
 
Refunds (which are primarily
volume-based incentives) are recorded as a reduction to revenues on the basis
of management's best estimate of projected liability, which is based on
historical activity, current traffic counts and the expectation of future
activity.
 
NS regularly monitors its
contract refund liability, and historically, the estimates have not differed
significantly from the amounts ultimately refunded.
 
Switching, demurrage and other
incidental service revenues are recognized when the services are performed.

Derivatives

NS
does not engage in the trading of derivatives.
 
NS uses derivative financial instruments
to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and in the management
of its mix of fixed and floating-rate debt.
 
Management has determined that these
derivative instruments qualify as either fair-value or cash-flow hedges, having
values that highly correlate with the underlying hedged exposures, and have
designated such instruments as hedging transactions.
 
Income and expense related to the
derivative financial instruments are recorded in the same category as generated
by the underlying asset or liability.
 

Credit risk related to the derivative financial instruments is considered
to be minimal and is managed by requiring high credit standards for
counterparties and periodic settlements (see Note 16).

Stock-Based
Compensation

NS
has stock-based employee compensation plans, which are more fully described in
Note 12.
 
Through
Dec. 31, 2005
, NS applied the intrinsic value recognition and
measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees” (APB Opinion No. 25), and related interpretations in
accounting for these plans (See “Required Accounting Change in
2006,” below).

The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if
NS had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (SFAS No. 123), to stock-based employee compensation:

Required Accounting Change
in 2006

Effective

January 1, 2006
, NS adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards, No. 123(R), “Share Based Payments,”
[SFAS No. 123(R)].
 
This statement
applies to awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled after the
effective date as well as awards that are unvested at the effective date and
includes, among other things, the requirement to expense the fair value of
stock options.
 
In November 2005,
the Board of Directors of NS changed the vesting period on options granted in
January 2005 from three years to one year in order to reduce future
compensation expense.
 
At the time,
these options had an intrinsic value of approximately $9 each and the
modification resulted in less than $1 million of compensation expense.
 
Future compensation expense will be reduced
by $10 million as a result of this modification.

Under
SFAS No. 123(R), all new awards granted to retirement eligible employees must
be expensed immediately.
 
Under APB
Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations, such awards were amortized over
the stated service period.
 
Such awards were treated similarly under
SFAS No. 123 in the pro forma
amounts
disclosed in the preceding table.
 

As a result of SFAS No. 123(R), expense recognition is
accelerated on grants to retirement eligible
employees and the effect of this acceleration will be
approximately $20 million of additional compensation expense
in 2006.

Cash
Equivalents

“Cash
equivalents” are highly liquid investments purchased three months or less
from maturity.

Investments

Debt
securities classified as “held-to-maturity” are reported at
amortized cost and marketable equity and debt securities classified as
“trading” or “available-for-sale” are recorded at fair
value.
 
Unrealized after-tax gains
and losses for investments designated as “available-for-sale,” are
recognized in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”

Investments
where NS has the ability to exercise significant influence over but does not
control the entity are accounted for using the equity method in accordance with
APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock.”

Materials
and Supplies

“Materials
and supplies,” consisting mainly of fuel oil and items for maintenance of
property and equipment, are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
 
The cost of materials and supplies
expected to be used in capital additions or improvements is included in
“Properties.”

Properties

“Properties”
are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using group
depreciation.
 
Rail is depreciated primarily
on the basis of use measured by gross ton-miles.
 
Other properties are depreciated
generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service
or lease lives.
 
Depletion of
natural resources (see Note 2) is based on units of production.
 
Depreciation in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows includes depreciation and depletion.
 
NS capitalizes interest on major capital
projects during the period of their construction.
 
Expenditures, including those on leased
assets that extend an asset's useful life or increase its utility, are
capitalized.
 
Costs related to
repairs and maintenance activities that do not extend an asset’s useful
life or increase its utility are expensed when such repairs are performed.
 
When properties other than land and
nonrail assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost
of the assets, net of sale proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulated
depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized through income.
 
Gains and losses on disposal of land and
nonrail assets are included in “Other income - net” (see Note 2)
since such income is not a product of NS’ railroad operations.

NS
reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable
based on future undiscounted cash flows.
 

Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded
at the lower of carrying amount or fair value (see Note 6).

Required
Accounting Changes in 2003

NS
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, “Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations,” (SFAS No. 143) effective Jan. 1, 2003,
and recorded a $110 million net adjustment ($182 million before taxes) for
the cumulative effect of this change in accounting on years prior to 2003.
 
Pursuant to SFAS No. 143, the cost to
remove crossties must be recorded as an expense when incurred; previously these
removal costs were accrued as a component of depreciation.
 
This change in accounting lowered depreciation
expense (because the depreciation rate for crossties no longer reflects cost to
remove) and increased compensation and benefits and other expenses (for the
costs to remove retired assets).
  

The net effect to total railway operating expenses and net income was
not material.

NS also adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,” (FIN No. 46) effective Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $4
million net adjustment ($6 million before taxes) for the cumulative effect
of this change in accounting on years prior to 2003.
 
Pursuant to FIN No. 46, NS consolidated
a special-purpose entity that leased certain locomotives to NS.
 
This entity’s assets and
liabilities at
Jan. 1, 2003
,
included $169 million of locomotives and $157 million of debt related to their
purchase as well as a $6 million minority interest liability.
 
This change in accounting increased
depreciation and interest expense (to reflect the locomotives as owned assets)
and lowered lease expense.
 
The net
effect to total railway operating expenses and net income was not
material.

The cumulative effect of
these changes amounted to $114 million, or 29 cents per share, in 2003.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts have been
reclassified to conform to current presentation.
 
Specifically, $112 million of auction
rate securities held at
Dec. 31, 2004
, previously classified as cash equivalents, have been

reclassified as short-term investments.
 

These securities were sold in the first quarter of 2005 at market value,
which was equal to their carrying cost, and accordingly are included in
“Investment sales and other transactions” in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.
 
In
addition, the following items shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
Dec. 31, 2004, have been reclassified to conform to the current
presentation:
 
(1) “Investment
in Conrail” and the amount of investments included in “Other
assets” have been reclassified and comprise “Investments” and
(2) “Due to Conrail” has been reclassified and is included in the
amount shown for “Accounts Payable.”

noncarrier subsidiaries as well as the costs incurred by those subsidiaries in
their operations.
 
NS has a 40.5%
interest in a limited liability company that owns and operates facilities that
produce synthetic fuel from coal.
 
The
production of synthetic fuel results in tax credits as well as expenses related
to the investments.
 
The expenses
are classified in “Equity in losses of partnerships” above.

“Other
current assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes prepaid interest
of $47 million at
Dec. 31, 2005
, and $48 million at

In
June 2005,
Ohio
 enacted tax legislation
that phases out its Corporate Franchise Tax, which was generally based on
federal taxable income, and phases in a new gross receipts tax called the
Commercial Activity Tax, which is based on current year sales and rentals.
 
The phased elimination of the Corporate
Franchise Tax resulted in a reduction in NS’ deferred income tax
liability, as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes,” which, as noted above, decreased
deferred tax expense by $96 million.

Deferred
Tax Assets and Liabilities

Certain
items are reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax
purposes.
 
Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recorded in recognition of these differences.

The
tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of
the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows:

(6,620)

$

(6,550)

Net
deferred income tax liabilities increased by $3,113 million in 2004 as a result
of the Conrail Corporate Reorganization (see Note 5).
 
Except for amounts for which a valuation
allowance has been provided, management believes that it is more likely
than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the deferred
tax assets.
 
The valuation allowance
at the end of each year relates to subsidiary state income tax net
operating losses that may not be utilized prior to their expiration.
 
The total valuation allowance decreased
$5 million in 2005, $1 million in 2004 and $2 million in 2003.

Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) Reviews

Consolidated
federal income tax
returns
 have been examined and
Revenue Agent Reports have been received for all years up to and including
2001.
 
In 2004, the favorable
resolution of the IRS audit of a synthetic fuel-related investment is reflected
in the “Tax credits” line of the reconciliation of statutory rate
to the effective rate.
 
In 2003, the
favorable resolution of prior years’ audits is reflected in the
“Other – net” line of the reconciliation of statutory rate to
the effective rate, as shown above, and comprised most of that line item.
 
The consolidated federal income tax
returns
 for 2002 and 2003 are being
audited by the IRS.
 
The IRS
examination for 2002 and 2003 is expected to be completed by the end of
2006.
 
Management believes that
adequate provision has been made for any additional taxes and interest thereon
that might arise as a result of IRS examinations.

4.
 
Accounts Receivable

Until
May 2005, NS had in place an accounts receivable sales program.
 
Under this program a bankruptcy-remote
special purpose subsidiary of NS sold without recourse undivided ownership
interests in a pool of accounts receivable.
 
While there were some sales during 2004
and 2003, there were no accounts receivable sold under this arrangement as of
Dec. 31, 2004
..
 
The
change in “Accounts receivable” included on the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows related to receivable sales was zero for 2005 and 2004
and a decrease of $30 million in 2003.
 
The fees associated with sales, which
are based on the buyers' financing costs, are included in “Other income
– net” (see Note 2).

NS'
allowance for doubtful accounts was $6 million at
Dec.
 31, 2005
, and $9 million at
Dec. 31, 2004
..
 
To determine its allowance for doubtful
accounts, NS evaluates historical loss experience (which has not been
significant), the characteristics of current accounts, as well as general
economic conditions and trends.

Investment
in Conrail and Operations Over Its Lines

Overview

Through a limited liability company,
Norfolk
 Southern and CSX Corporation (CSX) jointly own
Conrail Inc. (Conrail), whose primary subsidiary is Consolidated Rail
Corporation (CRC).
 
NS has a 58%
economic and 50% voting interest in the jointly owned entity, and CSX has the
remainder of the economic and voting interests.
 
CRC owns and operates certain properties
(the Shared Assets Areas) for the joint and exclusive benefit of Norfolk
Southern Railway Company (NSR) and CSX Transportation Inc. (CSXT).
 
The costs of operating the Shared Assets
Areas are borne by NSR and CSXT based on usage.
 
In addition, NSR and CSXT pay CRC a fee
for access to the Shared Assets Areas.

Conrail
Corporate Reorganization

On
August 27, 2004
, NS, CSX and Conrail
completed a reorganization of Conrail (Conrail Corporate Reorganization), which
established direct ownership and control by NSR and CSXT of two former CRC
subsidiaries, Pennsylvania Lines LLC (PRR) and New York Central Lines LLC
(NYC), respectively.
 
Prior to the
Conrail Corporate Reorganization, NSR operated the routes and assets of PRR and
CSXT operated the routes and assets of NYC, each in accordance with operating
and lease agreements.
 
Pursuant to
the Conrail Corporate Reorganization, the operating and lease agreements were
terminated and PRR and NYC were merged into NSR and CSXT, respectively.
 
The reorganization did not involve the
Shared Assets Areas and did not affect the competitive rail service provided in
the Shared Assets Areas.
 
Conrail
continues to own, manage and operate the Shared Assets Areas as previously
approved by the Surface Transportation Board (STB).

As a part of the Conrail Corporate Reorganization,
Conrail restructured its existing unsecured and secured public indebtedness,
with the consent of Conrail’s debtholders.
 
Prior to the restructuring, there were
two series of unsecured public debentures with an outstanding principal amount
of approximately $800 million and 13 series of secured debt with an outstanding
principal amount of approximately $300 million.
 
Guaranteed debt securities were offered
in an approximate 58%/42% ratio in exchange for Conrail’s unsecured
debentures.
 
Of the $800 million
unsecured public debentures, $779 million were tendered and accepted for exchange,
and NSR issued unsecured public debentures with a total principal of $452
million and an issue-date fair value of $595 million.
 
Conrail’s secured debt and lease
obligations remain obligations of Conrail and are
support
ed by leases and subleases
which are the direct lease and sublease obligations of NSR or CSXT.
 
Substantially all of these NSR
obligations are capital leases and, accordingly, are a component of NS’
capital lease obligations (see Note 8).

NS accounted for the transaction at fair value,
which resulted in the recognition of a $53 million net gain (reported in
“Other income – net”) from the tax-free distribution to NS of
a portion of its investment in Conrail.
 

NS concluded that fair value was the appropriate measurement for 42% of
PRR because the transaction resulted in the complete ownership and control of
PRR.
 
The remaining 58% of PRR was
recorded at NS’ carryover basis.
 

As a result of the transaction, NS’ investment in Conrail no
longer includes amounts related to PRR and NYC.
 
Instead the assets and liabilities of
PRR are reflected in their respective line items in NS’ Consolidated
Balance Sheet and amounts due to PRR were extinguished.

The
following summarizes the effect of the transaction on NS’ Consolidated
Balance Sheet ($ in millions):

The amounts shown above for the net assets received
reflect the fair value of such assets.
 

Properties have been valued based on information received from an
independent valuation consultant.
 

The assets of PRR included the note due from NSR discussed below under
the heading “Related Party Transactions,” which resulted in its
effectively being extinguished.
 

Debt has been recorded at fair value based on interest rates at the time
of the reorganization.
 
The
reduction to NS’ investment in Conrail represents the removal of amounts
related to NS’ equity interests in PRR and NYC as well as amounts related
to the Conrail debt that was exchanged or effectively assumed by the leases and
subleases entered into to
support
 those obligations.

On the Consolidated Statements of Income,
“Conrail rents and services” is reduced as a result of the
transaction.
 
After the Conrail
Corporate Reorganization, “Conrail rents and services” reflects
only the expenses associated with the Shared Assets Areas, and other expenses
(primarily the depreciation related to the PRR assets) are reflected in their
respective line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
 
The transaction’s impact on net
income was the $53 million gain discussed above.
 
Prospectively, the transaction will have
no effect on revenues and will not have a significant ongoing effect on net
income.
 
Had the transaction been
consummated before the periods presented, there would have been no change in
revenues and no significant change to net income.

NS is continuing to apply
the equity method of accounting to its remaining investment in Conrail in
accordance with APB Opinion No. 18, "The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock."
 

NS is amortizing the excess of the purchase price over Conrail's net
equity using the principles of purchase accounting, based primarily on the
estimated remaining useful lives of Conrail's depreciable property and
equipment, including the related deferred tax effect of the differences in tax
and accounting bases for certain assets, as all of the purchase price at
acquisition was allocable to Conrail’s tangible assets and
liabilities.
 
At
Dec. 31, 2005
, the difference between NS' investment in Conrail
and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity was $593 million.

Related-Party Transactions

CRC
owns and operates certain properties (the Shared Assets Areas) for the joint
and exclusive benefit of NSR and CSXT.
 

NSR and CSXT pay CRC a fee for joint and exclusive access to the Shared
Assets Areas.
 
In addition, NSR and
CSXT pay, based on usage, the costs incurred by CRC to operate the Shared
Assets Areas.
 
Future minimum lease
payments due to CRC under the Shared Assets Areas agreements are
as follows: $25 million in each of 2006 through 2010 and
$331 million thereafter.

The components of
"Conrail rents and services" are as follows:

*After the reorganization,

Prior to the Conrail
Corporate Reorganization, a significant portion of the payments made to PRR was
borrowed back from a subsidiary of PRR under a note due in 2032.
 
Amounts outstanding under this note
comprised the long‑term balance of “Due to Conrail,” and this
note was effectively extinguished by the reorganization.
 
"Due to Conrail" included in “Accounts
payable” (see Note 7) is composed principally of amounts related to
expenses included in "Conrail rents and services," as discussed
above.
 
“Long-term advances
from Conrail,” included in “Other liabilities” (see Note 10),
bear interest at an average rate of 4.4% and are due in 2035.

NS provides certain general
and administrative
support
 functions to Conrail, the
fees for which are billed in accordance with several service-provider
arrangements and amount to approximately $7 million annually.

Summary Financial
Information – Conrail

As a result of the Conrail
Corporate Reorganization discussed above, two CRC subsidiaries, PRR and NYC,
were distributed to NS and CSX, respectively, and CRC’s public
indebtedness was restructured.
 
The
results of the operations of these subsidiaries and their net assets are
presented in the following financial information as “Discontinued
Operations.”
 
The 2005 and
2004 summarized information was derived from unaudited financial

cumulative effect of this change in accounting on years prior to 2004.
 
Conrail adopted SFAS No. 143, effective
Jan. 1, 2003
, and recorded a $40 million net adjustment for the
cumulative effect of this change in accounting on years prior to 2003
(including $38 million related to discontinued operations).
 
NS excluded this amount from its determination
of equity in earnings of Conrail because an amount related to Conrail is
included in NS’ cumulative effect adjustment for SFAS No. 143.

Impairment
of Telecommunications Assets in 2003

In
2003, NS recorded an $84 million non-cash reduction in the carrying value of
certain telecommunications assets to recognize their impaired value in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”
 
NS’ subsidiary, Thoroughbred
Technology and Telecommunications (T-Cubed), developed fiber optic
infrastructure with companies in the telecommunications industry.
 
This industry experienced a severe
downturn in 2003; accordingly, T-Cubed monitored the carrying amount of these
assets through independent fair market value appraisals.
 
As a result of a deterioration in the
long-term prospects for these assets, an updated appraisal obtained in the
fourth quarter of 2003 indicated a significant decline in their value.
 
T-Cubed continues to monitor the
carrying value of these assets.

Capitalized

Total
interest cost incurred on debt in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $505 million, $499

In
May 2005, NS issued $717 million of unsecured notes ($350 million at 5.64% due
2029 and $367 million at 5.59% due 2025) and paid $218 million of premium
in exchange for $717 million of its previously issued unsecured notes ($350
million at 7.8% due 2027, $200 million at 7.25% due 2031, and $167 million at
9.0% due 2021).
 
The $218 million
cash premium payment is reflected as a reduction of debt in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet and Statement of Cash Flows and is included in “Discounts
and premiums, net.”
 
The
premium is being amortized as additional interest expense over the terms of the
new debt, resulting in effective interest rates of 8.7% for the 2029 notes and
9.0% for the 2025 notes.

In
August 2004, pursuant to the Conrail Corporate Reorganization (see Note 5), NSR
issued unsecured public debentures with a total principal of $452 million ($314
million at 9.75% due 2020 and $138 million at 7.875% due 2043) and fair
value of $595 million.
 
This
difference is included in “Discounts and premiums, net” and is
being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the terms of the notes,
resulting in effective interest rates of 6.0% for the 2020 notes and 6.2% for
the 2043 notes.

The
railroad equipment obligations and the capitalized leases are secured by liens
on the underlying equipment.
 

Certain lease obligations require the maintenance of yen-denominated
deposits, which are pledged to the lessor to satisfy yen-denominated lease
payments.
 
These deposits are
included in “Other assets” on the balance sheet and totaled $87
million at
Dec. 31, 2005
, and $100 million at
Dec. 31, 2004
..

Shelf
Registration

NS has
on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Form S-3 shelf
registration statement covering the issu­ance of up to $1 billion of
registered debt or equity securities.
 

In 2005, NS issued $300 million of 6% senior notes due March 2105
under this shelf registration statement.

Credit
Agreement, Debt Covenants and Commercial Paper

In
August 2004, NS renewed its $1 billion credit facility under substantially the
same terms and conditions as the previous facility for a five-year term
expiring in 2009.
 
Any borrowings
under the credit agreement are contingent on the continuing effectiveness of
the representations and warranties made at the inception of the agreement.
 
NS is subject to various financial
covenants with respect to its debt and under its credit agreement, including a
minimum net worth requirement, a maximum leverage ratio restriction, certain
restrictions on the issuance of further debt by NS or its subsidiaries and the
consolidation, merger or sale of substantially all of NS’ assets.
 
At
Dec. 31,
,
NS was in compliance with all financial covenants.

NS
has the ability to issue commercial paper
support
ed by its $1 billion credit
agreement.
 
At
Dec. 31, 2005
, and
Dec. 31,
,
NS had no outstanding commercial paper or borrowings under the credit agreement.

 Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits

Norfolk
 Southern
and certain subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension
plans covering principally salaried employees.
 
Norfolk

Southern and certain subsidiaries also provide specified health care and death
benefits to eligible retired employees and their dependents.
 
Under the present plans, which may be
amended or terminated at NS' option, a defined percentage of health care
expenses is
covered, reduced by any deductibles,
copayments, Medicare payments and, in some cases, coverage provided under other
group insurance policies.

Asset Management

Eleven investment firms
manage the Company’s defined benefit pension plan’s assets under
investment guidelines approved by the Board of Directors.
 
Investments are restricted to domestic
fixed income
 securities, international fixed income securities, domestic
and international equity investments and unleveraged exchange-traded options
and financial futures.
 
Limitations
restrict investment concentration and use of certain derivative instruments.
 
The target asset allocation for equity
is 75% of the pension plan’s assets.
 

Fixed income investments must have an average rating of “AA”
or better and all fixed income securities must be rated “A” or
better except bond index funds.
 

Equity investments must be in liquid securities listed on national
exchanges.
 
No investment is
permitted in the securities of Norfolk Southern Corporation or its subsidiaries
(except through commingled pension trust funds).
 
Investment managers’
returns

are expected to exceed selected market indices by prescribed margins.

NS’
pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at
Dec.
 31, 2005
 and 2004, by asset category, are as follows:

The

life insurance policies with an asset allocation at
Dec.

, of 66% in equity securities and 34% in debt securities compared with
67% in equity securities and 33% in debt securities at
Dec. 31, 2004
..
 
The
target asset allocation for equity is between 50% and 75% of the plan’s
assets.

The plans’ assumed
future
returns
 are based principally on the asset allocation and on
the historic
returns
 for the plans’ asset classes determined from
both actual plan
returns
 and, over longer time periods, market
returns
 for those asset classes.

Voluntary Separation Program in 2003

Compensation and benefits
expense in 2003 includes $107 million of costs related to a voluntary
separation program undertaken in the fourth quarter.
 
Through the program, 553 nonagreement
employees were separated from service, of which 314 retired under
Norfolk
 Southern’s retirement plan.
 
The costs include $66 million for
separation payments and other benefits of the program and $41 million of costs
related to the pension and other benefit plans.

Medicare Changes

The Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed
into law in December 2003.
 
The
Act introduced a new prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D)
as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans
that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part
D.
 
The actuary for Norfolk
Southern’s medical plan has determined that Norfolk Southern’s
medical plan’s prescription drug benefit for 2006 is
 actuarially
equivalent to the new prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D.
   
In accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Staff Position No. 106-1, NS elected to take into
account these legislative changes in the measurement of its postretirement
benefit obligations, which resulted in a reduction of $15 million in the net
benefit cost in 2005, $9 million in 2004 and no effect on the net benefit
cost in 2003.

Pension
Assumptions

Pension
and other postretirement benefit costs are determined based on actuarial
valuations that reflect appropriate assumptions as of the measurement date,
ordinarily the beginning of each year.
 

The funded status of the plans is determined using appropriate
assumptions as of each year end.

Health
Care Cost Trend Assumptions

For
measurement purposes at
Dec. 31, 2005
, increases in the per
capita cost of covered health care benefits were assumed to be 9% for 2005 and
8% for 2006.
 
It is assumed the rate
will decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of 5% for 2009 and remain at that
level thereafter.

Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported
in the financial statements.
 
To
illustrate, a one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend
would have the following effects:

Contributions and Estimated Future Benefit Payments

In 2006, NS expects to
contribute approximately $8 million to its unfunded pension plans for payments
to
 pensioners and $44 million to
its other postretirement benefit plans for retiree health benefits.

Benefit
payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected
to be paid as follows:

Years
  2011-2015



Beginning in 2006, the other
benefit payments include an estimated annual $4 million reduction due to the
Medicare Part D Subsidy.

Other Postretirement Coverage

Under collective bargaining
agreements, NS and certain subsidiaries participate in a multi-employer

benefit plan, which provides certain postretirement health care and life
insurance benefits to eligible union employees.
 
Premiums under this plan are expensed as
incurred and amounted to $26 million in 2005, $20 million in 2004 and $18
million in 2003.

401(k) Plans

Norfolk
 Southern and certain
subsidiaries provide Section 401(k) savings plans for employees.
 
Under the plans, NS matches a portion of
employee contributions, subject to applicable limitations.
 
NS' expenses under these plans were $13
million in 2005, and $12 million in each of 2004 and 2003.

Stock-Based Compensation

Under
the stockholder-approved Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), a committee of
nonemployee directors of the Board or the chief executive officer (if delegated
such authority by the committee) may grant stock options, stock appreciation
rights (SARs), restricted shares, restricted stock units and performance share
units (PSUs), up to a maximum of 88,025,000 shares of Norfolk Southern Common
Stock (Common Stock).
 
Of these
shares, 5,000,000 were approved by the Board for issuance to non-officer
participants; as a broad-based issuance, stockholder approval was not required.
 
In May 2005, the stockholders approved
an amended LTIP which provided that 8,500,000 shares of stock previously
approved for issuance under LTIP could be granted as restricted shares,
restricted stock unit shares or performance shares.
 
Under the Board-approved Thoroughbred
Stock Option Plan (TSOP), the committee may grant stock options up to a maximum
of 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
 

Options may be granted for a term not to exceed 10 years, but may not be
exercised prior to the first anniversary of the date of grant.
 
Options are exercisable at the fair market
value of Common Stock on the date of grant.

The
LTIP also permits the payment – on a current or a deferred basis and in
cash or in stock – of dividend equivalents on shares of Common Stock
covered by options, PSUs or restricted stock units in an amount commensurate
with dividends paid on Common Stock.
 

Tax absorption payments also are authorized for any awards under LTIP in
amounts estimated to equal the federal and state income taxes applicable to
shares of Common Stock issued subject to a share retention agreement.

Accounting
Method

As
disclosed in Note 1, through
Dec. 31, 2005
, NS applied APB Opinion 25
and related interpretations in accounting for awards made under the plans.
 
Accordingly, grants of PSUs, restricted
shares, restricted share units, dividend equivalents, tax absorption payments
and SARs resulted in charges to net income, while grants of stock options had
no effect on net income.
 
Related
compensation costs were $75 million in 2005, $53 million in 2004 and $29
million in 2003.
 
NS recognized
additional paid-in capital of $47 million in 2005, $30 million in 2004 and
$2 million in 2003 related to the tax benefit generated by stock option
exercises.

Note
1 includes a table that illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per
share had NS applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to
stock-based employee compensation.

Derivative Financial Instruments

On
Jan. 1, 2001, NS adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(SFAS No. 133), as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities” (SFAS No. 138).
 

The Statements establish accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments and hedging activities, requiring that all derivatives
be recognized in the financial statements as either assets or liabilities and
that they be measured at fair value.
 
Changes in fair value are recorded as
adjustments to the assets or liabilities being hedged in “Other
comprehensive income,” or in current earnings, depending on whether the
derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting, the type of hedge
transaction represented and the effectiveness of the hedge.
 
The settlements of the hedges will
result in the reclassification into diesel fuel expense of the related gains or
losses recorded as a component of “Other comprehensive income.”

NS
uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its
diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates.
 
NS does not engage
in the trading of derivatives.
 

Management has determined that its derivative financial instruments
qualify as either fair-value or cash-flow hedges, having values that highly
correlate with the underlying hedged exposures, and has designated such
instruments as hedging transactions.
 

Credit risk related to the derivative financial instruments is
considered to be minimal and is managed by requiring high credit standards for
counterparties and periodic settlements.

Diesel
Fuel Hedging

NS has
hedged a portion of its diesel fuel consumption.
 
The intent of the hedges is to assist in
the management of NS' aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which
can significantly affect NS' operating margins and profitability.
 
In order to minimize this risk, NS has
entered into a series of swaps in order to lock in the purchase prices of some
of its diesel fuel.
 
Management has
designated these derivative instruments as cash-flow hedges of the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows attributable to fluctuations in
diesel fuel prices.

Following
is a summary of NS' diesel fuel swaps:

  into during the year

2 heating oil

n/a

$0.86

NS
has 4% of
estimated 2006 future diesel
fuel consumption covered as of
Dec. 31, 2005
..

Hedges
are entered into periodically by competitive bid among selected counterparties;
however, no hedges have been placed since May 2004.
 
The goal of this hedging strategy is to
reduce the variability of fuel costs over an extended period of time while
minimizing the incremental cost of hedging.
 
The program provides that NS will not
enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and
that no more than 80% of NS' average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged
for each month within any 36-month period.
 

After taking into account the effect of the hedging, diesel fuel costs
represented 11% of NS' operating expenses for the year ended
Dec. 31, 2005
, 8% for the year ended
Dec.
 31, 2004
, and 7% for the year ended
Dec. 31,
..

NS'
fuel hedging activity resulted in decreases in diesel fuel expenses of $148
million, $140 million and $59 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.
 
Ineffectiveness, or
the extent to which changes in the fair value of the heating oil contracts do
not offset changes in the fair values of the expected diesel fuel transactions,
was a $5 million expense in 2005, a $5 million benefit in 2004 and less than a
$1 million benefit in 2003.

Interest
Rate Hedging

NS
manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both
fixed and floating-rate debt instruments, and by entering into interest rate
hedging transactions.
 
NS had $116
million, or 1.7%, and $151 million, or 2.2%, of its fixed rate debt portfolio
hedged as of
Dec. 31, 2005
, and
Dec. 31, 2004
, respectively, using interest rate swaps that
qualify for and are designated as fair-value hedge transactions.
 
NS’ interest rate hedging activity
resulted in decreases in interest expenses of $2 million, $6 million and
$10 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 
These swaps have been effective in
hedging the changes in fair value of the related debt arising from changes in
interest rates and there has been no impact on earnings resulting from
ineffectiveness associated with these derivative transactions.

Fair
Values

The
fair values of NS' diesel fuel derivative instruments as of
Dec. 31, 2005
 and 2004 were determined based upon current market
values as quoted by an independent third party.
 
Fair values of interest rate swaps were
determined based upon the present value of expected future cash flows
discounted at the appropriate implied spot rate from the spot rate yield curve.
 
Fair value adjustments are noncash transactions
and, accordingly, are excluded from the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows.
 
“Accumulated other
comprehensive loss,” a component of “Stockholders' equity,”
included unrealized gains of $20 million (pretax) as of Dec. 31, 2005, and $75
million (pretax) as of Dec. 31, 2004, related to the fair value of derivative
fuel hedging transactions that will terminate within twelve months of the
respective dates.
 
Any future gain
or loss actually realized will be based on the fair value of the derivative fuel
hedges at the time of termination.

instruments were as follows:

, NS sold all the common stock of North American Van
Lines, Inc.
 
(NAVL), its motor
carrier subsidiary.
 
Results in 2003
include an additional after-tax gain of $10 million, or 3 cents per share

Commitments and Contingencies

Lawsuits

Norfolk
 Southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in
numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations.
 
When management concludes that it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can
be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to earnings.
 
While the ultimate amount of liability
incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future
developments, in management's opinion, the recorded liability is adequate to
cover the future payment of such liability and claims.
 
However, the final outcome of any of
these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable
or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be
significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.
 
Any adjustments to the recorded
liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such
adjustments are known.

NS
has been involved in mass tort litigation proceedings arising out of historic
flooding events that occurred in
West Virginia
 in 2001.
 

During the third quarter, one of NS’ subsidiaries was identified
as the target defendant for claims related to a specific sub-watershed.
 
The final outcome of these proceedings
is inestimable at this time.
 

Although NS has good defenses to the litigation, an unexpected adverse
resolution could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in
a particular quarter or fiscal year.

Casualty
Claims

Casualty
claims include employee personal injury and occupational claims as well as
third-party claims, all exclusive of legal costs.
 
NS engages an independent consulting
actuarial firm to aid in valuing its liability for these claims.
 
Job-related accidental injury and
occupational claims are subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act
(FELA), which is applicable only to railroads.
 
FELA’s fault-based system produces
results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault
workers’ compensation system.
 

The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs
being very different from the liability recorded.
 
While the ultimate amount of claims
incurred is dependent on future developments, in management’s opinion,
the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payments of claims and
is
support
ed by the most recent actuarial study.
 
In all cases, NS records a liability
when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable.

In
2005, NS recorded a liability related to the
Jan. 6, 2005
 derailment in
Graniteville
,
SC.
 
The
liability, which includes a current and long-term portion, represents NS’
best estimate based on current facts and circumstances.
 
The estimate includes amounts related to
business property damage and other economic losses, personal injury and
individual property damage claims as well as third-party response costs.
 
NS’ commercial insurance policies
are expected to cover substantially all expenses related to this derailment
above NS’ self-insured retention, including NS’ response costs and
legal fees.
 
Accordingly, the
Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a current and long-term receivable for
estimated recoveries from NS’ insurance carriers.
 
The $41 million expense recorded in 2005
related to this incident represents NS’ retention under its insurance
policies and other uninsured costs.
 

While it is reasonable to expect that the liability for covered losses
could differ from the amount recorded, such a change would be offset by a
corresponding change in the insurance receivable.
 
As a result, NS does not believe that it
is reasonably likely that its net loss (the difference between the liability
and future recoveries) will be materially different than the loss recorded in
2005.
 
NS expects at this time that
insurance coverage is adequate to cover potential claims and settlements above
its self-insurance retention.

Employee personal injury claims

– The largest component of casualties and other
claims expense is employee personal injury costs.
 
The actuarial firm engaged by NS
provides quarterly studies to aid in valuing its employee personal injury
liability and estimating its employee personal injury expense.
 
The actuarial firm studies NS’
historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking
into account relevant outside influences.
 

The actuary uses the results of these analyses to estimate the ultimate
amount of the liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted
claims.
 
NS adjusts its liability to
the actuarially determined amount on a quarterly basis.
 
The estimate of loss liabilities is
subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events
such as jury decisions, court interpretations or legislative changes and as
such the actual loss may vary from the actuarial estimate.

Occupational claims

– Occupational claims (including asbestosis and
other respiratory diseases, as well as repetitive motion) are often not caused
by a specific accident or event but rather result from a claimed exposure over
time.
 
Many such claims are being
asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been
employed in the rail industry for decades.
 

The actuarial firm provides an estimate of the occupational claims
liability based upon NS’ history of claim filings, severity, payments and
other pertinent facts.
 
The
liability is dependent upon management’s judgments made as to the
specific case reserves as well as judgments of the consulting actuarial
firm in the periodic studies.
 
The
actuarial firm’s estimate of ultimate loss includes a provision for those
claims that have been incurred but not reported.
 
This provision is derived by analyzing
industry data and projecting NS’ experience into the future as far as can
be reasonably determined.
 
NS
adjusts its liability to the actuarially determined amount on a quarterly
basis.
 
However, it is possible that
the recorded liability may not be adequate to cover the future payment of
claims.
 
Adjustments to the
recorded liability are reflected in operating expenses in the periods in which
such adjustments become known.

Third-party claims

– NS records a liability for third-party claims
including those for highway crossing accidents, trespasser and other injuries,
automobile liability, property damage and lading damage.
 
The actuarial firm assists with the
calculation of potential liability for third-party claims, except lading
damage, based upon NS’ experience including number and timing of
incidents, amount of payments, settlement rates, number of open claims and
legal defenses.
 
The actuarial
estimate includes a provision for claims that have been incurred but have not
yet been reported.
 
Each quarter NS
adjusts its liability to the actuarially determined amount.
 
Given the inherent uncertainty in regard
to the ultimate outcome of third-party claims, it is possible that future
settlement costs may differ from the estimated liability recorded.

Environmental Matters

NS
is subject to various jurisdictions' environmental laws and regulations.
 
It is NS' policy to record a liability
where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated
reasonably.
 
Claims, if any, against
third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as
receivables (when collection is probable) on the balance sheet and are not
netted against the associated NS liability.
 
Environmental engineers regularly participate
in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary
adjustments to liability estimates.
 

NS also has an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior
managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy.

NS'
Consolidated Balance Sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in
the amount of $58 million at
Dec. 31,
,
and $64 million at
Dec. 31, 2004
 (of which $12 million was
accounted for as a current liability at Dec. 31, 2005 and 2004).
 
At
Dec. 31,
,
the liability represented NS' estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation
costs based on available information at 189 known locations.
 
On that date, 16 sites accounted for $30
million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be
material.
 
NS anticipates that much
of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be
paid out over a longer period.

At
some of the 189 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with
a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible
parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state
authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint
and several liability for cleanup costs.

With
respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or
comparable state authorities), estimates of NS' ultimate potential financial
exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily
imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available
cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies,
the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of
contamination and each potential participant's share of any estimated loss
(and that participant's ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and
regulatory standards governing liability.

The
risk of incurring environmental liability – for acts and omissions, past,
present and future - is inherent in the railroad business.
 
Some of the commodities in NS' traffic
mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special
risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize.
 
In addition, several NS subsidiaries own,
or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased and operated
by others, or held for sale.
 

Because environmental problems may exist on these properties that are
latent or undisclosed, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental
liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and
materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time.
 
Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving
these and potentially other unidentified environmental sites and matters are
likely to arise from time to time.
 

The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

However,
based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, management
believes that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with
those environmental matters of which the Corporation is aware.
 
Further, management believes that it is
unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will
have a material adverse effect on NS' financial position, results of operations
or liquidity.

Insurance

NS
obtains on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries commercial insurance for
potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property
damages.
 
Specified levels of risk
are retained on a self-insurance basis (up to $25 million per occurrence for
bodily injury and property damage to third parties and $12.5 million per
occurrence for property owned by NS or in NS’ care, custody or control).

Purchase
Commitments

NSR
had outstanding purchase commitments of approximately $341 million in
connection with its 2006 and 2007 capital programs, including 133 locomotives
in 2006 and 63 locomotives in 2007.
 

In addition,
Norfolk
 Southern has committed to
purchase telecommunications services totaling $17 million through 2007.

Change-In-Control
Arrangements

Norfolk
 Southern has compensation
agreements with officers and certain key employees that become operative only
upon a change in control of the Corporation, as defined in those
agreements.
 
The agreements provide
generally for payments based on compensation at the time of a covered
individual's involuntary or other specified termination and for certain other
benefits.

Guarantees

In
a number of instances, NS and its subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify lenders
for additional costs they may bear as a result of certain changes in laws or
regulations applicable to their loans.
 

Such changes may include impositions or modifications with respect to
taxes, duties, reserves, liquidity, capital adequacy, special deposits, and
similar requirements relating to extensions of credit by, deposits with, or the
assets or liabilities of such lenders.
 

Similar provisions exist in NS' accounts receivable sales program.
 
The nature and timing of changes in laws
or regulations applicable to NS' financings are inherently unpredictable, and
therefore NS' exposure in connection with the foregoing indemnifications cannot
be quantified.
 
No liability has
been recorded related to these indemnifications.
 
In the case of one type of equipment
financing, NSR's Japanese leveraged leases, NSR may terminate the leases and
ancillary agreements if such a change-in-law indemnity is triggered.
 
Such a termination would require NSR to
make early termination payments that would not be expected to have a material
adverse effect on NS' financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

NS
has indemnified parties in a number of transactions for
U.S.
 income tax withholding
imposed as a result of changes in
U.S.
 tax law.
 
In all cases, NS has the right to unwind
the related transaction if the withholding cannot be avoided in the
future.
 
Because these indemnities
would be triggered and are dependent upon a change in the tax law, the maximum
exposure is not quantifiable.
 

Management does not believe that it is likely that it will be required
to make any payments under these indemnities.

NS
has outstanding warranty liabilities primarily related to work performed at its
locomotive facilities.
 
NS has
recorded a reserve of less than $1 million as of
Dec.
 31, 2005
, and 2004, for these warranties.

As
of
Dec. 31, 2005
, certain
Norfolk
 Southern subsidiaries are
contingently liable as guarantors with respect to $8 million of
indebtedness of an entity in which they have an ownership interest, the
Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis, due in 2019.
 
Six other railroads are also jointly and
severally liable as guarantors for this indebtedness.
 
No liability has been recorded related
to this guaranty.

Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

Norfolk Southern’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the
effectiveness of NS' disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of December 31, 2005.
 
Based on such evaluation, such officers
have concluded that, as of
Dec. 31,
, NS' disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
alerting them on a timely basis to material information relating to NS
(including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in NS'
periodic filings under the Exchange Act.

Internal Control over
Financial Reporting

The management of
Norfolk

Southern is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting.
 

The Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the Corporation’s
ability to record, process, summarize and report reliable financial data.
 
Management recognizes that there are
inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the
circumvention or overriding of internal control.
 
Accordingly, even effective internal
control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation.
 
Further, because of changes in
conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may
vary over time.

In order to ensure that the
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective,
management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its
financial reporting as of
Dec. 31,
..
 
This assessment
was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial
reporting set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

.
 

Based on our assessment, management has concluded that the Corporation
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
Dec. 31, 2005
..

The Board of Directors,
acting through its Audit Committee, is responsible for the oversight of the Corporation's
accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control.
 
The Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors is comprised entirely of outside directors who are independent of
management.
 
The independent
registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have full and
unlimited access to the Audit Committee, with or without management, to discuss
the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, and any other
matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the Audit
Committee.

Norfolk Southern’s
management has issued a report of its assessment of internal control over
financial reporting, and Norfolk Southern’s independent registered public
accounting firm has issued a report on this assessment.
 
These reports appear in Part II, Item 8
of this report on Form 10-K.

During the fourth quarter
of 2005, management has not identified any changes in NS' internal controls
over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, NS’ internal control over financial
reporting.

Norfolk

Southern Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan
(“LTIP”)

Established on
June 28, 1983
, and approved by stockholders at their Annual Meeting
held on
May 10, 1984
, LTIP was
adopted to promote the success of
Norfolk
 Southern by providing an opportunity for non-employee
directors, officers and other key employees to acquire a proprietary interest
in the Corporation.
 
 
On
Jan. 23, 2001
, the Board of Directors further amended the plan and
approved the issuance of an additional 5,000,000 shares of authorized but
unissued Common Stock under LTIP to participants who are not officers of
Norfolk
 Southern.  The issuance of these shares was
broadly-based, and stockholder approval of these shares was not required.
 Accordingly, this portion of LTIP is included in the number of securities
available for future issuance for plans not approved by stockholders.
 Also on
Jan. 23, 2001
, the Board adopted an amended plan, which was
approved by shareholders on
May 10, 2001
, that included the reservation for issuance of an additional
30,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Norfolk Southern Common
Stock.

Pursuant to another amendment
approved by stockholders on
May 12, 2005
, not more than 8.5 million of the shares remaining available for
issuance under the plan may be awarded as restricted shares, performance shares
or restricted stock unit shares.
 

Cash payments of restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and
performance share units will not be applied against the maximum number of

shares issuable under the
plan.
 
Any shares of Common Stock
subject to options, performance share units or restricted stock units which are
not issued as Common Stock will again be available for award under the plan
after the expiration or forfeiture of an award.

Non-employee directors,
officers and other key employees residing in the
United States
 or
Canada
 are eligible for selection to receive LTIP
awards.
 
Under LTIP, the
Compensation Committee (Committee) may grant incentive stock options,
nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares,
restricted stock units and performance share units (in addition, dividend
equivalents may be awarded for options, restricted stock units and performance
share units). The Committee may establish such terms and conditions for the
awards as provided in the plan.

For options, the option price
per share will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of
Norfolk
 Southern's Common Stock on the effective date the
option is granted.   All options are subject to a vesting period of at
least one year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten years.
 LTIP specifically prohibits option repricing without stockholder
approval, except for capital adjustments.

Performance share units
entitle a recipient to receive performance-based compensation at the end of a
three-year performance cycle based on
Norfolk
 Southern’s performance during that three-year
period.  For the 2005 performance share unit awards, corporate performance
will be measured using three equally weighted standards established by the
committee: (1) three-year average return on average capital invested, (2)
three-year average operating ratio and (3) three-year total return to
stockholders.  Performance share units may be payable in either shares of
Norfolk Southern Common Stock or cash.

Restricted
stock units are payable in cash or in shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock
at the end of a restriction period of not less than 36 months and not more than
60 months.
 
During the restriction
period, the holder of the restricted stock units has no beneficial ownership
interest in the Norfolk Southern Common Stock represented by the restricted
stock units and has no right to vote the shares represented by the units or to
receive dividends (except for dividend equivalent rights that may be awarded
with respect to the restricted stock units).
 
Restricted stock units will be forfeited
immediately if the holder leaves the continuous employment of
Norfolk
 Southern before the end of
the restriction period, unless such employment is terminated by reason of
retirement, disability or death or unless the restrictions are waived by
Norfolk
 Southern.

Norfolk

Southern Corporation
Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan

The
Board adopted the Norfolk Southern Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan
(“TSOP”) on Jan. 26, 1999, to promote the success of Norfolk
Southern by providing an opportunity for nonagreement employees to acquire a
proprietary interest in Norfolk Southern and thereby to provide an additional
incentive to nonagreement employees to devote their maximum efforts and skills
to the advancement, betterment, and prosperity of Norfolk Southern and its
stockholders.
 
The plan has not been
and is not required to have been approved by stockholders.
 
Six million shares of authorized but
unissued Common Stock were reserved for issuance under TSOP.

Active
full-time nonagreement employees residing in the
United States
 or
Canada
 are eligible for selection
to receive TSOP awards.
 
Under TSOP,
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may grant
nonqualified stock options subject to such terms and conditions as
provided in the plan.

The
option price will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of
Norfolk
 Southern's Common Stock on
the effective date the options are granted.
 
All options are subject to a vesting
period of at least one year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten
years.
 
TSOP specifically prohibits
option repricing without stockholder approval, except for capital adjustments.

Norfolk

Southern Corporation
Directors' Restricted Stock Plan

The
Norfolk Southern Corporation Directors' Restricted Stock Plan
(“Plan”) was adopted on
Jan. 1,
,
and is designed to increase ownership of Norfolk Southern Common Stock by its
non-employee directors so as to further align their ownership interest in
Norfolk
 Southern with that of
stockholders.
 
The Plan has not been
and is not required to have been approved by stockholders.
 
Currently, a maximum of 66,000 shares of
Corporation Common Stock may be granted under the Plan.
 
To make grants to eligible directors,
Norfolk
 Southern purchases, through
one or more subsidiary companies, the number of shares required in open-market
transactions at prevailing market prices, or makes such grants from Norfolk
Southern Common Stock already owned by one or more of
Norfolk
 Southern's subsidiary
companies.

Only
non-employee directors who are not and never have been employees of
Norfolk
 Southern are eligible to
participate in the Plan.
 
Upon
becoming a director, each eligible director receives a one-time grant of 3,000
restricted shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock.
 
No individual member of the Board
exercises discretion concerning the eligibility of any director or the number
of shares granted.

The
restriction period applicable to restricted shares granted under the plan begins
on the date of the grant and ends on the earlier of the recipient’s death
or six months after the recipient ceases to be a director by reason of
disability or retirement.
 
During
the restriction period shares may not be sold, pledged or otherwise
encumbered.
 
Directors will forfeit
the restricted shares if they cease to serve as a director of
Norfolk
 Southern for reasons other than
their disability, retirement or death.
