COAL

–

Coal is our largest commodity group as measured by revenues.

Revenues from coal accounted for about

26%

of our total railway operating revenues in


.

We handled a total of

156.1

million tons

, or

1.4

million carloads,

in


, mo

st of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins

,

with the balance from major western coal basins via Memphis and Chicago gate

ways.

Our coal franchise supports

the electric generation market, serving approximately 100 coal generation pla

nts, as well as the export, metallurgical and industrial markets primarily through direct rail and river, lake, and coastal facilities, including various terminals on the Ohio River

,

GENERAL MERCHANDISE

–

Our general merchandise market group

is composed of f

ive major commodity groupings:

chemicals;

agriculture, consumer products and government

; metals and construction

; automotive; and paper, clay and forest products.

•

Chemicals

includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleachin

g compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes, and municipal wastes.

•

A

griculture, consumer products, and government includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer,

livestock

and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods,

sweeteners, consumer products, ethanol, and items for the military.

•

M

swagen, and auto parts for Chrysler, Ford

, General Motors, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, a

nd Toyota.

•

P

aper

, clay and forest products

includes lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood fibers, wood pulp, scrap paper, and clay.

In


,


million tons of general merchandise freight, or approximately

65%

of total general merchandise tonnage

we handled

, originated online.

The balance of general merchandise

freight

was received from connecting carriers at interterritorial gateways.

Our

p

rincipal interchange points for received freight

included

Chicago,

New Orleans, East St. Louis, Memphis, Buffalo, and Detroit

.

General merchandise carloads handled in


were

2.3

million, the revenues from which accounted for

54%

of

our

to

tal railway operating revenues.

See the discussion of

general merchandise revenues

by commodity group in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

INTERMODAL

–

Our

intermodal market

group

co

nsists of shipments moving in trailers, domestic and international containers, and RoadRailer® equipment.

These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers, and other shippers.

Intermodal uni

ts handled in


were

3.4

million, the revenues from which accounted for

20%

of

our

total railway operating revenues.

See th

e discussion of intermodal revenues

in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

FREIGHT RATES

–

In


, we continued our reliance on priv

ate contracts and exempt price quotes as the predominant pricing mechanisms.

Thus, a major portion of our freight business is not currently economically regulated by the government.

In general, market forces have been substituted for government regulatio

n and now are the primary determinant of rail service prices.

In


,

our

railroads were found by the

Surface Transportation Board (

STB

), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices,

to be “revenue adeq

uate”

on an annual basis

based on results for the year


.

The STB has not made its revenue adequacy determination for the year


.

A railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable

law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital.

This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement.

Microwave System

–

Our

microwave system, consisting of approximately

radio route miles,


core stations,


secondary stations, and four

passive repeater stations, provides communications be

tween most operating locations.  We use the microwave system

primarily for voice communications, VHF radio control circuits, data and facsimile transmissions, traffic

control operations, and AEI data transmissions.

Traffic Control

–

Of the approximately

16,500

route miles

we

dispatch, about

11,025

miles are signalized, including

8,150

mile

s of centralized traffic control (CTC) and

2,875

miles of automatic block signals.

Of the

8,150

miles of CTC, approximately

5,100

miles are controlled by data radio originati

ng at


base station radio sites.

Computers

–

A computer network consisting of a centralized production and backup data center

near

Atlanta, Georgia, and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards, terminals, transportation offices, rolling stock repair points, sales offi

ces, and other key system locations.

Operating and traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the system.

Computer systems provide current information on the location of every train and each

car on line, as well as related waybill and other train and car movement data.

In addition,

our

computer systems assist

us

in the performance of a

K


variety of functions and services including payroll, car and revenue accounting, billing, material managemen

t activities and controls, and special studies.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

–

Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is a princip

al goal

of ours

.

To date, such compliance

has not had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations

, liquidity, or competitive position.

See “Legal Proceedings,” Part I, Item 3; “Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities”

in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

–

In addition to environmental, safety, securities, and other regulations generall

y applicable to all business, our

railroads are subject to regulation by the STB.

The STB has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.

The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or ac

quisition of control of and by rail common carriers.

The Federal Railroad Administration

(FRA)

regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards.

The relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, following the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, includ

ed exemption from STB regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business (trailer-on-flat-car, container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar shipments, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pu

lpwood, and wood chips for paper manufacturing.  Further, all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from regulation for the duration of the contract.  About 86% of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving

under transportation contracts; the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates.

Efforts

have been made over the past several years

to re-subject the rail industry to increased federal economic regulation

,

and such efforts are expected to continue in 201


.

The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially balanced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate, invest in their infrastructure, and compete for business, thereby contributi

ng to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry.

Accordingly,

we

will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation.

Government regulations concerning the safety and security of our railroads are

discussed within the “Security of Operations” section contained herein.

COMPETITION

–

There is continuing strong competition among rail, water, and highway carriers.

Price is usually only

one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company. Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerati

ons, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and consumer products.

Even for raw materials, s

emi-finished goods, and work-in-

progress, users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive producti

on stages.

K


Our

primary rail competitor is CSX

Corporation

; both

railroads

operate throughout much of the same territory.

Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory.

We

also compete with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers who h

ave the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage, sourcing products from different geographic areas, and using substitute products.

Certain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable

railroads

to compete more effectively in specific markets.

SECURITY OF OPERATIONS

–

We

ha

ve

taken significant steps to provide enhanced s

ecurity for our rail system.

In particular,

we have

developed and implemented a comprehensive security plan that is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11, 2001.

The AAR Security Plan defines four Alert Le

vels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as

a

terrorist threat increases or decreases.

The Alert Level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas:

(1) operations

(including transportation, engineering, and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and, (3) railroad police.

Although security concerns preclude public disclosure of its contents,

our

System

Security Plan outlines the protocol within

our company

for all concerned to be notified of AAR Alert Level changes.

All

of our

Operations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional responsibilities they

may incur due to such change.

Our

plan also effectively addresses and complies with

U.S.

Department of Transportation

(DOT)

security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials.

As part

of the plan, security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety, and this training is integrated into recurring hazardous material training and re-certification programs.

Toward tha

t end,

we

, working closely with the National Transit Institute at Rutgers University, ha

ve

developed a four-module uniform national training program.

We

ha

ve

also

worked with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in developing other industry tr

aining programs.

More in-depth security training has been given to select employees

of ours

who have been given specific security responsibilities, and additional, location-specific security plans have been developed for certain metropolitan areas and eac

h of

the

six port facilities

we

serve.

With respect to the ports, each facility plan has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port and

is

subject to inspection by the U.S. Coast Guard.

Additionally,

we

engage in close and regular coordination

with numerous federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the TSA, the Federal Bureau o

f Investigation (FBI), the FRA

, the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and various state Homeland Security o

ffices.

As one notable example,

one of our

Police Special Agent

s

in Charge (SAC), under the auspices of the AAR, has been assigned to the National Joint Terrorism Task Force (NJTTF) operated by the FBI, and located at the National Counter Terrorism Center

(NCTC) in Arlington, V

irginia

to represent and serve as liaison to the North American rail industry.

This arrangement improves logistical flow of vital security and law enforcement information with respect to the rail industry as a whole, while

having th

e post filled by one of our

SAC

s

has also served to foster a strong working relationship between

us

and the FBI.

We

also ha

ve

become a member of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) prog

ram sponsored by U.S. Customs.

C-TPAT allows

us

to work closely with U.S. Customs and

our

customers to develop measures that will help ensure the integrity of freight shipments moving on

our railroads

, particularly those moving to or from a foreign country.

Based on participation in C-TPAT,

we

ha

ve

ens

ured that

our

plan meets all current applicable security recommendations made by U.S. Customs.

Similarly,

we are

guided in

our

operations by various supplemental security

action items issued by DHS and

DOT, U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Security requirements,

as well as voluntary security action items developed in collaboration with TSA, DOT, and the freight railroads. Many of the action items are based on lessons learned from DHS and DOT security assessments of rail corridors in High Threat Urban Areas (HTUA)

. Particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in HTUA by:

(1) the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) materials; (2) the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying TIH materials; (3)

the minimization of unattended loaded tank cars carrying TIH materials; and (4) cooperation with

K


federal, state, local and tribal governments to identify, through risk assessments, those locations where security risks are the highest.

These action items a

nd

our

compliance initiatives are outlined in the vario

us departmental sections of our

System

Security Plan.

We

ha

ve

taken appropriate actions to be compliant with the TSA Final Security Rule addressing Rail Security Sensitive Materials (RSSM) to ensure t

hese shipments are properly inspected and that positive chain-of-custody is maintained when required.

We are

in compliance with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) rail-routing regulations outlined in Docket HM-232E.

We

con

duct ongoing route evaluations.

In 2011,

as part of the FRA’s bi-annual review,

this metho

dology and selected routes were

found to be compliant with the regulation

.  The next review by the FRA is expected mid-year 2013.

In


, th

rough participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response (TRANSCAER) Program,

we

provided rail accident response training to approximately

5,087

emergency responders, such as local police and fire pers

onnel, representing over

19,023

hours of emergency response training.

We

also conducted railroad operations classes for FBI agents and the railroad liaison agents from NJTT

F and participated

in

four

drills for local, state, and

federal agencies.

We

also ha

ve

ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the Security and Emergency Response Training Course conducted at the AAR Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado.

Improvements in equipment design also are expected to play a role in enhancing rail security.

PHMSA, in coordination with the FRA,

has

amend

ed

the Hazardous Materials Regulations to prescribe enhanced safety for rail transportation of TIH materials,

has p

rovided

interim design standards for railroad tank cars.

The rule mandates commodity-specific improvements in safety features and design standards for newly manufactured DOT specification tank cars and an improved top fittings performance standard.

The i

nterim standards established in this rule will enhance the accident survivability of TIH tank cars.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

We are

subject to significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial, operating and environmental matters.

Railroads are subject to the enactment of laws by Congress that could increase economic regulation of the industry.

Railroads presently

are subject to commercial regulation by the STB, which has jurisdiction over some rates

,

routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.

The STB also has jurisdiction over

the

c

onsolidation, merger, or acqui

sition

of control of and by

rail common carriers.

Additional economic regulation of the rail industry by Congre

ss or the STB, whether under new or existing laws, could have a significant negative impact on

our

ability to determine prices for rail services

and result in a material adverse effect in the future on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

This potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on

our

rail network

or abandonment of lines.

Railroads are subject to safet

y and security regulation by

DOT and DHS, which regulate most aspects of

our

operations.

Compliance with the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 will result in additional operating costs associated

with the statutorily mandated implementation of positive train control by 2015.

In addition to increased capital expenditures, implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels, as well as increased compensation and benefits e

xpenses, and increased claims and litigation costs.

Our

operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies; handlin

g, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases.

The risk of incurring environmental liability

–

for acts and omissions, past, present, and future

–

is inherent in the rail

road business.

This risk includes property owned by

us

, whether currently or in the past, that is or has been subject to a variety of uses, including

our

railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or

our

past and present tenants.

Environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, and

we

could incur environmental liabilities or costs, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time,

K


with respect to one or more of these

properties.

Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time, and the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, o

r liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

A

s a common carrier by rail,

we

must offer to transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk.

T

ransportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and pr

operty damage costs, and compromise critical parts of our rail network.

We

may be affected by terrorism or war.

Any terrorist attack, or other similar event, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war could cause significant business interru

ption and may adversely affect

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

Because

we

play a critical role in the nation’s transportation system,

we

could become the target of such an attack or have a signi

ficant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war.

Although

we

currently maintain insurance coverage for third-party liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism,

we

maintain only limited insurance coverage for firs

t-party property damage and damage to property in

our

care, custody, or control caused by certain acts of terrorism.

In addition, premiums for some or all of

our

current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically, or insurance co

verage for certain losses could be unavailable to

us

in the future.

We

may be affected by general economic conditions.

Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities

we

carr

y

may have an adverse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity

in a particular year or quarter

.

Economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a significant impact on

our

financial posit

ion, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

We

may be affected by climate change legislation or regulation.

Concern over climate change has led to significant federal, state, and international legislative and regulatory effo

rts to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Moreover, even without such legislation or regulation, government incentives and adverse publicity relating to GHGs could affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry.

Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on GHG emissions, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase

our

operating costs, decrease the amount of traffic handled, and decrease the value of coal reserves

we own

, and thus could have an adve

rse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity

in a particular year or quarter

.

Such restrictions could affect

our

customers that (1) use commodities that

we

carr

y

to produce energy, including coal, (2) use significant amounts o

f energy in producing or delivering the commodities

we

carr

y

, or (3) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy.

We

face competition from other transportation providers.

We are

subject to competition

from motor carriers, railroads

and

,

to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and pipelines, on the basis of tr

ansit time, pricing, and

quality and reliability of service.

While

we

ha

ve

used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain

our

rail

system, trucks and barges have been able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities.

Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in wh

ich

we

operate, or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations, could have a material adverse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or q

uarter.

The operations of carriers with which

we

interchange may adversely affect

our

operations.

Our

ability to provide rail service to customers in the U.S. and Canad

a depends in large part upon our

ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to, among other matters, freight rates, revenue division, car supply and locomotive availability, data exchange and communications, reciprocal switching, interchange, and

trackage rights. Deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers, or in

our

relationship with those connecting carriers, could result in

our

inability to meet

our

customers’ demands or require

us

to use alternate train routes,

which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies.

K


We

rel

y

on technology and technology improvements in

our

business operations.

If

we

experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of

our

information technology

systems, including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment,

we

could experience a service interruption,

a

security breach, or other operational difficulties

.

Additionally, if

we

do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or

we

are

unable to implement new technology,

we

may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service

.  Any of these factors

could have a material adverse effect on

our

financial po

sition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

The vast majority of

our

employees belong to labor unions, and labor agreements, strikes, or work stoppages could adversely affect

our operations.

More than

80% of

our

railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.

If unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown,

we

could experience a significant disruption of

our

operations.

Additionally

, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could significantly increase

our

costs for healthcare, wages, and other benefits.

Any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

We

may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.

The nature of

our

business exposes

us

to the potential for various cl

aims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, commercial disputes, freight loss and other property damage, and other matters.

Job-related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the Federal Employer’s Liability Act (

FELA), which is applicable only to railroads. FELA’s fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker’s compensation system.

The variability inherent in this system could result in actual

costs being very different from the liability recorded.

Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss  property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could have a

mate

rial adverse effect on our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance.

We

ha

ve

obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages.

Specified levels of ris

k are retained on a self-insurance basis (currently

up to $50 million and above $1 billion per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage to third parties and up to $25 million and above $175 million per occurrence for property owned by us or in our

care, custody, or control).

Insurance is available from a

limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to

us

.

Severe weather could result in significant business interruptions

and expenditures.

Severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including hurricanes, floods, fires, and earthquakes, may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues, whic

h could have an adverse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

Unpredictability of demand for rail services resulting in the unavailability of qualified personnel could adversely affect

our

o

perational efficiency and ability to meet demand.

Workforce demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and trainmen, could each have a negative impact on

our

ability to meet demand for rail ser

vice.

Unpredictable increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on

our

operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidi

ty in a particular year or quarter.

We

may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of

our

supplier markets.

We

consumed about 4


million gallons of diesel fuel in


.

Fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations.

A

severe fuel supply shortage

arising

from production curtailments, increased demand in existing

or emerging foreign markets, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to

K


refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or other factors,

could have a material adverse effect on our

financial position, resu

lts of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

Also, such an event

c

ould impact

us

as well as

our

customers and other transportation companies.

Due to the capital intensive nature and industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, high barriers of entry

exist

for potential new suppliers of core railroad items, such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment.

Additionally,

we

compete with o

ther industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials, such as rail and ties.

Changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited-supplier markets could result in increased prices or

significant

shor

tages of materials that could have a material

adverse e

ffect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

The state of capital markets could adversely affect

our

liquidity.

F

rom time-to-time

we

rel

y

on t

he capital markets to provide some of

our

capital requirements, including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper, as well as the sale of certain receivables.

Significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including

the credit markets, or deterioration of

our

financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate

our

access to, and/or significantly increase the cost of, various financing sources, including bank credit facilities and issua

nce of corporate bonds.

Instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of

our

financial condition, alone or in combination, could also result in a reduction in

our

credit rating to below investment grade, which could prohibit or restr

ict

us

from accessing external sources of short- and long-term debt financing and/or significantly increase the associated costs.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

Item 3. Legal

Proceedings

On November 6, 2007, various antitrust class actions filed against

us and other Class I

railroads in various Federal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in the District of Columbia by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.

On June

21, 2012, the court certified the case as a class action.  The defendant railr

oads have appealed such certification, and a decision by the court to either reject the appeal outright or proceed with ruling on its merits is pending.  We believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the cas

es.

We

do not believe the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

A lawsuit containing similar allegations against

us

and four other major railroads that was filed on March

25, 2008, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff subject to a tolling agreement entered into in August 2008.

We received a Notice of

Violation (NOV) issued by the Tennessee Department of Environmental Conservation concerning soil runoff in connection with construction of the Memphis Regional Intermodal Facility in Rossville, Tennessee.  Although we will contest liability and the imposi

tion of any penalties, this matter is described here consistent with SEC rules and requirements concerning governmental proceedings with respect to environmental laws and regulations.  We do not believe that the outcome of this proceeding will have a mater

ial effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Norfolk Southern Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analy

sis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and the Selected Financial Data.

OVERVIEW

We are one of the nation’s premier transportation companies.  Our Norfolk Southern Railway Company subsidiary operates appro

ximately

20,000

miles of road in


states and the District of Columbia, serves every major container port in the eastern United States, and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers.  We op

erate the most extensive intermodal network in the East and are a major transporter of coal, automotive, and industrial products.  In 2012, as part of our Crescent Corridor initiative, we opened the new Memphis Regional Intermodal Facility in Rossville, TN

as well as the new Birmingham Regional Intermodal Facility in McCalla, AL, in order to position ourselves to handle increased intermodal volumes faster and more reliably.

Financial results for


were adversely affected as utili

ty coal volumes declined, reflecting competition from low natural gas prices and reduced electrical demand in NS-served regions.  In addition, export coal average revenue per unit dropped, a result of market-based pricing pressure.  These decreases more th

an offset gains in our intermodal and merchandise sectors, resulting in a

1%

decline in r

ailway operating revenues

, which more than offset the 1% reduction in railway operating expenses.  As a result, t

he railway operating ratio (a

measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed

by operating expenses) rose

to

71.7%

, as compared with

71.2%

in


, and net income declined

9%

.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $

3.1

billion which, along with proceeds from borrowings

and cash on hand,

allowed for property additions, share repurchases, d

ividend payments, and debt

repayments

. During


,

we repurchased

18.8

million shares of Common Stock

at

a total cost of $

1.3

billion. Since inception of

our

stock repurchase program in 2006,

we have

repurchase

d and retired

128.4

million shares of Common Stock at a total cost of $

7.5

billion. At December 31,


, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $


million.

In


,

we

expect revenues to increase, reflecting higher volumes.

We

plan to continue to focus on safety,

cost control, increased productivity,

improv

ed

service

d

levels and operational efficiency, and a

n ongoing

market-based approach to pricing.

SUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Compared w

ith


Net income in


was $

1.7

billion, or $

5.37

per diluted share,

down

$


million, or

9%

, compared with $

1.9

billion, or $

5.45

per diluted share, in


.

The

de

crease in net income was due to

lower

income from railway operations

, l

ower

nonoperating income items, higher interest expense on debt, and a higher e

ffective income tax rate (Note 3).

Railway operating revenues de

creased

modestly,

$


m

illion, reflecting

low

er average revenue per u

nit, including fuel surcharges

.

Railway operating expenses

also decreased modestly, $43 milli

on, largely driven by the absence of the $58

million unfavorable arbitration ruling in 2011 and declines related to network efficiency and productivity gains, offset by higher depreciation and intermodal volume-related expenses.

Oil prices affect

our

resu

lts of operations in a variety of ways and can have an overall favorable or unfavorable impact in any particular period.

In addition to the impact of oil prices on general economic conditions and traffic volume, oil prices directly affect

our

revenues thr

ough market-based fuel surcharges and contract escalators (see “Railway Operating Revenues”) and also affect fuel costs (see “Railway Operating Expenses”).

For


, excluding the impact of

de

creased consumption, the increase in fue

l surcharge revenue was

less

than the increase in fuel expense.

Future changes in oil prices may cause volatility in operating results that could be material to a particular year or quarter.


Compared with


Net income in


was $

1.9

billion, or $

5.45

per diluted share, up $


million, or

28%

, compared with

$

1.5

billion, or $

4.00

per diluted share, in


.

The increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations

and a lower effective tax rate

(Note 3).

Railway operating r

evenues increased $

1.7

billion, reflecting higher average revenue per unit, including fuel surcharges

, and

higher volumes

.

Railway operating expenses increased $

1.1

billion,

primarily due to higher

fuel pr

ices and

volume-

related expenses

.

Many of our negotiated fuel surcharges for coal and general merchandise shipments are based on the monthly average price of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI Average Price).  These surcharges are reset the first day of each calendar month based on the WTI Average Price for the second preceding calendar month. This two-month lag in applying WTI Average Price increased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately $39 million in 2012, but decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately $44 million in 2011 and $28 million in 2010.

One of our customers, DuPont, has a rate reasonableness co

mplaint pending before

the STB alleging that

our

Since June 1, 2009,

we

been billing and collecting

from DuPont

amounts based on the challenged tari

ff rates.

We

presently expect resolution of the DuPont case to occur in 201

COAL

revenues

de

creased $


million, or

, compared with


, reflecting a

13%

de

crease in

carload

volume

primarily due to fewer shipments of utility coal.

Coal average revenue per unit was

down

5%

, the result of

lower pricing (mainly market-based export metallurgical coal) and decreased fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by the positive effect of changes in mix.

In


, coal revenues increased $


million,

or

27%

, compared with


, reflecting higher average revenue per unit and a

4%

increase in volume principally due to a rise in domestic and global steel production.

Coal average reve

nue per unit was up

22%

compared with


, reflecting

improved pricing and increased fuel surcharge revenue.

For


, coal revenues are expected to

Utility coal

tonnage

dropped

17%

in


,

reflecting competition from low natural gas prices and reduced electrical demand in NS-served regions.  Additional tonnage declines resulted from coal plant closures and plant maintenance.

In


, utility coal tonnage

improved a mo

dest

1%

, primarily a result of new business and the resumption in the first quarter of shipments to electrical generation units that had been i

dled in

2009.

These increases were tempered by the effects of increased natural gas generation due to low natura

l gas prices

,

reduced electrical demand in NS

-

served regions, and severe weather disruptions in 2011.

For


, we expect utility coal tonnage to

de

cre

ase, reflecting

the effects of

plant closures, continued low natural gas prices,

and higher-than-normal utility stockpiles.

Export coal

tonnage de

creased

1%

compared to


, a reflection of weaker global demand for metallurgical coal used in steel production in NS-served markets, in addition to the negative impact of the return of Australian supply, offset in part by increased thermal shipments.

Tonnage handled through Norf

1.3

million tons, or

,

whereas tonnage through Baltimore increased

0.3

million tons, or

4%

.  Other export tonnage handled increased 0.8 million

tons

.

In


, export coal tonnage increased

25%

compared with


, reflecting increased global demand for coal used in steel production

and tightened supply from Australia due to flo

Tonnage handled through Norfolk was up

4.7

million tons, or

30%

, and Baltimore tonnage handled increased

0.8

million tons, or


1%

.

For


, export coal tonnage is expected to

decrease as a result of sluggish demand from Europe partially offset by improvement in Asia beginning in the second half of 2013.

Domestic metallurgical coal

tonnage

was down

GENERAL MERCHANDISE

revenues in


increased $


million, or

6%

, compared with


, reflecting a

4%

rise in average revenue per unit as a result of higher rates and fuel surcharges.

Carload

volume

increased

2%

.

In


, general merchandi

se revenues increased $


million, or

12%

, compared with


, reflecting a

n

11%

rise in

average revenue per unit

as a result of higher rates and fuel surcharges.  Overall, carload vol

ume was relatively flat.

Chemicals

revenues in


increased

7%

, compared with


, reflecting

4%

growth in

volume

and a

3%

increase in average revenue per unit that resulted from

higher

rates and fuel surcharges

.

The volume

improvement

was primarily

the

result of

more carloads of crude oil from the Bakken and Canadian oil fields.  Additionally, there were more carloads of li

quefied petroleum gas, as well as higher shipments of plastics driven by greater demand for plastic bottles.  These increases were offset in part by fewer shipments of rock salt as a mild winter resulted in higher inventory levels throughout 2012

.

In


, chemicals revenue

s

grew

5%

, compared with


, as a

14%

increase in

average revenue per unit that resulted from higher rates and fuel surcharges more th

an offset the effects of an

8%

decrease in volume.  The decline in volume was primarily a result of reduced shipments of fly ash, due to the completion of the Tennessee Valley Authority ash project in the fourth quarter of 2010.

For


, chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase as a result of higher shipments of

crude oil, as well as more carloads of plastics linked to the projected resurgence of the housing market and continued growth in the automoti

ve market.

Additionally, average revenue per unit is expected to be higher.

Agriculture, consumer products, and government

revenues

were relatively flat

in


, compared with


,

as higher average revenue

per unit was offset by lower volume.  The volume decline was driven by reduced corn shipments (due to plant closures), fewer carloads of fertilizer (led by certain network classification changes), and reduced shipments of wheat to the eastern U.S. (due to

customer sourcing changes).  These volume declines were offset in part by more shipments of soybean and soybean meal due to a poor South American bean crop, as well as higher shipments of corn-based feed to Texas.

In


, agricult

ure, consumer products, and government revenues increased

9%

, compared with


,

the result of a

14%

i

mprovement

in average revenue per unit

, which reflected higher rates and fuel surc

harges.  Volume declined 5% as a result of fewer shipments of fertilizer due to certain network classification changes and reduced shipments of corn to the Midwest due to the impact of a healthier Midwest crop.

For


, agr

iculture, consumer products, and government revenues are expected to improve as a result of higher average revenue per unit

offset in part by a decrease in volume.  The projected decline in volume is primarily due to fewer shipments of feed and corn as a r

esult of the negative impact of the 2012 Midwest drought, in addition to fewer revenue movements of empty equipment, which is expected to be offset in part by more fertilizer carloads

.

Metals and construction

revenues increased

8%

in


, compared with


.

The revenue improvement resulted from

7%

higher average reve

nue per unit, which reflected higher rates and fuel surcharges.  V

olume improved

1%

, reflecting more coil steel shipments driven by increased automotive production.  The mild winter weather experienced in early and late 2012 led to more shipments of cement for construction projects.  There were also higher shipments of fractio

nating sand for natural gas drilling.  These increases were partially offset by fewer

K


aggregates carloads, primarily driven by weak market conditions in road/highway construction, and as lower coal utility burn led to fewer shipments of scrubber stone.

In


, metals and construction revenues increased

23%

, compared with


.  The improvement resulted from

16%

growth in

average revenue per unit

, which reflected

higher rates and fuel surcharges.  Volume improved

6%

, reflecting increased automotive production that led to more shipments of coil steel and more carloads of fractionating sand for natural gas drilling.

For


, metals and construction revenues are expected to

increase reflecting higher average revenue per unit and a modest increase in volume due to more shipments of fractionating sand and other materials as a result of expected

growth in the natural

gas

drilling sector.

Automotive revenues

rose

15%

, compared to


, reflecting

13%

growth in

volume due to increased

North American light vehicle production at NS-served plants

and a

2%

improvement in average revenue pe

r unit, including fuel surcharges

.

In


, automotive revenues rose

20%

, compared to


, reflecting a 14% rise in volume d

ue to increased domestic production of North American light vehicles and a 5% improvement in average revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains and higher fuel surcharges.

For


, automotive revenues are expected to

grow

as a result of volume gains driven by

a continued

increase in domestic production of North American light vehicles at

NS-served

plants, in addition to

slightly

higher average revenue per unit.

Paper, clay and forest products

revenues increased

3%

in


, compared with


, reflecting a

5%

improvement in average revenue per unit due to increased rates, which more than offset the effects of

a

3%

v

olume decline.

The

lower

volume was

due to reduced shipments of miscellaneous wood driven by the loss of business and fewer carloads of pulp as a result of declining export market demand.

In


, paper, clay, and forest products revenues increased

6%

, compared with


, reflecting an 11% improvement in average revenue per unit due to higher rates and fuel surcharges, which more than offset the effec

ts of a 4% volume decline.  The lower volume was principally due to fewer shipments of wood chips as drier weather in the Southeast prompted customer sourcing changes, in addition to the closure of a plant in the third quarter of 2011.  Reduced shipments o

f kaolin and newsprint associated with lower demand and the loss of some lower-rated business also impacted the year

.

For


, paper, clay, and forest produ

cts revenues are expected to increase reflecting higher volumes of lumber

as housing starts continue to improve, in addition to higher

average revenue per unit

.

INTERMODAL

revenues increased $


million, or

5%

, c

ompared with


, reflecting

5%

growth

in volume

largely due to increased domestic units resulting from continued highway-to-rail conversions.  Average revenue per unit improved

The

more favorable personal injury claims development for prior years’ claims ($34

million).  These favorable items were partially offset by

higher costs

associated

with property taxes and environmental remediation.

K


The increase in


reflected

the unfavorable arbitration ruling and higher costs associated with locomotive and railcar materials, taxes (primarily sales and use,

property, and excise), employee travel, and supply costs, as well as less favorable personal injury claims development.

The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect long-term receivables for estimated recoveries from our insurance carriers for claims associate

d with the January 6, 2005, derailment in Graniteville, S.C.

In the first quarter of 2011,

we

received an unfavorable ruling for an arbitration

claim with an insurance carrier

and w

ere

denied recovery of the contested portion of the claim.

As a result,

w

e

recorded a $43 million charge

for

the receivables associated with the contested portion of the claim and a $15 million charge for other receivables affected by the ruling for which recovery

was

no longer probable.

The largest component of casualties a

nd other claims expense is personal injury costs.

Cases involving occupational injuries comprised about

40%

of total employee injury cases resolved and about

25%

of total employee injury payments made.

With

our

long-established commitment to safety,

we

continue to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and reduce the associated costs.

With respect to occupational injuries, which are not caused by a specific accident or event but allegedly re

sult from a claimed exposure over time, the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately.

The majority of these types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively

employed

in the rail industry for decades.

The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job-related accidental injury and occupational claims because of the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads.

FELA’s fault-based system, which covers employee claims for job-related injuries, produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault workers’ compensation system.

We

maintain substantial amounts of insurance for potential third-party liability and property damage claims.

We

also retain reasonable levels of

risk through self-insurance (

Note 16).

Compensation and benefits

, which represents

37%

of total operating expenses,

de

creased $


million

in


, reflecting changes in

:

•

employee activity levels (

down

$


million),

•

incentive and stock-based compensation

(

down

$


million),

•

pay rates

(up $


3 million),

and

•

pension

and postretirement benefit costs

(up $1


million).

In


, compensation and benefits increased $


million, or

10%

, compared with



, primarily due to

higher:

•

agreement employee activity levels associated with increased volumes (up $70 million),

•

health and welfare benefit costs for agreement employees (up $50 million),

•

incentive compensation (up $39 million),

•

payroll taxes (up $37

million),

•

pension benefit costs (up $19 million), and

•

wage rates (up $16 million).

Our

employment averaged

30,943

in


, compared with

30,329

in


, and

28,559

in


.

The


increase was a result of

additional mechanical and maintenance of way personnel to support field operations.

Looking forward to



,

we

expect employment levels to be

lower

than


as we continue to benefit from productivity increases and operational efficiencies

.

We

also expect increased compensation and benefits costs as a result of higher wage rates

.

Fuel

expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fue

l used in railway operations, de

creased

$


million, or

1%

, in


,

but

increased $


million, or

47%

, in

The decline

in


was principally the result of

lower

fuel consumption (locomotive fuel consumption

,

which had an impact of $


million, offset in part by

higher fuel prices (locomotive fuel prices rose

The increase in


for p

urchased services costs

reflected higher professional and consulting fees, intermodal operations expenses, Conrail-related casualty costs ($15 million), and advertising expenses.  These increases were partially offset by lo

wer haulage expenses.

The increase in


was

principally driven by higher costs associated with

greater

volumes.

E

quipment rents, which includes

our

cost of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or pri

vate owners less the rent paid to

us

for the use of

our equipment, decreased in


as a result of increased velocity and improved equipment utilization, whereas the

.

Other Income – Net

Other income – n

et was $


million in


, $


million in


, and $


million in


(

Note 2).

The

decline

in


reflected

fewer gains on the sale of property, decreased coal royalties, and higher interest expense (net) on uncertain tax positions offset in part by higher net returns from corporate-owned life insurance (COLI), increased equity

in the earnings of Conrail, and higher rental income.  During the fourth quarter of 2012, we closed on the sale of certain assets to the Michigan Department of Transportation.  The associated gain on the sale has been deferred until we cease to have ongoin

g obligations associated with the assets, which is expected to occur within the next 12

months.

The increase in 201


reflected reduced interest expense (

net) on uncertain tax positions,

higher net

COLI returns

, and increase

d coal royalties

.

The increases

were offset in part by fewer gains on the sale of property and increased professional and legal fees associated with the third quarter debt exchange and the fourth quarter credit

facility renewal (up $7

.

K


Income Taxes

Income tax expense in


was $


billion, an effective rate of

37%

, compared

with

34%

in


and


%

in


.

The

increase in the rate for


primarily

reflects the absence of the prior year’s favorable resolution of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination of our 2008 return and review of cer

tain claims for refund ($40

million) and the absence of a favorable reduction in deferred tax expense for state law changes ($28

million).

The decrease in the rate for


was primarily due to the favorable

adjustments discussed ab

ove

and the absence of a 2010 charge to deferred tax expense ($27 million) due to a change in the tax law impacting the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy program.

These decreases were offset in part by the absence of a 2010 $34 million benefit resultin

g from a change in estimate

for

deferred taxes

.

Fifty-percent bonus depreciation was allowed for federal income taxes for 2010.  In December 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act increased bonus depreciation to

100 percent for the period September 2010 through the end of 2011 and allowed fifty-percent bonus depreciation in 2012.  The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was signed into law on January

2,

2013, extended fifty-percent bonus depreciation for a

n additional year.  While bonus depreciation does not affect our total provision for income taxes or effective rate, the absence of bonus depreciation after 2013 is expected to increase current income tax expense and the related cash outflows for the payme

nt of income taxes beginning in 2014.  The American Taxpayer Relief Act also reinstated certain business tax credits retroactively to January 1, 2012.  The effects of changes in tax laws, including retroactive changes, are recognized in the period in which

the changes are enacted.  Accordingly, we expect to recognize approximately $9

million of income tax benefits in the first quarter of 2013 for these tax law changes.

IRS examinations have been completed for all years prior to 2011.  We expect the IRS wil

l begin auditing our 2011 and 2012 consolidated income tax returns in late 2013.

We

also expect to spend $

to increase mainli

ne capacity, accommodate business

growth and provide ou

CREATE project

.

Technology investments of $


million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers.

The Crescent Corridor consists of a program of projects for infrastructure and other facility improvements geared toward creating a seamless, high-capacity intermodal route spanning 11 states from New Jersey to Louisiana and offering truck-competitive serv

ice along several major interstate highway corridors, including I-81, I-85, I-20,

I-40, I-59, I-78, and

I-75.

Based on the public benefits that stand to be derived in the form of highway congestion relief,

we

plan to implement certain elements of the Cre

scent Corridor through a series of public-private partnerships.

Currently, the Crescent Corridor has received or expects to receive a total of $


million in public capital funding commitments from the Commonwealths of Pennsylv

ania and Virginia, the S

tate of Tennessee, the federal TIGER Stimulus Program and other federal funding sources related to projects in Alabama, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and North Carolina.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation

of financial statements in accordance with U.S.

G

enerally

A

ccepted

A

ccounting

P

rinciples

(GAAP)

requires

us

to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reportin

g period.

These estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require

us

to make changes to these estimates and assumptions.

Accordingly,

we

regularl

y review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors

we

believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.

We

regularly discuss the development, selection, and disclosures concernin

g critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of

the

Board of Directors.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans

requires

us

to make several estimates and assumptions (Note 11).

These include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets, projected increases in medical costs, and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected

earnings and mortality.

In addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value.

We

make these estimates based on

our

historical experience and ot

her information that

we

deem pertinent under the circumstances (for example,

expectations of future stock marke

t performance).

We

utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm’s studies to assist

us

in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing rela

ted liabilities.

K


Net pension expense, which is included in “Compensation and benefits” in

the

Consolidated Statements of Income, was $


million for


.

In recording this amount,

we

assumed a long-term i

nvestment rate of return of

8.25%

, which was supported by the long-term total rate of return on plan assets since inception.

A one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a $


million change in pension expense and, as a result, an equal change in “Compensation and benefits” expense.

Changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings, and mortality would not be e

xpected to have a material effect on

our

net pension expense or net pension liability in the future.

The net pension liability is recorded at net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the ti

ming of expected benefit payments.

We

utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds.

We

use the r

esults of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans.

Net cost for other postretirement benefits, which is also included in “Compensation and benefits,” was $


million for


.

In recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits,

we

estimated future increases in healthcare costs.

These assumptions,

along with the effect of a one-

percentage poi

nt change in them, are described in Note

11.

Properties and Depreciation

Most of

our

total assets are long-lived railway properties (Note 6).

As disclosed in Note 1, properties are deprecia

ted using group depreciation.

The primary depreciation method for

our

asset base is group life.

Units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources.

Remaining properties a

re depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives.

D

epreciation expense is based on assumptions concerning expected service lives of properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be rece

ived upon their retirement.

In developing these assumptions,

we

utilize periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an independent outside firm of consulting engineers and

approved by the

STB

.

D

epreciation studies are conducted about every three

years for equipment and every six years for track assets and other roadway property.

The frequency of these studies correlates with guidelines established by the STB.

Key factors which are considered in developing average service life and salvage

estimates include:

•

statistical analyses of historical retirement data and surviving asset records;

•

review of historical salvage received and current market rates;

•

review of

our

operations including expected changes in technology, customer demand, maintenance practices and asset management strategies;

•

review of accounting policies and assumptions; and

•

industry review and analysis.

The units of production depreciation rate for

rail in high density corridors is derived based on consideration of annual gross ton miles as compared to the total or ultimate capacity of rail in these corridors.

Our

experience has shown that traffic density is a leading factor in determination of the

expected service life of rail in high density corridors.

In developing the respective depreciation rate, consideration is also given to several rail characteristics including age, weight, condition (new or second hand) and type (curve or straight).

As a

result, a composite depreciation rate is developed which is applied to the depreciable base.

R

ecent experience with these studies has been that while t

hey do result in changes in depreciation rates

, these changes have not ca

used a significant effect to

a

nnual depreciation expense.

Changes in rates as a result of depreciation studies are implemented prospectively.

These studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by th

e study.

Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class

K


of property, a

s determined by the study.  D

epreciation expense for


totaled

$


million.

Our

composite depreciation rates for


are disclosed in Note 6; a one-tenth percentage point increase (or decrease) in these rates would have resulted in a $


million increase (or decrease) to depreciation expense.

For


, roadway depreciation rates ranged from

0.83%

to

33.3%

and equipment depreciation rates ranged from

1.32%

to

37.84%

.

When properties other than land and nonrail assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost of the assets, net of sale proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulat

ed depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized in earnings.

Actual historical cost values are retired when available, such as with equipment assets.

The use of estimates in recording the retirement of certain roadway assets is necessary based on the

impracticality of tracking individual asset costs.

When retiring rail, ties, and ballast,

we

use statistical curves that indicate the relative distribution of the age of the assets retired.

The historical cost of other roadway assets is estimated using a

combination of inflation indices specific to the rail industry and those published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The indices are applied to the replacement value based on the age of the retired assets.

These indices are used because they close

ly correlate with the costs of roadway assets. Gains and losses on disposal of land and nonrail assets are included in “Other income – net” (Note 2) since such income is not a product of

our

railroad operations.

A retirement is considered abnormal if it d

oes not occur in the normal course of business, if it relates to disposition of a large segment of an asset class and if the retirement varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies, which inherently consider

the impact of normal retirements on expected service lives and depreciation rates.

Gains or losses from abnormal retirements

would be recognized in earnings;

however, there were no such gains or losses in


,



, or


.

We

review

the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscount

ed cash flow.

Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review

would be

recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value

; however, there were no such impairments in


,


, or


.

Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities

C

asualties and other claims

expense

, included in “Materials and other,”

total

ed $


million

in


. Typically, most of this expense relates to

our

accrual for personal injury liabilities.

Job-related personal injury and occupa

tional claims are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to railroads.

FELA’s fault-based to

rt system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker’s compensation system.

The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded.

In all cas

es,

we

record a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable.

To aid in valuing

personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue

during each period, we utilize

studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm.

For employee personal injury cases, the actu

arial firm studies our

historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences

.  We

estimate the ultimate amount of the liability, which includes amounts for inc

urred but unasserted claims,

based on the results of this analysis.

For occupational injury claims

, the actuarial firm studies our

history of claim filings, severity, payments an

d other relevant facts.

Additionally,

our

estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting

our

experience into the future as far as can be reasonably deter

mined.

We have

recorded this actuarially determined liability. The liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves

,

as well as

our and

the

actuarial firm’s

judgments in the periodic studies. Accordingly, there could be significant changes in the liability, which

we

would recognize wh

en such a change became known.  W

hile the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study, it is possible that the ult

imate liability could be higher or lower.

The operating expenses for personal injury claims totaled $


million in 2012, $


million in 2011, and $


million in 2010.

We are

subject to various jurisdictions’ environmental

laws and regulations.

We

record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably (Note 16).

Claims, if any, against third

K


parties for recovery of cleanup cost

s

we’ve

incurred, are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not n

etted against the associated l

iability.

Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites an

d in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates.

We

ha

ve

an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret

our

environmental policy.

Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled $


million in


, $


million in


, and

$


million in


, and property additions for environmental matters tot

aled

$


million in


,

$


million in


, and $


million in


.

Property additions

for environmental matters in


are expected to be about $


million.

Our

Cons

olidated Balance Sheets include

liabilities for environmental exposures

of $


million at December 31,


, and $


million at December 31,


(of which $


million is classified as a current liability at the end of each period).

At December 31,


, the liability represents

our

estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at


known locations and projects.

As of that date,

nine

sites acc

ounted for $


million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material.

We

anticipate that much of this liability will be paid out over

five

years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period

.

At


locations, one or more

of our

subsidiaries in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liabilit

y Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes that impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs.

We

calculate

our

estimated liability for these sites based on facts and legal defenses applicable to each site and not solely on the basis of the potent

ial for joint liability.

With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by

us

or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of

our

ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are

necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques,

unpredictable contaminant recovery and reduction rates associated with available cleanup technologies, the likely development of new cleanup technologies,

the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant’s share of any estimated loss (and that participant’s ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liabil

ity.

We

estimate

our

environmental remediation liability on a site-by-site basis,

using assumptions and judgments we

dee

m

appropriate for each site.

As a result, it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these ma

ny

assumptions and judgments.

We

ha

ve

consistently applied

our

methodology of estimating

our

environmental liabilities.

Based on

the

assessment of facts and circumstances now known,

we

believe

we have

recorded the probable and reasonably estimable costs for

dealing with those environmental matters of which

we are

aware.

Further,

we

believe that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations,

or liquidity.

We

and/or certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations.

When

we

conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be

reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to e

arnings

.

While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on futu

re developments, in our

opinion,

the

recorded liability is adequate to cover the fut

ure payment of such liability and claims.

However, the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of

operations in a particular year or quarter.

Any adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments are known.

K


Income Taxes

Our

net

long-term deferred tax liability totaled $

7.8

billion at December 31,


(

Note 3).

This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial

statements.

After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns.

For state income and other taxes, judgment is also required

with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation all

owance is recorded if we

expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized.

We

had a $


million valuation al

lowance on $

1.0

b

illion of deferred tax assets as of December 3

1,


, r

eflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized.

In addition,

we

ha

ve

a recorded liability for

our

estimat

e of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.

Judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examinat

ion and, if so, judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing

authority.

We believe

this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate.

Income tax expense is adju

sted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded.

For every one half percent change in the


effective tax rate, net income would have chang

ed by $


million.

OTHER MATTERS

Labor Agreements

More than

80%

of

our

railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act (RLA).

We

largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads, re

presented by the National Carriers Conference Committee (NCCC). Moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes.

The

NCCC has concluded the round of bargaining that began in November 2009 and reached

national agreements with all applicable labor unions.  Although we previously concluded separate agreements with each of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) and the American Train Dispatchers Association (ATDA) that extend through D

ecember 31, 2014, the health and welfare provisions from the national agreements apply to the BLET and ATDA.  We bargain separately with our Ashtabula (Ohio) Docks longshoremen, who are represented by the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) and

do not participate in national bargaining.  We and the ILA have also reached agreement with moratorium provisions consistent with the moratorium provisions of the national agreements.

M

arket

Risks

We manage

overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating-rate debt instruments. At December 31,


, debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled $


million. A

one-percentage

point increase in interest rates would increase total annual interest expense related to all variable debt by approximately $


million.

We

consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations ap

plicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Inflation

In preparing financial statements,

GAAP

require

s

the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property.

As

a capital-intensive company,

we have

most of

our

capital invested in such property.

The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the

related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Norfolk Southern Corporation:

We have audited Norfolk Southern Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,


, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Norfolk Southern Corporation’s management is responsible for main

taining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Com

pany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to

obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a ma

terial weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

We believe

that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial sta

tements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable deta

il, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accept

ed accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of u

nauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Al

so, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Norfolk Southern Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,


, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – In

tegrated Framework,

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets o

f Norfolk Southern Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,


and


, and the related consolidated statements of income,

comprehensive income,

changes in stockh

olders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,


, and our report dated February 15,


expressed an unqualified opini

on on those consolidated financial statements.

Norfolk Southern Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to

Consolidated Financial Statements

The following Notes are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Norfolk Southern Corporation is a Virginia-based holding company engaged principally in the rail transportation business, operating approximately 20,000

miles of road

primarily in the East and Midwest.

These consolidated financial statements include

Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern) and its majority-owned and controlled subsidia

ries (collectively, NS

, we, us, and our).

Norfolk Southern’s

major subsidiary is Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR).

All significant intercompany balances a

nd transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

NSR and its railroad subsidiaries transport raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods classified in the following

commodity

groups (percent of total railway operating revenues in


):

coal (

26%

); intermodal (

20%

); chemicals (

14%

); agriculture/consumer products/government (

13%

); metals/construction (

12%

); automotive (

8%

); and, paper/clay/forest products (

7%

).

Although most of

our

customers are domestic, ultimate points of

origination or destination for some of the products transported (particularly coal bound for export and some intermodal containers) may be outside the U.S.

More than

80%

of

our

railroad employees are covered by collective bargainin

g agreements with various labor unions.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with

U

.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)

requires

us

to make

estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

We

periodically

review our

estimates, including those related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets, as well as liabilities for litigation, environmental remediation, casualty claims, income taxes and pension and other postretirement benefits.

Changes

in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Transportation revenue is recognized proportionally as a shipment moves from origin to destination

and related expenses are recognized as incurred.

Refunds (which are primarily volume-based incentives) are recorded as a reduction to revenues on the basis of management’s best estimate of projected liability, which is based on hist

orical activity, curren

t shipment

counts and the expectation of future activity.

We regularly monitor

our

contract refund liability and, historically, the estimates have not differed significantly from the amounts ultimately refunded.

Switching, demurrage and other incidental

service revenues are recognized when the services are performed.

Cash Equivalents

“Cash equivalents” are highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity.

K


Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Our

allowance for doubtful accounts was

$3

million at December 31,


and

$


million at December 31,


.

To determine

our

allowance for doubtful accounts,

we evaluate

historical loss experience (which has not been significant), the characteristics of current accounts, and general economic conditions and trends.

Materials and Supplies

“Materials and supplies,” consisting mainly of fuel oil and items for maintenance of property and

equipment, are stated at the lower of average cost or market.

The cost of materials and supplies expected to be used in property additions or improvements is included in “Properties.”

Investments

Debt securities classified as “held-to-maturity” are rep

orted at amortized cost.

Investments where

we have

the ability to exercise sig

nificant influence over but do

not control the entity are accounted for using the equity method, whereby the investment is carried at the cost of the acquisition plus

our

equ

ity in undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition.

Properties

“Properties” are stated principally at cost and are dep

reciated using the group method

whereby assets with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and depreciated using a composite depreciation rate.

This methodology treats each asset class as a pool of resources, not as singular items.

We use

more than 60 depreciable asset classes.

The p

rimary depreciation method for our

asset base is group life.

Units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources (Note 2).

Re

maining properties are depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives.

Depreciation in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows includes both depreciation and depletion.

D

epreciation expense is

based on

our

assumptions concerning expected service lives of

our

properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement.

In developing these assumptions,

we utilize

periodic depreciation studies that are performed by a

n independent outside firm of consulting engineers and approved by the Surface Transportation Board (S

TB)

.

Our

depreciation studies are conducted about every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets and other roadway property.

The f

requency of these studies is consistent with guidelines established by the STB.

Key factors which are considered in developing average service life and salvage estimates include:

•

statistical analysis of historical retirement data and surviving asset rec

ords;

•

review of historical salvage received and current market rates;

•

review of

our

operations including expected changes in technology, customer demand, maintenance practices and asset management strategies;

•

review of accounting policies and assumptions; and

•

industry review and analysis.

The units of production depreciation rate for rail in high density corridors is derived based on consideration of annual gross ton miles as compared to the total or ultimat

e capacity of rail in these corridors.

Our

experience has shown that traffic density is a leading factor in determination of the expected service life of rail in high density corridors.

In developing the respective depreciation rate, consideration is als

o given to several rail characteristics

K


including age, weight, condition (new or second hand) and type (curve or straight).

As a result, a composite depreciation rate is developed which is applied to the depreciable base.

Our

recent experience with these

studies has been that while they do result in changes in

the rates used to depreciate our

properties, these changes have not cau

sed a significant effect to

annual depreciation expense.

Changes in rates as a result of depreciation studies are implemented p

rospectively.

The studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study.

Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over th

e remaining service lives of the affected class of property, as determined by the study.

For


, roadway depreciation rates ranged from

0.83%

to

33.3%

and equipment depreciation

rates ranged from

1.32%

to

37.84%

.

We capitalize

interest on major

projects during the period of their construction.

Expenditures, including

those on leased assets,

that extend an asset

’

s useful life

or increase its utility, are capitalized.

Expenditures capitalized include those that are directly related to a capital project and may include materials, labor and equipment, in addition to an allocable portion of indirect costs that clearly relate to a

particular project. Due to the capital intensive nature of the railroad industry, a significant portion of annual capital spending relates to the replacement of self-constructed assets. Because removal activities occur in conjunction with replacement, rem

oval costs are estimated based on an average percentage of time employees replacing assets spend on removal functions.

Costs related to repairs and maintenance activities that do not extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are expensed when

such repairs are performed.

When properties other than land and nonrail assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost of the assets, net of sale proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is

recognized in earnings.

Actual historical cost values are retired when available, such as with equipment assets.

The use of estimates in recording the retirement of certain roadway assets is necessary based on the impracticality of tracking individual as

set costs.

When r

etiring rail, ties and ballast, we use

statistical curves that indicate the relative distribution of the age of the assets retired.

The historical cost of other roadway assets is estimated using a combination of inflation indices specifi

c to the rail industry and those published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The indices are applied to the replacement value based on the age of the retired assets.

These indices are used because they closely correlate with the costs of roadway as

sets.

Gains and losses on disposal of land and nonrail assets are included in “Other income – net”

(Note 2) since such income is not a product of

our

railroad operations.

A retirement is considered abnormal if it does not occur in the normal course of bu

siness, if it relates to disposition of a large segment of an asset class and if the retirement varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies, which inherently consider the impact of normal retirements on expe

cted servi

ce lives and depreciation rates.

Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recognized in earnings.

We

review the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in

circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows.

Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value.

Required Accounting Ch

anges

In the first quarter of 2012, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-05,

“

Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income.”

This update requires that the total of comprehensive income, the components of net in

come, and the components of other comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.  This update does not change what items are reported in other comprehensive i

ncome or the requirement to report reclassification of items from other comprehensive income to net income.

In the first quarter of 2012, we adopted ASU No. 2011-04,

“

Fair Value Measurements (T

opic 820):  Amendments to achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs.”

This

update provides clarification about the application of existing fair value measurements and disclosure requirements, and expands cert

ain other disclosure requirements.

Except for amounts for which a valuation allowance has been provided,

we believe

that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.

The valuation allowance at the end of each year primarily relates to subsidiary state income tax net operati

ng losses that may not be utilized prior to their expiration.

The total valuation allowance

remained unchanged

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,


, are potential benefits of $


million that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.

Unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final ou

tcome differs from the amount recorded.

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examinations have been completed for all years prior to 2011.  We expect the IRS to begin auditing our 2011 and 2012 consolidated income tax returns in late 2013.

State income tax returns generally are subject to examination for a period of three to four years after filing of the return.

In addition,

we are

generally obligated to report changes in taxable income arising from federal income tax examinations to the

states within a period of up to two years from the date the federal examination is final.

We have

various state income tax returns either under examination, administrative appeals, or litigation.

We expect

that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefi

ts at December 31, 201


, will decrease by approximately

Fair Value

Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820-10,

“Fair Value Measurements,”

established a framework for measuring fair value and a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels, as follows:

The asset’s or liability’s fair value measurement level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Other than those assets and liabilities described below that approximate

fair value, there were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2012 or

2011.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

We have

evaluated the fair values of financial instruments and methods used to determine those fair values.

The fair values of “Cash and cash equivalents,” “Short-term investments,” “Accounts receivable,” “Accounts payable,” and “Short-term debt” approximate car

rying values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments.

The carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance is recorded at cash surrender value and, accordingly, approximates fair value. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values f

or the

remaining financial instruments, excluding investments

accounted for under the equity method, consisted of the following at December 31:

Investment in Conrail

Through a limited liability company,

we

and CSX Corporation (CSX) jointly own Conrail Inc. (Conrail), whose primary subsidiary is Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC).

We have

a

58%

economic and

50%

voting interest in the jointly owned ent

ity, and CSX has the remainder of the economic and voting interests.

We are

amortizing the excess of the purchase price over Conrail’s net equity using the principles of purchase accounting, based primarily on the estimated useful lives of Conrail’s depre

ciable property and equipment, including the related deferred tax effect of the differences in

book and

tax accounting bases for such assets, as all of the purchase price at acquisition was allocable to Conrail’s tangible assets and liabilities.

At Decemb

er 31,


, based on the funded stat

us of Conrail’s pension plans, we

decreased

our

proportional investment in Conrail by $


million.

This resulted in

a loss

of $


million recorded to “Other comprehensive loss” and a combined federal and state deferred tax

asset

of $


million.

Our

equity in the earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, included in “Other

income – net” was $

CRC owns and operates certain properties (the Shared Assets Areas) for the join

t and exclusive benefit of NSR and CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT).

The costs of operating the Shared Assets Areas are borne by NSR and CSXT based on usage.

In addition, NSR and CSXT pay CRC a fee for access to the Shared Assets Areas.

“Purchased service

elect the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans.

Asset Management

.

Investments are restricted to domestic and international equity

securitie

s,

domestic and international fixed in

come securities,

and unleveraged exchange-traded options and financial futures.

Limitations restrict investment concentration and use of certain derivative investments.

The target asset allocation for equity is

75%

of the pension

plan

s’

assets.

The fixed income portfolio is invested in the Barclays Government/Credit Bond Index Fund, except that the Canadian earmarked portion of the

portfolio is maintained in U.S. Treasury

Bonds.

Equity investments must be in liquid securities list

ed on national exchanges.

N

o investment is permitted in

our

securities (except through commingled pension trust funds).

Investment managers’ returns are expected to meet or exceed selected market indices by prescribed margins.

Our

The other postretirement benefit plan assets consist primarily of trust-owned variable life insurance policies with an asset allocation at December 31,


, of

58%

in equity securities and

42%

in debt securities compared with

56%

in equity securities and

44%

in debt securities at December 31,


.

The target asset allocation for equity is between

50%

and

75%

of the

plan’s assets.

The plans’ assumed future returns are based principally on the asset allocations and historic returns for the plans’ asset classes determined from both actual plan returns and, over longer time periods, market returns for those asset class

es. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair v

alue over a three-year period. We

assumed a rate of return on pension plan assets of

8.25%

for


and

8.75%

for both

A

valued at the official closing price as defined by the exchange or at the most recent trade price of a security at the close of the active market.

Common collective trusts:

Valued at the net asset value (NAV) of shares held by the plan at year end, base

d on the quoted market prices of the underlying assets of the trusts.

The investments are valued using NAV as a practical expedient for fair value.

The common collective trusts hold equity securities, fixed income securities and cash and cash equivalents

.

Corporate bonds and other fixed income instruments:

When available, valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a similar security at year end using observable market inputs.

Otherwise, valued at an estimated price at which a dealer w

ould pay for a similar security at year end using unobservable market inputs.

Municipal bonds:

Valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security at year end using observable market based inputs.

Commingled funds:

Valued at the NAV

of shares held by the plan at year end, based on the quoted market prices of the underlying assets of the funds.

The investments are valued using NAV as a practical expedient for fair value.

The commingled funds hold equity securities.

Interest bearing

cash:

Short-term bills or notes are valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for the security at year end using observable market based inputs; money market funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the

funds are traded.

United States Government and agencies securities:

Valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security at year end using observable as well as unobservable market based inputs.

Inflation adjusted instruments utilize

the appropriate index factor.

Preferred stock:

Shares held by the plan at year end are valued at the most recent trade price of a security at the close of the active market or at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a similar security at y

ear end using

primarily

observable as well as unobservable market-based inputs.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for other

postretirement benefit plan assets measured at fair value.

Trust-owned life insurance:

V

alued at

our

share of the net assets of trust-owned life insurance issued by a major insurance company.

The underlying investments of that trust

consist of a U.S. st

ock account

and a U.S. bond account, valued based upon the aggregate market values of the underlying investments.

The loan asset account is valued at cash surrender value at the time of the loan, plus accrued interest.

The other postretirement benefit pl

an assets consisted of trust-owned life insurance with fair values of

$


million and $


million at December 31,


and


,

respectively, and are valued under

level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. There were no level 1 or level 3 related assets.

The methods used to value pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or

reflective of future fair values.

Furthermore, while

we

believe

our

valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instru

ments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

Stock-Based Compensation

Under the stockholder-approved Long-Te

rm Incentive Plan (LTIP),

the Compensation C

ommittee

(Committee), made up

of nonemployee

members

of the Board

of Directors

or the

C

hief

E

xecutive

O

fficer (if delegated such authority by the

C

ommittee)

,

may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights (SA

Rs), restricted stock units (RSUs), restricted shares, performance share units (PSUs), and performance shares, up to a maximum of

96,125,000

shares of

our common Stock (

Common Stock

)

.

Of these shares,

5,

000,000

were approved by the Board for issuance to non-officer participants; as a broad-based issuance, stockholder approval was not required.

In May 2010, the stockholders approved an amended LTIP that eliminated the previous limit on the number of shares of

Common Stock

that could be granted as RSUs, restricted shares, or

PSUs

and instead adopted a fungible share reserve ratio so that, for awar

ds granted after May 13, 2010, the number of shares remaining for issuance under the amended LTIP will be reduced (i) by 1 for each award granted as a stock option or stock-settled SAR, or (ii) by 1.61 for an award made in the form other than a stock optio

n or stock-settled SAR.

Under the Board-approved Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan (TSOP), the

C

ommittee may grant stock options up to a maximum of

K


6,000,000 shares of Common Stock; as a broad-based stock option plan, stockholder approval of TSOP was not req

uired.

We use

newly issued shares to satisfy any exercises and awards under LTIP and TSOP.

LTIP also permits the payment – on a current or a deferred basis and in cash or in stock – of dividend equivalents on shares of Common Stock covered by stock optio

ns, RSUs, or PSUs in an amount commensurate with regular quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock.

With respect to stock options, if employment of the participant is terminated for any reason, including retirement, disability, or death,

we

have no further

obligation to make any dividend equivalent payments.

Regarding RSUs, if employment of the participant is terminated for any reason other than retirement, disability, or death,

we

have no further obligation to make any dividend equivalent payments.

Shoul

d an employee terminate employment, they are not required to forfeit dividend equivalent payments already received.

Outstanding PSUs do not currently receive dividend equivalent payments.

During the first quarter of


,

the Commi

ttee

granted stock options, RSUs and PSUs pursuant to LTIP and granted stock options pursuant to TSOP.

Receipt of an award under LTIP was made contingent upon the awardee’s execution of a non-compete agreement, and all awards under LTIP were made subject

to forfeiture in the event the awardee “engages in competing employment” for a period of time following retirement.

Accounting Method

We account for our

grants of stock options

,

RSUs, PSUs,

and

dividend equivalent

payment

s in accordance with ASC 718

“Com

pensation-Stock Compensation.”

Accordingly, all awards result in charges to net income while dividend equivalent

payments

, which are all related to equity classified awards, are charged to retained income. Related compensation costs were $


million in


, $


million in


, and $


million in


.

The total tax effects recognized in income in relation to stock-based compens

ation were benefits of $


million in


, $

, and $

All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten years.

In the first quarter of

may not be exercised prior to the fourth and third anniversaries of

the date of grant, respectively, or if the optionee retires or dies before that anniversary date, may not be exercised before

the later of one year after the grant date or the date of the optionee’s retirement or death.

In the first quarter of

Holders

of the options granted under

LTIP in


who remain actively employed receive cash dividend equivalent payments for four years in

an amount equal to the regular quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock.

Dividend equivalent payments are not made on TSOP options.

K


The fair value of each option awarded in


,


, and


was measured on the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model.

Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities fro

m traded options on

and historical volatility of Common Stock.

H

istorical data

is used

to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model.

The average expected option life is derived from the output of the valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.

T

he average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

For options granted that include dividend equivalent payments, a dividend yield of zero was used.

For


,


, and


, a dividend yield of

2.30%

,

2.55%

, and

2.89%

Commitments and Contingencies

Lawsuits

We

and/or certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations.

When

we conclude

that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and

the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to earnings.

While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments, in

our

opinion, the recorded liab

ility is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims.

However, the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that

could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.

Any adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments are known.

One

of

our

customers

, DuPont, has a rate reasonableness

complaint

pending before the STB

alleging that

our

tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable.

We

dispute th

is

allegation

.  S

ince June 1, 2009,

we

ha

ve

been billing and collecting

from DuPon

t

amounts based on the challenged tariff rates.

We presently expect

resolution of the DuPont case to occur in 2

014 and believe

the estimate of reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or li

quidity.

With regard to rate cases,

we

record adjustments to revenues in the periods, if and when, such adjustments are probable and estimable.

On November 6, 2007, various antitrust class actions filed against

us

and other C

lass I

railroads in various F

ederal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in the District of Columbia by the Judicial Panel on

K


Multidistrict Litigation.

We believe

the allegations in the complaints are with

out merit and intend

to vigorously defend the cases.

We

do

not believe that the outcome of these proceedings

will have a material effect on our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

A lawsuit filed on March 25, 2008, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota containing simila

r allegations against

us

and four

other major railroads

was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff subject to a tolling agreement entered into in August 2008.

Casualty Claims

Casualty claims include employee personal injury and occupational claims as wel

l as third-party claims, all exclusive of legal costs.

To aid in valuing

our

personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year,

we utilize

studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial fir

m.

Job-related accidental injury and occupational claims are subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads.

FELA’s fault-based system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared wit

h a no-fault workers’ compensation system.

The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded.

While the ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on future developments, in

our

opinion,

the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payments of claims and is supported by the most recent actuarial study.

In all cases,

we record

a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable.

The Consolidated Bala

nce Sheets reflect long-term receivables

for estimated recoveries from our

insurance carriers for claims associated with the January 6, 2005, derailment in Graniteville, S.C.

In the first quarter of 2011,

we

received an unfavorable ruling for an arbitrati

on claim with an insurance carrier, and

were

denied recovery of the contested portion of the claim.

As a result,

we

recorded a $43 million charge for the receivables associated with the contested portion of the claim and a $15 million charge for other rec

eivables affected by the ruling for which recovery is no longer probable.

Employee personal injury claims

– The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is employee personal injury costs.

The independent actuarial firm engaged by

us

pro

vides quarterly studies to aid in valuing

our

employee personal injury liability and estimating personal injury expens

e.

The actuarial firm studies our

historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant ou

tside influences.

The actuar

ial firm

uses the results of these analyses to estimate the ultimate amount of liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims.

We adjust the

liability quarterly based upon

our

assessment and the results of

the study.

Our

estimate of loss liabilities is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events such as jury decisions, court interpretations, or legislative changes and as such the actual loss may vary from the estimated

liability recorded.

Occupational claims

– Occupational claims (including asbestosis and other respiratory diseases, as well as conditions allegedly related to repetitive motion) are often not caused by a specific accident or event but rather allegedly

result from a claimed exposure over time.

Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been employed in the rail industry for decades.

The independent actuarial firm provides an estimate of the occupational cl

aims liability based upon

our

history of claim filings, severity, payments, and other pertinent facts.

The liability is dependent upon judgments

we make

as to the specific case reserves as well as judgments of the actuarial firm in the

quarterly

studies.

The actuarial firm’s estimate of ultimate loss includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported.

This provision is derived by analyzing industry data and projecting

our

experience into the future as far as can be reasonably

determined.

We adjust

the

liability quarterly based upon

our

assessment and the results of the study.

However, it is possible that the recorded liability may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims.

Adjustments to the recorded liability ar

e reflected in operating expenses in the periods in which such adjustments become known.

Third-party claims

–

We record

a liability for third-party claims including those for highway crossing a

ccidents, trespasser and other injuries, automobile liability, property damage, and lading damage.

The actuarial firm assists

us

with the calculation of potential liability for third-party claims, ex

cept lading damage, based upon our

experience including

the

number and timing of incidents, amount of payments, settlement rates, number of open claims, and legal defenses. The actuarial estimate includes a provision for claims that have been incurred but not

K


reported.

We adjust the

liability

quarterly

based up

on

our

assessment and the results of the study.

Given the inherent uncertainty in regard to the ultimate outcome of third-party claims, it is possible that the actual loss may differ from the estimated liability recorded.

Environmental Matters

We are

su

bject to various jurisdictions’ environmental laws and regulations.

We

record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably.

Claims, if any, against third parties, for recovery of cleanup costs

we have

in

curred are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the associated liability.

Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determ

ining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates.

We

have

an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret

our

environmental policy.

Our

Consolidated Balance Sheets include liabilities for environmental exposures of $


million at December 31,


, and $


million at December 31,


(of which $


million is classified as a current liability at

both

December 31,


and


).

At December 31,


, the liability represents our

estimate of the probable cleanup and remedia

tion costs based on available information at


known locations and projects compared with


locations and projects at December 31,


.

At

December 31,


,

nine

sites accounte

d for $


million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material.

We anticipate

that much of this liability will be paid out over

five

years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period.

At


locations, one or more

of our

subsidiaries in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 or comparable state statutes that impose joint

and several liability for cleanup costs.

We calculate

our

estimated liability for these sites based on facts and legal defenses applicable to each site and not solely on the basis of the potential for joint liability.

With respect to known environmenta

l

sites (whether identified by us

or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of

our

ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of

currently available cleanup techniques, unpredictable contaminant recovery and reduction rates associated with available cleanup technologies, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full

extent of contamination and each potential participant’s share of any estimated loss (and that participant’s ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.

The risk of incurring environmental liability – for acts

and omissions, past, present, and future – is inherent in the railroad business.

Some of the commodities in

our

traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, pose special risks that

we

work diligently to minimize.

In addition, sever

al

of our s

ubsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased and operated by others, or held for sale.

Because environmental problems

that are latent or undisclosed

may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance

that

we

will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time.

Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and potentially other unidentified

environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time.

The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

Based on

our

assessment of the facts and circumstances now known,

we believe

we have

recorded the probable and reasonably estimable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which

we are

aware.

F

urther,

we believe

that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

K


Insurance

We obtain

on behalf of

ourself

and

our

subsidiaries insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages.

We

are

currently self-insured up to $


million and above $


billion per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage to third parties and up to $


million and above $


million per occurrence for property owned by

us

or i

n

our

car

e, custody, or control.

Purchase Commitments

At December 31,


,

we

had outstanding purchase commitments totaling approximately $


million for long-term service contracts through 2019 as well as

locomotives,

track material, and freight cars, in connection with

our

capital programs through 2016.

Change-In-Control Arrangements

We have

compensation agreements with certain officers and key employees that become operative only upon a change in control of

Norfolk Southern

, as defined in those agreements.

The agreements provide generally for payments based on

compensation at the time of a covered individual’s involuntary or other specified termination and for certain other benefits.

Guarantees

In a number of instances,

we

have agreed to indemnify lenders for additional costs they may bear as a result of cer

tain changes in laws or regulations applicable to their loans.

Such changes may include impositions or modifications with respect to taxes, duties, reserves, liquidity, capital adequacy, special deposits, and similar requirements relating to extensions of

credit by, deposits with, or the assets or liabilities of such lenders.

The nature and timing of changes in laws or regulations applicable to

our

financings are inherently unpredictable, and therefore

our

exposure in connection with the foregoing indemni

fications cannot be quantified.

No liability has been recorded related to these indemnifications.

We have

agreed to indemnify parties in a number of transactions for U.S. income tax withholding imposed as a result of changes in U.S. tax law.

In all ca

ses,

we

ha

ve

the right to unwind the related transaction if the withholding cannot be avoided in the future.

Because these indemnities would be triggered and are dependent upon a change in the tax law, the maximum exposure is not quantifiable.

We do not

believe it is likely that we

will be required to make any payments under these indemnities.

At

December 31,


, certain Norfolk Southern subsidiaries are contingently

liable as guarantors with respect to

$


million of indebtedness, due in 2019, of an entity in which they have an ownership interest, the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis.

Four other railroads are also jointly and sever

ally liable as guarantors for this indebtedness.

No liability has been recorded related to this guaranty.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our

Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of management, eva

luated the effectiveness of our

disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act))

at

December 31,


.

Based on such e

valuation,

our

officers have concluded that,

at

December 31,


,

our

disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in

our

reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed

, summarized, and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to al

low timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are

responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.

Our

internal control over financial reporting includes t

hose policies and procedures that pertain

to our

ability to record, process, summarize, and report reliable financial data.

We recognize

that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including t

he possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control.

Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.

Further, b

ecause of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.

In order to ensure that

our

internal control over financial reporting is effective,

we

regularly assess such controls and did so most recently for

our

financial reporting

at

December 31,


.

This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the Committee of S

ponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

.

Based on our assessment,

we have

concluded that

we

maintained effective internal control over financial reporting

at

December 31,


.

Our

Board of Directors, acting through

its

Audit Committee, is responsible for the oversight of

our

accounting policies, financial reporting, and internal control.

The Audit Committee of

our

Board of Directors is comprised entirely of outside directo

rs who are independent of management.

The independent registere

d public accounting firm and our

internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the Audit Committee, with or without management, to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial

reporting, and any other matters which

they

believe should be brought to the attention of the Audit Committee.

We have

issued a report of

our

assessment of internal control over financial reporting, and

our

independent registered public accounting firm h

as issued an attestation report on

our

internal control

over financial reporting

at

December 31,


.

These reports appear in Part II, Item 8 of this report on Form 10-K.

During the fourth quarter of


,

we have

not identified any changes in internal control

over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially effect,

our

internal control over financial reporting.

Norfolk

Southern Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

Established on June 28, 1983, and approved by

our

stockholders at their Annual Meeting held on May 10, 1984, LTIP was adopted to promote the success of

our company

by providing an opportunity for non-em

ployee

D

irectors, officers, and other key employees to acquire a proprietary interest in the Corpor

ation.

On January 23, 2001, our

Board of Directors further amended LTIP and approved the issuance of an additional 5,000,000 shares of authorized but unissu

ed Common Stock to participants who are not officers of

our company

.

The issuance of these shares was broadly-based, and stockholder approval of these shares was

not required.

Accordingly, this portion of LTIP is included in the number of securities avai

lable for future issuance for plans not approved by stockholders.

Also on

January 23, 2001,

our

Board

of Directors

amended LTIP, which amendment was approved by shareholders on May 10, 2001, that included the reservation for issuance of an additional 30,0

00,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock.

In May 2010,

our

shareholders approved an amended LTIP that adopted a fungible share reserve ratio so that, for awards granted after May 13, 2010, the number of shares remaining for issuance under the

amended LTIP will be reduced (i) by 1 for each award granted as an option or stock-settled stock appreciation right, or (ii) by 1.61 for an award made in the form other than an option or stock-settled stock appreciation right.

Cash payments of restricted

units, stock appreciation rights, and

PSUs

will not be applied against the maximum number of shares issuable under LTIP.

Any shares of Common Stock subject to options,

PSUs

, restricted shares, or

RSUs

which are not issued as Common Stock will again be av

ailable for award under LTIP after the expiration or forfeiture of an award.

Non-employee D

irectors, officers, and other key employees residing in the United States or Canada are eligible for selection to receive LTIP awards.

Under LTIP, the Compensation

Committee (Committee) may grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,

RSUs

, restricted shares,

PSUs, and performance shares.

I

n addition, dividend equivalent payments

may be awarded for options,

RSUs

, and

PSUs

.

The Committee may make awards under LTIP subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances and may establish such other terms and conditions for the awards as provided in LTIP.

For options granted after May 13, 2010, the option price will be at least the

higher of (i) the average of the high and low prices at which Common Stock is traded on the date of grant, or (ii) the closing price of Common Stock on the date of the grant.

All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and the term o

f the option will not exceed ten years.

LTIP specifically prohibits option repricing without stockholder approval, except for capital adjustments.

PSUs

entitle a recipient to receive performance-based compensation at the end of a three-year cycle based on

our

pe

rformance during that

period.

For the 201


PSU

awards, corporate performance will be measured using three equally weighted standards established

by the Committee:

(1) three-year average return on average capital invested, (2) three-year average operating ratio, and (3

) total return to stockholders measured at the end of the three-year period

.

PSUs

may be payable in either shares of Common Stock

or cash.

RSUs

are payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock at the end of a restriction period of not less than 36 months and not more than 60 months.

During the restriction period, the holder of the

RSUs

has no beneficial ownership interest in the C

ommon Stock represented by the

RSUs

and has no right to vote the shares represented by the units or to receive dividends (except for dividend equivalent

payment

rights that may be awarded with respect to the

RSUs

).

The Committee at its discretion may waiv

e the restriction period, but settlement of any

RSUs

will occur on the same settlement date as would have applied absent a waiver of restrictions, if no performance goals were imposed.

K


Norfolk Southern Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan (TSOP)

Our Board of Directors adopted

TSOP on January 26, 1999, to promote the success of

our company

by providing an opportunity for nonagreement employees to acquire a proprietary interest in

our company

and thereby to provide an additional incentive to nonag

reement employees to devote their maximum efforts and skills to the advancement, betterment, and prosperity of

our company

and

our stockholders.

Under

TSOP there were 6,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock reserved for issuance.

TSOP ha

s not been and is not required to have been approved by

our

stockholders.

Active full-time nonagreement employees residing in the United States or Canada are eligible for selection to receive TSOP awards.

Under TSOP, the Committee may grant nonqualified

stock options subject to such terms and conditions as provided in TSOP.

The option price

may not be less than

the average of the high and low prices at which Common Stock is traded on the date of the grant.

All options are subject to a vesting period o

f at least one year, and the term of the opt

ion will not exceed ten years.

TSOP specifically prohibits repricing without stockholder approval, except for capital adjustments.

Norfolk Southern Corporation Directors’ Restricted Stock Plan (Plan)

The Plan

was adopted on January 1, 1994, and is designed to increase ownership of Common Stock by

our

non-employee

D

irectors so as to further align their ownership interest in

our company

with that of

our stockholders.

The Plan has not been and is not required to

have been approved by

our

stockholders.

Currently, a maximum of

66,000

shares of Common Stock may be granted under the Plan.

To make grants eligible to

D

irectors,

we

purchase, through one or more subsidiary companies, the numbe

r of shares required in open-market transactions at pr

evailing market prices, or make

such grants from Common Stock already owned by one or more of

our

subsidiary companies.

Only non-employee

D

irectors who are not and never have been employees of

our comp

any

are eligible to participate in the Plan.

Upon becoming a

D

irector, each eligible

D

irector receives a one-time grant of 3,000 restricted shares of Common Stock.

No individual member of the Board exercises discretion concerning the eligibility of any

D

irector or the number of shares granted.

The restriction period applicable to restricted shares granted under the Plan begins on the date of the grant and ends on the earlier of the recipient’s

death or six months afte

r the recipient ceases to be a D

irector by reason of disability or retirement.

During the restriction period, shares may not be sold, pledged, or otherwise encumbered.

Directors will forfeit the restricted shar

es if they cease to

serve as a D

irector of

our company

for reasons other than their disability, retirement, or death.
