RAILWAY
OPERATING REVENUES --

NS' total railway operating revenues were $9.4 billion
in 2007.
 
See the financial
information by traffic segment in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.”

COAL
TRAFFIC

- --

Coal,
coke and iron ore -- most of which is bituminous coal -- is NS'
railroads' largest commodity group as measured by revenues.
 
The railroads handled a total of 186.0 million
tons in 2007, most of which originated on NS' lines in
West
 Virginia
,
Virginia
,
Pennsylvania
 and
Kentucky
..
 
Revenues from coal, coke and iron ore
accounted for about 25% of NS' total railway operating revenues in 2007.

Total
coal handled through all system ports in 2007 was 34.1 million tons.
 
Of this total, 13.4 million tons
(including coastwise traffic) moved through
Norfolk
,

Virginia
, 2.9 million tons moved through the
Baltimore Terminal, 10.9 million tons moved to various docks on the Ohio
River, and 6.9 million tons moved to various
Lake Erie

ports.
 
Other than coal for export,
virtually all coal handled by NS' railroads was terminated in states east of
the
Mississippi River
..

See
the discussion of coal traffic, by type of coal, in Part II, Item 7,
“Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.”

GENERAL
MERCHANDISE
TRAFFIC
 -

General merchandise
traffic is composed of five major commodity groupings:  automotive;
chemicals; metals and construction; agriculture, consumer products and
government; and paper, clay and forest products.
 
The automotive group includes finished
vehicles for BMW, Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Isuzu,
Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saab, Subaru,
Suzu
ki
,
Toyota

and Volkswagen, and auto parts for Ford Motor Company, General Motors,
Mercedes-Benz and
Toyota
..
 
The chemicals group includes sulfur and
related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds,
plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes and municipal
wastes.
 
The metals and construction
group includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement,
aggregates, bricks and minerals.
 

The agriculture, consumer products and government group includes
soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour,
beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products, ethanol and items for
the military.
 
The paper, clay and
forest products group includes lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper
products, wood fibers, wood pulp, scrap paper and clay.

In 2007, 142 million tons of general
merchandise freight, or approximately 67% of total general merchandise tonnage
handled by NS, originated online.
 
The balance of general merchandise
traffic was received from connecting carriers at interterritorial
gateways.
 
The principal interchange
points for NS-received traffic included
Chicago
,

Memphis
,
New Orleans
,

Cincinnati
,
Kansas

City,
Detroit
,
Hagerstown
,
St. Louis/East St. Louis and
Louisville
..
 
General merchandise carloads handled in
2007 were 2.8 million, the revenue from which accounted for 55% of
NS’ total railway operating revenues in 2007.

See
the discussion of general merchandise rail traffic by commodity group in
Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

INTERMODAL

TRAFFIC
 -

The intermodal market
consists of shipments moving in trailers, domestic and international
containers, and Roadrailer® equipment.
 

These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies,
international steamship lines, truckers and other shippers.
 
Intermodal units handled in 2007 were 3.1 million,
the revenues from which accounted for 20% of NS’ total railway operating
revenues for the year.

See
the discussion of intermodal traffic in Part II, Item 7, “Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.”

FREIGHT
RATES -

In
2007, NS' railroads continued their reliance on private contracts and exempt
price quotes as their predominant pricing mechanisms.
 
Thus, a major portion of NS' railroads'
freight business is not currently economically regulated by the government.
 
In general, market forces have been
substituted for government regulation and now are the primary determinant of
rail service prices.

In 2006, NS' railroads were found by the STB to be
“revenue adequate” based on results for the year 2005.
 
The STB has not made its revenue
adequacy determination for the year 2006.
 

A railroad is “revenue adequate” under the applicable law
when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry's composite cost of
capital.
 
This determination is made
pursuant to a statutory requirement.

As a result, the remaining serviceability
of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the high
percentage of freight cars built in earlier years.

Ongoing freight car and locomotive maintenance
programs are intended to ensure the highest standards of safety, reliability,
customer satisfaction and equipment marketability.
 
The locomotive bad order ratio includes units
out of service for required inspections every 92 days and program work such as
overhauls.

Microwave
System -

The NS microwave system, consisting of approximately 7,400 radio
route miles, 424 core stations, 14 secondary stations and 5 passive
repeater stations, provides communications between most operating
locations.
 
The microwave system is
used primarily for voice communications, VHF radio control circuits, data and
facsimile transmissions, traffic control operations and AEI data transmissions.

Traffic
Control -

Of the approximately 15,900 route miles owned by NS, about 11,000 miles are
signalized, including 8,000 miles of centralized traffic control (CTC) and 3,000 miles
of automatic block signals.
 

Of the 8,000 miles of CTC, approximately 3,000 miles are controlled
by data radio originating at 258 base station radio sites.

Computers -

A computer network
consisting of a centralized data center in
Atlanta
,
Georgia
,
and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards,
terminals, transportation offices, rolling stock repair points, sales offices
and other key system locations.
 

Operating and traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers
with information on their shipments throughout the system.
 
Computer systems provide current
information on the location of every train and each car on line, as well as
related waybill and other train and car movement data.
 
In addition, the computer systems are
utilized to assist management in the performance of a variety of functions and
services including payroll, car and revenue accounting, billing, material
management activities and controls, and special studies.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS -

Compliance with federal,
state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment is a principal NS goal.
 

To date, such compliance has not affected materially NS' capital
additions, earnings, liquidity or competitive position.
 
See “Legal Proceedings,”
Part I, Item 3; “Personal Injury, Environmental and Legal Liabilities”
in Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations;” and Note 17 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

See the
discussion of “Labor Agreements” in Part II, Item 7,
“Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.”

GOVERNMENT
REGULATION -

In addition to environmental, safety, securities and other
regulations generally applicable to all businesses, NS' railroads are subject
to regulation by the STB.
 
The STB
has

jurisdiction
over some rates, routes, conditions of service and the extension or abandonment
of rail lines.
 
The STB also has
jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger or acquisition of control of and by
rail common carriers.
 
The Federal
Railroad Administration regulates certain track and mechanical equipment
standards.

The
relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, begun over two decades ago
under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, includes exemptions of intermodal business
(trailer-on-flat-car, container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar traffic, lumber,
manufactured steel, automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel,
pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing.
 
Transportation contracts on regulated shipments
effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well for the duration of
the contract.
 
About 87% of NS'
freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under
transportation contracts.

Efforts were made in 2007 to re-subject the rail
industry to unwarranted federal economic regulation and such efforts are
expected to continue in 2008.
 
The Staggers
Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and
enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business, thereby
contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the
revitalization of the industry.
 

Accordingly, NS will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose unwarranted
economic regulation.

COMPETITION -

There is continuing
strong competition among rail, water and highway carriers.
 
Price is usually only one factor of
importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific
hauling company.
 
Inventory carrying
costs, service reliability, ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and
damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for
higher-valued finished goods, machinery and consumer products.
 
Even for raw materials, semifinished
goods and work-in-process, users are increasingly sensitive to transport
arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.

NS'
primary rail competitor is the CSX system; both operate throughout much of the
same territory.
 
Other railroads
also operate in parts of the territory.
 

NS also competes with motor carriers, water carriers and with shippers
who have the additional option of handling their own goods in private carriage.

Certain
marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers
enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets.

SECURITY OF OPERATIONS -

NS has taken significant steps to provide enhanced
security for the NS rail system.
 
In
particular, NS has developed and implemented a comprehensive security plan that
is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared
by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11, 2001.
 
The AAR Security Plan defines four Alert
Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied
across the railroad industry, as the terrorist threat increases or
decreases.  The Alert Level actions include countermeasures that will be
applied in three general areas: (1) operations (including transportation,
engineering, and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications;
and (3) railroad police.
 
Although

security concerns preclude public disclosure of its contents,
the NS Departmental Security Plan outlines the protocol within NS for all
concerned to be notified of AAR Alert Level changes

.
 
All NS Operations Division employees are
advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers, as appropriate, of any
change in Alert Level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to
such change.

The NS plan also effectively
addresses and complies with Department of Transportation security regulations
pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of
hazardous materials.
 
Among more
focused elements of the plan, security awareness training is given to all
railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation
safety, and this training is integrated into recurring hazardous material
training and re-certification programs.  Toward that end, NS, wor
ki
ng closely with the National Transit Institute at
Rutgers
University
, developed a four-module
uniform national training program.
 

More in-depth security training has been given to those select NS
employees who have been given specific security responsibilities, and
additional,

location-specific security
plans have been developed for certain metropolitan areas and each of six port
facilities served by NS.
 
With
respect to the ports, each facility plan has been approved by the applicable
Captain of the Port and subject to inspection by the U.S. Coast
Guard.

Additionally,
NS engages in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state
agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the
Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the U.S. Coast
Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and various state Homeland Security
offices.
 
As one notable example, an
NS Police Special Agent, under the auspices of the AAR, has been assigned to
the National Joint Terrorism Task Force (NJTTF) operating out of FBI
Headquarters in
Washington
,

D.C.
 to represent and serve as
liaison to the North American rail industry.
 
This arrangement improves logistical
flow of vital security and law enforcement information with respect to the rail
industry as a whole, while having the post filled by an NS Special Agent has
served to foster a strong wor
ki
ng
relationship between NS and the FBI.
 

NS also has become a member of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against
Terrorism (C-TPAT) program sponsored by U.S. Customs.  C-TPAT allows NS to
work closely with U.S. Customs and its customers to develop measures that will
help ensure the integrity of freight shipments moving on NS, particularly those
moving to or from a foreign country.
 

Based on participation in C-TPAT, NS has ensured that its plan meets all
current applicable security recommendations made by U.S. Customs.

Similarly, NS is guided in
its operations by various supplemental security action items issued by DHS and U.S.
Department of Transportation (DOT), U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Security
requirements, as well as voluntary security action items developed in
collaboration with TSA, DOT, and the freight railroads in 2006.
 
Many of the action items are based on
lessons learned from DHS and DOT security assessments of rail corridors in High
Threat Urban Areas (HTUA) begun in 2004.
 

Particular attention is paid to: (1) the establishment of secure storage
areas for rail cars carrying toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) materials; (2) the
expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying TIH materials; (3)
the minimization of unattended loaded tank cars carrying TIH materials; and (4)
cooperation with federal, state, local and tribal governments to identify,
through risk assessments, those locations where security risks are the highest.
 
These action items and NS’
compliance initiatives are outlined in the various departmental sections of the
NS Departmental Security Plan.

In 2007, through
participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response
(TRANSCAER) Program, NS provided rail accident response training to
approximately 5,000 emergency responders, such as local police and fire
personnel, representing over 22,000 man-hours of emergency response
training.
 
NS’ other training
efforts throughout 2007 included participation in a major security drill with
Amtrak and the State of
Delaware
 in
New Castle
County
, as well as coordinating
table-top exercises involving the “staged” release of TIH shipments
with various local, state, and federal agencies.
 
NS also has ongoing programs to sponsor local
emergency responders at tank car emergency response training programs conducted
at the
AAR
Transportation


Technology
Center

in
Pueblo
,
Colorado
, and its annual TRANSCAER
Whistle-Stop train makes stops in numerous cities, its special training cars
serving as a resource to an audience of nearly 1,000 emergency responders
annually.

Improvements in equipment
design also are expected to play a role in enhancing rail security.
 
The
AAR

has developed new tank car specifications for chlorine and anhydrous ammonia
which are scheduled to become effective on March 31, 2008.
 
In the near future, the FRA is also
expected to issue a proposed regulation addressing the redesign of pressurized
tank cars used for the transportation of TIH gases and liquids.
 
A consortium of chemical companies is
also studying improvements in tank car head, shell, fittings, and thermal
protection in order to improve the survivability of current tank cars.

Item 1A.
 
Risk Factors.

NS is subject
to significant governmental regulation and legislation over commercial,
environmental and operating matters.

Railroads are subject to commercial regulation by the STB, which has
jurisdiction over some routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service and the
extension or abandonment of rail lines.
 

The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger or
acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers.
 
In addition, Congress could enact re-regulation legislation.
 
Economic re-regulation of the rail
industry by Congress could have a significant negative impact on NS’
ability to determine prices for rail services, reduce capital spending on its
rail network, and result in a material adverse effect in the future on
NS’ financial position, results of operations or liquidity in a particular
year or quarter.

Railroads
are subject to safety and security regulation by the DOT and the DHS, which
regulate most aspects of NS’ operations.
 
Proposed amendments to federal rail
safety statutes, if enacted, could add significantly to operating costs and
increase the number of employees NS and other railroads employ.
 
In addition, NS’ failure to comply
with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on
NS.

NS’
operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental
laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air;
discharges to water ways or ground water supplies; handling, storage,
transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and the cleanup of
hazardous material or petroleum releases. The risk of incurring environmental
liability – for acts and omissions, past, present and future – is
inherent in the railroad business.  Several of NS’ subsidiaries own,
or have owned, land used as operating property or held for sale, or which is
leased or may have been leased and operated by others.  Environmental
problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, and NS
could incur environmental liabilities or costs, the amount and materiality of
which cannot be estimated reliably at this time, with respect to one or more of
these properties.  Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving other
unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to
time, and the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on
financial position, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or
quarter.

NS, as a common carrier by rail, must offer to
transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk.

Transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic
losses in terms of personal injury and property damage costs, and compromise
critical parts of our rail network.
 

Legislation introduced in Congress would give federal regulators
increased authority to conduct investigations and levy substantial fines and
penalties in connection with railroad accidents.
 
Under provisions enacted in August 2007,
federal regulators are required to prescribe new regulations governing
railroads’ transportation of hazardous materials, including annual routing
analyses, security risk assessments and employee security training.
 
Regulations proposed in late 2006 by DHS
mandating chain of custody and security measures likely will cause service
degradation and higher costs for the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard
materials.
 
Further, certain local
governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving
by rail within their borders.
 
Some
legislators have contemplated pre-notification requirements for hazardous
materials shipments.
 
If promulgated
such ordinances could require the re-routing of hazardous materials shipments,
with the potential for significant additional costs and network inefficiencies.

NS
may be affected by terrorism or war.

Any terrorist
attack, or other similar event, any government response thereto, and war or
risk of war could cause significant business interruption and may adversely
affect NS’ results of operations, financial position, and liquidity in a
particular year or quarter.
 
Because
NS plays a critical role in the nation’s transportation system, it could
become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the
government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war.

Although NS
currently maintains insurance coverage for third-party liability arising out of
war and acts of terrorism, it maintains only limited insurance coverage for
first-party property damage and damage to property in NS’ care, custody
or control caused by certain acts of terrorism.
 
In addition, premiums for some or all of
NS’ current insurance programs covering these losses could increase
dramatically, or insurance coverage for certain losses may not be available to
NS in the future.

NS may be
affected by general economic conditions.

Prolonged negative
changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and
consumers of the commodities NS carries may have an adverse effect on its
operating results, financial position, and liquidity.
 
Economic conditions resulting in
bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a significant impact on NS’
financial position, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

NS
faces competition from other transportation providers.

NS is subject to competition from motor carriers, railroads, and
to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and pipelines, on the basis of transit time,
pricing, and the quality and reliability of service.
 
While NS has used primarily internal
resources to build or acquire and maintain its rail system, trucks and barges
have been able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any
future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or
reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in
which NS operates, or legislation granting materially greater latitude for
motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations, could have a
material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity
in a particular year or quarter.

The operations of carriers with which NS
interchanges may adversely affect its operations.

NS’ ability to provide rail service to customers in the U.S.
and Canada depends in large part upon its ability to maintain cooperative
relationships with connecting carriers with respect to, among other matters,
freight rates, revenue divisions, car supply and locomotive availability, data
exchange and communications, reciprocal switching, interchange and trackage
rights.
 
Deterioration in the
operations of, or service provided by connecting carriers, or in our
relationship with those connecting carriers,
could result in NS’ inability to meet its customers’
demands or require NS to use alternate train routes, which could result in
significant additional costs and network inefficiencies.

NS
relies on technology and technology improvements in its business operations.

If NS experiences significant disruption or failure of one or more
of its information technology systems, including computer hardware, software,
and communications equipment, NS could experience a service interruption,
security breach, or other operational difficulties, which could have a material
adverse impact on its results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity
in a particular year or quarter.
 

Additionally, if NS does not have sufficient capital to acquire new
technology or if it is unable to implement new technology, NS may suffer a
competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing
other modes of transportation service, which could have a material adverse
effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity in a
particular year or quarter.

The vast
majority of NS employees belong to labor unions, and labor agreements, strikes,
or work stoppages could adversely affect its operations.

A
pproximately 26,000, or
about 85%, of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining
agreements with various labor unions. 
If
unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown,
NS could experience a significant disruption of its operations.
 
Additionally, future national labor
agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor
agreements, could significantly increase NS’ costs for healthcare, wages,
and other benefits.
 
Any of these
factors could have a material adverse impact on NS’ financial position, results
of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

NS may be
subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.

The nature of NS’ business exposes it to the potential for
various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury,
commercial disputes, freight loss and other property damage, and other matters.

 
Job-related

personal injury and occupational
claims are subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), which
is applicable only to railroads.  FELA’s fault-based tort system
produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a
no-fault worker’s compensation system.
 
The variability inherent in this system
could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded.

Any material
changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving
any or all of freight loss or property damage, personal injury, and
environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on NS’
operating results, financial condition, and liquidity to the extent not covered
by insurance.
 
NS has obtained
insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party
property damages.
 
Specified levels
of risk are retained on a self-insurance basis (currently up to $25 million and
above $1 billion per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage to
third parties and $25 million and above $175 million per occurrence for
property owned by NS or in its care, custody or control).
 
Insurance is available from a limited
number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may
not be obtainable on terms acceptable to NS.

Severe weather could result
in significant business interruptions and expenditures.

Severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including
hurricanes and floods, may cause significant business interruptions and result
in increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues, which could
have an adverse effect on NS’ financial position, results of operations
or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

Unpredictability
of demand for rail services resulting in the unavailability of qualified
personnel could adversely affect NS’ operational efficiency and ability
to meet demand.

Workforce demographics, training
requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel, particularly
engineers and trainmen, could each have a negative impact on NS’ ability
to meet demand for rail service. Unpredictable increases in demand for rail
services may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on NS’
operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on its financial
position, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

NS may be affected by supply constraints
resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of its
supplier markets.

NS

consumes about 500 million gallons of diesel fuel each year.
 
Fuel availability could be affected by
any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation
or rationing regulations.
 
If a
severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments, disruption of
oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or
pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or otherwise, NS’ financial
position, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter
could be adversely affected.
 
Also,
such an event would impact NS as well as its customers and other transportation
companies.

Due to the capital intensive nature and industry-specific
requirements of the rail industry, there are high barriers of entry for
potential new suppliers of core railroad items, such as locomotives and rolling
stock equipment.
 
Additionally, NS
competes with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in
the production of certain track materials, such as rail and ties.
 
Changes in the competitive landscapes of
these limited-supplier markets could result in increased prices or material
shortages that could materially affect NS’ financial position, results of
operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

Legal Proceedings

..

As of Feb. 14,
2008, 28 antitrust class actions have been filed against NS and other
Class 1 railroads in various Federal district courts regarding fuel
surcharges.  On November 6, 2007, these actions were
consolidated in the
District of
  Columbia
 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation.  NS believes the allegations in the complaints are without
merit and intends to vigorously defend the cases.  In addition, NS
received a subpoena from a state grand jury on July 13, 2007, requesting
documents and materials relating to the setting of fuel surcharges.  NS is
cooperating with the state in its investigation.  NS does not believe that
the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on its financial position,
results of operations, or liquidity.

On November 30, 2007, NS
received notice from the United States Department of Justice
(DOJ) that the DOJ is prepared to bring an action against NS for
alleged violations of federal environmental laws resulting from the discharge
of chlorine and oil that occurred as a result of the Jan. 6, 2005
derailment in Graniteville, SC, including claims for civil penalties as well as
injunctive relief.  The notice further indicates that the State of
South Carolina
 may also
join in any action against NS.   NS is in discussions with
the DOJ in an effort to settle the DOJ's claims.  NS does not believe that
the resolution of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

On Oct. 19, 2006, the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PDEP) issued an assessment
of civil penalties against NS and filed a complaint for civil penalties with
the Pennsylvania Environmental Hearing Board (EHB) requesting that the EHB
impose civil penalties upon NS for alleged violations of state environmental
laws and regulations resulting from a discharge of sodium hydroxide that
occurred as a result of the derailment of a NS train in Norwich Township, Pennsylvania,
on June 30, 2006.
 
PDEP’s
actions sought to impose combined penalties of $8,890,000 for alleged past
violations and $46,420 per day for alleged continuing violations of state
environmental laws and regulations.
 

NS appealed the fines to the EHB.
 
The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission
sought financial restitution for damages alleged to have been caused by this
accident.
 
In addition, the
Pennsylvania Attorney General and the McKean County District Attorney filed
three misdemeanor charges for alleged violations of state environmental and
aquatic resource protection laws and regulations.
 
NS has entered into a settlement
agreement with all
Commonwealth

 of
Pennsylvania
 parties, pursuant
to which all claims by the Commonwealth for civil liability resulting from the
derailment and spill were resolved, with NS agreeing to pay approximately $7.35
million in restitution to compensate for all natural resource damages and the
agencies’ response costs caused by the derailment and spill.
 
NS has also pled no contest to the three
misdemeanor charges and has paid fines in the amount of $250,000 to resolve them.

  liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted by
Ohio
..
 

This benefit increased net income by $96 million, or 23 cents per
  diluted share.


2004 other income – net includes a $40 million
  net gain from the Conrail Corporate Reorganization.
 
This gain increased net income by $40
  million or 10 cents per diluted share.


2003 operating expenses
  include a $107 million charge for a voluntary separation program.
 
Other income – net includes an
  $84 million charge to recognize the impaired value of certain
  telecommunications assets.
 
These
  charges reduced net income by $119 million, or 30 cents per diluted share.


  discontinued operations relate to the 1998 sale of the common stock of motor
  carrier subsidiary, North American Van Lines, Inc.
 
Results in 2003 include an additional
  after-tax gain of $10 million, or 3 cents per diluted share, resulting from
  resolution of tax issues related to the transaction.


  net income reflects two accounting changes, the cumulative effect of which
  increased net income by $114 million, or 29 cents per diluted
  share:
 
a change in accounting for
  the cost to remove railroad crossties, which increased net income by $110
  million, and a change in accounting related to a special-purpose entity that
  leases certain locomotives to NS, which increased net income by $4 million.


  long-term debt excludes notes payable to Conrail of $716 million.

Management's Discussion and
Analysis of

Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and the Selected Financial Data.

OVERVIEW

NS’ 2007 results reflected softness in the
overall economy that resulted in reduced traffic volumes.
 
Despite this, railway operating revenues
increased slightly as improved average revenue per unit offset the volume
declines.
 
Railway operating
expenses were about even, resulting in a railway operating ratio (a measure of
the amount of revenues consumed by operating expenses) of 72.6%, which improved
modestly from 2006.

Cash provided by operating activities exceeded
$2 billion for the third consecutive year and, along with a reduction in
cash and short-term investment balances, provided funding for increased capital
expenditures, significant share repurchases and higher dividends.

Loo
ki
ng
ahead, NS expects revenues to continue to grow, reflecting higher average
revenue per unit and modestly higher traffic volume, particularly later in 2008
provided the overall economy improves.
 

NS plans to continue to improve service and maintain a market-based
approach to pricing.

During 2007, NS purchased and retired
23.6 million shares of NS common stock at a total cost of $1.2 billion
under the share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors on Nov.
22, 2005.
 
The Board of Directors
amended the program in March 2007 and authorized the repurchase of up to
75 million shares of NS common stock through Dec. 31, 2010.
 
In total, NS has purchased and retired
45.3 million shares under this program at a total cost of
$2.2 billion.

SUMMARIZED
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2007 Compared with 2006

Net income in 2007 was $1.5
billion, down $17 million, or 1%, compared with 2006.
 
Diluted earnings per share were $3.68,
up $0.11, or 3%, reflecting fewer shares outstanding as a result of NS’ share
repurchase program (see Note 13).
 

The decrease in net income was primarily due to higher income taxes and
lower non‑operating items that offset higher income from railway
operations.
 
Railway operating
revenues increased $25 million, as higher average revenue per unit overshadowed
lower traffic volumes.
 
Railway
operating expenses decreased $3 million, principally due to lower volume-related
expenses that offset higher fuel expense.

2006 Compared with 2005

Net income in 2006 was $1.5
billion, or $3.57 per diluted share, up $200 million, or 16%, compared with $1.3 billion,
or $3.11 per diluted share, in 2005.
 

The increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from
railway operations, offset in part by the absence of the $96 million income tax
benefit recorded in 2005 because of
Ohio

tax law changes (see Note 3).
 

Railway operating revenues increased $880 million, reflecting higher
rates, including fuel surcharges that accounted for about 40% of the increase, and
modestly higher traffic volume.
 

Railway operating expenses rose $440 million, or 7%, principally due to
higher fuel prices and increased compensation and benefit costs.

Revenues increased $25 million in 2007 and $880 million
in 2006.
 
Automotive revenue in 2007
included $26 million related to a contract volume settlement.
 
As shown in the following table, the increase
in 2007 was due to higher average revenue per unit that more than offset
decreased traffic volumes, whereas the improvement in 2006 was the result of
increased average revenue per unit and higher traffic volumes.

Both comparisons reflect
large increases in average revenue per unit, a result of higher rates.
 
In 2006 about 40% of the revenue
increase was attributable to higher fuel surcharges.
 
Traffic volume decreased in 2007,
reflecting declines in all commodity groups except agriculture/consumer
products/government, and chemicals.
 

In 2006, traffic volume rose 1%, principally due to higher intermodal
and metals/construction shipments.

On January 26, 2007, the Surface
Transportation Board (STB) issued a decision that the type of fuel surcharge
imposed by NS and most other large railroads – a fuel surcharge based on
a percentage of line haul revenue – would no longer be permitted for
regulated traffic that moves under public (tariff) rates.
 
The STB gave the railroads a 90‑day
transition period to adjust their fuel surcharge programs.
 
During the second quarter, NS discontinued
assessing fuel surcharges on its published (non-intermodal) public rates.
 
Future adjustments to public prices will
reflect ongoing market conditions.
 
NS
does not expect that compliance with the new STB regulations will have a
material effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
 
The traffic moving under these tariffs
and public quotes comprised less than 10% of
Norfolk
 Southern’s total revenue base.

COAL

revenues decreased $15
million, or 1%, compared with 2006, as a 2% reduction in tonnage handled more
than offset a 3% increase in average revenue per unit.
 
Carloads declined 3%, a higher
percentage than the change in tonnage handled because of increased average
tonnage per car.
 
Coal represented 25%
of NS’ revenues in 2007, and 78% of shipments handled originated on
NS’ lines.
 
As shown in the
following table, decreased shipments of utility and domestic metallurgical coal
more than offset higher export and industrial shipments.

Coal

revenues in 2006 increased $215
million, or 10%, compared with 2005, which reflected higher average revenue per
unit and slightly higher traffic volume.
 

Coal average revenue per unit was up 9% compared with 2005, reflecting increased
fuel surcharges and higher rates, tempered by the absence of a $55 million
benefit from coal rate settlements in the second quarter of 2005.
 
Coal represented 25% of NS’
revenues in 2006, and 79% of shipments handled originated on NS’
lines.
 
Traffic volumes rose 1%,
primarily because of increased shipments of utility and domestic metallurgical
coal that offset lower export and iron ore shipments.

NS is currently involved in
litigation with Virginia Electric and Power Company/Old Dominion Electric
Cooperative (Virginia Power) regarding rate adjustment provisions in a
transportation contract between them.
 

During the second quarter of 2007, the Virginia Supreme Court issued a
decision that remanded the case to the trial court on the grounds that neither
of its prior decisions constituted a final order.
 
Future developments and the ultimate
resolution of this matter could result in NS recognizing additional
revenues related to this dispute, which could have a favorable impact on
results of operations in a particular year or quarter.

Utility
coal

tonnage decreased 4%, compared with 2006, reflecting high stockpile levels (particularly
in the Southeast) that led to reduced shipments, despite fairly strong electric
generation (up 4%) in the NS service region.
 
In addition, the temporary closure of a
major coal mine as well as the loss of business to barge transportation contributed
to the decline.

In
2006, utility coal tonnage increased 4%, compared with 2005, reflecting the
rebuilding of stockpiles by customers, more shipments from the
Powder
River Basin

in the West and higher shipments of import coal through
Charleston
,
SC.

A
number of evolving environmental issues could affect the utility coal
market.
 
These include potential
regional programs aimed at capping and reducing power plant CO


emissions, and ongoing efforts at addressing
climate change.
 
In response to
changes in environmental regulations, certain utilities have begun adding or
are planning to add emissions control technologies to their electric generating
units, allowing them to utilize their existing coal-fired power plants.

In
2008, demand for utility coal is expected to be mixed, with declining utility
inventories in the Northeast stimulating growth but above normal stockpiles in
the Southeast mitigating the growth.

Domestic
metallurgical

coal, coke and iron ore tonnage decreased 14% in 2007 compared with 2006.
 
The decrease was primarily due to coke
furnace outages, mine production outages and reduced spot iron ore traffic.

Domestic
metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore tonnage increased 4% in 2006 compared
with 2005.
 
The increase was
driven by higher domestic metallurgical coal and coke shipments in the first
half of the year in response to steel-ma
ki
ng
demand, which more than offset a decline in iron ore volume caused by the
shutdown of a blast furnace at a major customer location.

In
2008, domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore demand is expected to be
comparable to 2007 for the first half of the year; however, demand is expected
to increase in the second half due to plant expansions.

Export coal

tonnage in 2007 increased 25%
compared to 2006, primarily due to increased demand reflecting a lower valued
dollar as well as loading delays at Australian ports.
 
Norfolk

volume increased by approximately 26,000 cars, or 25%, and
Baltimore
 volume was up approximately 4,500
cars, or 19%.

In
2006, export coal tonnage decreased 15% compared to 2005, reflecting weaker demand
for
U.S.
 coal as Europe and
Asia
 continued to increase purchases from other countries.
 
Baltimore

volume was down approximately 13,500 cars, or 37%, and
Norfolk
 volume declined by approximately
3,000 cars, or 3%.

In
2008, export coal tonnage is expected to increase, reflecting increased global
demand.

Other
coal

tonnage (principally steam coal shipped to industrial plants) increased 6%
versus 2006, primarily due to new business and stronger demand.
 
In 2006, other coal tonnage decreased 3%
versus 2005, primarily due to plant closures and mine production problems.

GENERAL
MERCHANDISE

revenues increased $90 million, or 2%, in 2007 compared with 2006, as a 6%
increase in average revenue per unit, reflecting continued market-based pricing
in all groups, more than offset a 4% decline in traffic volume.
 
Revenue in 2007 included
$26 million related to a volume-related contract settlement with an
automotive customer.

In 2006, general merchandise revenues increased $520
million, or 11%, compared with 2005, as all market groups posted higher average
revenue per unit driven by increased rates and fuel surcharges.
 
Traffic volume declined slightly as improved
metals and construction and agriculture volumes were offset by declines in the other
business groups.

Chemicals

revenue increased 8% compared with 2006, reflecting
higher rates in all groups.
 
Traffic
volume rose modestly as more shipments of industrial intermediates offset fewer
shipments in the petroleum, miscellaneous chemicals and plastics markets, which
continued to reflect weakness in housing-related demand.

In 2006, chemicals revenues increased 10%, despite a
4% drop in traffic volume, reflecting increased rates and fuel surcharges.
 
Petroleum, industrial and plastics
traffic volumes were down as a result of lower inventories arising from
post-Katrina conditions, the closure of several plants on NS lines and the
weaker housing and automotive markets.

In 2008, chemicals revenue is expected to improve,
principally due to increased average revenue per unit as volumes are expected
to be comparable to 2007.

Metals and construction

revenue decreased 2% in
2007 as a 5% increase in average revenue per unit that resulted from higher
rates was more than offset by the effects of a 6% decrease in traffic volume.
 
The decline in volume was principally
due to lower iron, steel and coil shipments and reduced demand for construction
materials, both reflecting the soft automotive and housing sectors.

In 2006, metals and construction revenue increased 19%
and traffic volume increased 5% compared with 2005 as declines in the fourth
quarter were offset by higher volumes through the rest of the year.
 
Revenue per unit rose

14% because of increased rates and fuel
surcharges.
 
The increase in traffic
volume was driven primarily by higher import slab business to NS-served steel
mills, more scrap metal shipments and higher sand, gravel and cement traffic
for commercial and highway construction projects.

In 2008, metals and construction revenues are
expected to grow as a result of higher traffic volumes, principally due to new
business, and improved average revenue per unit.
 
However, growth could be somewhat dampened
by the continued softness of the automotive and housing markets.

Agriculture,
consumer products and government

revenue increased 5% in 2007 compared with 2006.
 
The revenue improvement resulted from higher
average revenue per unit, which reflected higher rates.
 
Traffic volume rose modestly as more corn,
fertilizer and ethanol shipments were mitigated by less government and consumer
product volume.

In
2006, agriculture, consumer products and government revenue increased 19% and
traffic volume increased 4% compared with 2005.
 
Average revenue per unit rose 15%, a
result of higher rates and fuel surcharges.
 
Traffic volume growth resulted from
increased ethanol, military and corn shipments.
 
Military traffic growth was primarily
due to the continued support of military operations in
Iraq
..

Agriculture revenue is expected to continue to grow
in 2008, benefiting from increasing demand for biofuel products including corn,
soybeans and ethanol, as well as higher rates.
 
However, lower volumes in consumer
products are expected to partially offset this growth.

Automotive

revenues were flat in 2007 compared with 2006 as lower
traffic volumes offset higher average revenue per unit.
 
Revenue in 2007 included a
$26 million volume-related contract settlement.
 
Volume decreased 5%, reflecting softness
in demand for vehicles as well as parts, and the closure in June 2007 of an
NS-served plant.

In 2006, automotive revenues declined 2% compared
with 2005 as lower volumes offset increased average revenue per unit, including
fuel surcharges.
 
Volume decreased 9%
primarily due to substantial production cuts at Ford, General Motors and Daimler-Chrysler
assembly plants, including two NS-served plant closures at Ford and one at
General Motors during 2006.
 
Reduced
production at Honda and BMW also contributed to the volume decrease.

For 2008, automotive revenues are expected to be
lower, reflecting continued production cutbacks and weak demand.

Paper, clay and forest products

revenue decreased 3% in
2007 compared with 2006 as the effects of higher average revenue per unit were
more than offset by an 8% decrease in traffic volume reflecting the continued
housing slowdown and decline in conventional paper markets.

In 2006, paper, clay and forest products revenue
increased 11% compared with 2005 due to higher average revenue per unit, including
fuel surcharges, despite a 1% decrease in traffic volume.
 
Higher solid waste and debris traffic, and
growth in traffic from the import of printing paper, partially offset reduced
pulp and pulp board shipments.

In 2008, paper, clay and forest products revenues
are expected to be about even as growth in waste and debris transportation and higher
revenue per unit are expected to be tempered by continued weakness in
housing-related markets.

INTERMODAL

revenues decreased $50 million, or 3%, compared with
2006, as a 4% reduction in traffic volumes offset a 2% increase in average
revenue per unit.
 
Truckload volume decreased 10% compared with

2006 and domestic intermodal marketing companies
(IMC) volume declined 4%.
 
Traffic
volume for Triple Crown Services Company (Triple Crown), a service with
rail-to-highway trailers, dropped 3%.
 

The declines for truckload, IMC and Triple Crown were primarily due to
lower national demand for dry van shipments resulting from continued weakness
in the housing and automotive markets and increased over-the-road competition.
 
International traffic volume decreased 4%
reflecting reduced shipments of empty containers and less inland rail
transportation of West Coast port traffic, which offset volume growth from East
Coast port traffic.
 
Premium
business, which includes parcel and LTL (less-than-truckload) carriers, was up
2% reflecting gains in parcel shipments that offset modest declines in LTL
shipper traffic.

In 2006, intermodal revenues
increased $145 million, or 8%, compared with 2005, largely because of higher
fuel surcharges, increased rates and improved traffic volume.
 
Traffic volume for the year rose 3% notwithstanding
a 3% decline in the fourth quarter.
 

Truckload volume increased 8%
reflecting continued expansion of business with traditional truckload
companies.
  
IMC volume
declined 9%, a result of declines in the housing, construction and automotive
markets.
 
Triple Crown Services
Company had flat volume compared with 2005 as higher consumer product shipments
were offset by weaker automotive-related shipments.
 
International traffic volume rose 9%
reflecting growth in imported goods from
Asia

and exported goods through NS-served East Coast ports, as well as West Coast
ports.
 
Premium business was down 3%
as lower LTL shipper traffic offset modest gains in parcel shipments.
 
Intermodal revenue per unit
increased 4%, principally a result of higher fuel surcharges as well as
increased rates and longer-haul international traffic, which was offset in part
by the ongoing shift of shipments from higher revenue per unit, rail-provided
assets (trailers and containers) to lower revenue per unit shipments in
shipper-provided equipment.

For 2008, intermodal revenue
is expected to show improvement bolstered by higher average revenue per unit
and modest improvement in volumes.

Railway
Operating Expenses

Railway
operating expenses in 2007 were $6.8 billion, about even with expenses in 2006,
which were up $440 million compared to 2005.
 
The 2007 comparison reflected
volume-related decreases offset by higher fuel expense.
 
The increase in 2006 was due to higher
fuel prices and increased compensation and benefits.

The
railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of railway operating
revenues consumed by railway operating expenses, improved to 72.6% in 2007,
compared with 72.8% in 2006 and 75.2% in 2005.

The following table shows the changes in railway
operating expenses summarized by major classifications (prior year amounts have

Compensation
and benefits

,
which represents 37% of total railway operating expenses, decreased $85 million,
or 3%, compared with 2006, primarily due to lower incentive compensation (down
$48 million), lower volume-related payroll (down $37 million), the absence
of the prior year retirement and waiver agreements with former executives as
well as the cost of the regular stock-based grant to the former Chief Executive
Officer ($24 million), lower stock-based compensation (down $13 million), and
lower payroll taxes (down $12 million), that were partially offset by
increased wage rates (up $27 million) and higher medical costs (up $27 million).

In
2006, compensation and benefits increased $144 million, or 6%, compared
with 2005.
 
Expenses in 2006
included the effect of the implementation of Statement of Accounting Standards
No. 123(R) “Share-Based Payment,” which increased stock-based
compensation expense by $27 million.
 

Most of the increase was reflected in the first quarter which included
the effect of accelerated recognition of costs related to grants to
retirement-eligible employees.
 
The
remaining increase was attributable to increased salaries and wages (up $44 million),
higher health and welfare benefit costs (up $29 million), retirement and
waiver agreements entered into in the first quarter as well as the cost of the
regular stock-based grant to the former chief executive officer who retired (up
$24 million), and higher payroll taxes (up $17 million).

NS
employment averaged 30,806 in 2007 compared with 30,541 in 2006 and 30,294 in
2005.
 
The increased number of employees
was almost exclusively in operating department personnel to meet service needs,
as well as to prepare for expected retirements.
 
NS continues to hire and train
additional workers in order to meet the requirements of forecasted volumes in
light of the demographics of its work force.

Purchased
services and rents

includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors,
including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other
railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals.
 
This category of expenses decreased $27 million,
or 2%, in 2007 compared to 2006, but increased $31 million, or 2%, in 2006
compared to 2005.
 
The decline in 2007
was principally due to lower equipment rents, while the 2006 increase reflected
increased maintenance activities.

Purchased
services costs were $1,172 million in 2007, $1,165 million in 2006
and $1,142 million in 2005.
 
In
2007, higher expenses for maintenance activities were largely offset by
volume-related declines.
 
The
increase in 2006 reflected higher intermodal volume-related expenses.

Equipment
rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars)
owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to NS for the use
of its equipment, amounted to $379 million, $413 million and
$405 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
 
The decrease in 2007 was principally due
to lower shipment volumes.
 
The
increase in 2006 was primarily due to a reduction in rents received on automotive
equipment as a result of decreased shipments.

Fuel

expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel
as well as other fuel used in railway operations, increased $74 million,
or 7%, in 2007 compared with 2006, and increased $274 million, or 33%, in
2006 compared with 2005.
 
Fuel
expense is recorded net of hedge benefits, although there have been no such
benefits since May 2006 when the program wound down (see “Market Risks
and Hedging Activities,” below and Note 16).
 
The increase in 2007 reflected a 9%
increase in the price per gallon of locomotive fuel as well as the absence of
hedge benefits offset in part by a 4% decline in consumption.
 
Expense in 2006 included hedge benefits
of $20 million compared with benefits of $148 million in 2005, and reflected
a 13% rise in the average price per gallon with a 1% increase in consumption.

Legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2005
repealed the 4.3 cents per gallon excise tax on railroad diesel fuel for 2007,
with the following phased reductions in 2005 and 2006: 1 cent per gallon from
Jan. 1, 2005 through June 30, 2005; 2 cents per gallon from July 1, 2005
through Dec. 31, 2006; and by the full 4.3 cents thereafter.
 
NS consumes about 500 million gallons of
locomotive diesel fuel per year.

Depreciation

expense increased $37 million, or 5%, in 2007
compared to 2006, but decreased $36 million, or 5%, in 2006 compared with
2005.
 
In both years, substantial
capital investments and improvements resulted in higher depreciation
expense.
 
The net decrease in 2006 reflected
the results of an equipment depreciation study and an analysis of the assets
received in the Conrail Corporation Reorganization completed in 2006.

Materials and other

expenses (including the
estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage and
environmental matters) decreased $2 million in 2007 compared with 2006, but
increased $27 million, or 3%, in 2006 compared to 2005, as shown in the
following table.

The decline in 2007 was primarily due to lower
derailment and personal injury costs, offset in part by higher property and
other taxes, and increased materials costs for maintenance activities.

The increase in 2006 reflected increased locomotive
and freight car repair costs due to more maintenance activity related to higher
usage from increased traffic volumes coupled with the age of the fleet, as well
as higher expenses arising from derailments and insurance costs.
 
These increases were partially offset by
the absence of $38 million of costs associated with the 2005 derailment in
Graniteville
,
South
  Carolina
, and an unfavorable jury verdict in an
employee injury case.

In 2005, NS recorded a
liability related to the
Jan.
 6, 2005
 derailment in
Graniteville
,

SC.
 
The liability, which includes a current
and long-term portion, represents NS’ best estimate based on
current facts and circumstances.
 

The estimate includes amounts related to business property damage and
other economic losses, personal injury and individual property damage
claims as well as third-party response costs.
 
NS’ commercial insurance policies
are expected to cover substantially all expenses related to this derailment
above NS’ self-insured retention, including NS’ response costs and
legal fees.
 
Accordingly, the
Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect a current and long-term receivable for estimated
recoveries from NS’ insurance carriers.
 
While it is reasonable to expect that
the liability for covered losses could differ from the amount recorded,
such a change would be offset by a corresponding change in the insurance
receivable.
 
As a result, NS does
not believe that it is reasonably likely that its net loss (the difference
between the liability and future recoveries) will be materially different than
the loss previously recorded.
 
NS
expects at this time that insurance coverage is adequate to cover potential
claims and settlements above its self-insurance retention.

The largest component of casualties and other claims
expense is personal injury costs.
 

Cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 60% of total
employee injury cases resolved and about 40% of total payments made.
 
With its long-established commitment to
safety, NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to
reduce the associated costs.
 
With
respect to occupational injuries, which are not caused by a specific accident
or event but result from a claimed exposure over time, the benefits of any
existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately.
 
These types of claims are being asserted
by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in
the rail industry for decades.

The
rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job-related
accidental injury and occupational claims because of the Federal Employers'
Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads.
 
FELA’s fault-based system, which
covers employee claims for job-related injuries, produces results that are
unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault workers' compensation
system.

NS maintains substantial amounts of insurance for
potential third-party liability and property damage claims.
 
It also retains reasonable levels of
risk through self-insurance (see Note 17).
 

NS expects insurance costs to be slightly higher in 2008.

Other Income – Net

Other income – net
 was $93 million in 2007, $149
million in 2006 and $74 million in 2005 (see Note 2).
 
The decrease in 2007 reflected lower
interest income ($31 million), higher expenses associated with synthetic
fuel-related tax credit investments ($15 million) and lower returns from
corporate-owned life insurance ($15 million) that combined to offset higher
equity in earnings of Conrail ($20 million).

NS
has membership interests representing ownership in companies that owned and
operated facilities that produced synthetic fuel from coal.
 
In addition, NS purchased two facilities
that produced synthetic fuel from coal in 2007.
 
The production of synthetic fuel resulted
in tax credits as well as expenses related to the investments.
 
The expenses are recorded as a component
of “Other income – net,” and the tax credits, as well as tax
benefits related to the expenses, are reflected in “Provision for income
taxes” (see discussion below).

Results in 2006 reflected lower expense associated
with tax credit investments primarily due to synthetic fuel related
investments, greater interest income, and higher returns from corporate-owned
life insurance, that were partially offset by lower equity in Conrail
earnings.

Income
Taxes

Income
tax expense in 2007 was $773 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared
with effective rates of 34% in 2006 and 25% in 2005.
 
The increase in the rate for 2007
largely resulted from
Illinois

tax legislation which increased deferred taxes by $19 million (see Note 3).
 
The increase in the rate for 2006 was primarily
due to the absence of an
Ohio

tax law change that lowered the effective rate in 2005 as well as fewer tax
credits from synthetic fuel-related investments.
 
Synthetic fuel tax credits were
available through the end of 2007.

Synthetic
fuel credits are subject to reduction if the Reference Price of a barrel of oil
for the year falls within an inflation-adjusted phase-out range specified by
the tax code.
 
The Reference Price for a year is the annual average
wellhead price per barrel of unregulated domestic crude oil as determined by
the Secretary of the Treasury by April 1 of the following year.
 
In 2006, the phase-out range was $55.06
to $69.12, and the phase-out range is adjusted annually for inflation.
 
While NS cannot predict with certainty
the Reference Price for the year, NS estimated a 66
% phase-out of synthetic
fuel credits in 2007 based on actual oil prices during the year.

Net
income in 2007 reflects $5 million less in net benefits from these credits, as
compared with the same period of 2006, as shown below:

The
tax credits generated by NS’ synthetic fuel related investments, which
reduced the effective tax rate by 3% in 2007 and 2006, and 6% in 2005, expired
at the end of 2007 and, accordingly, the effective tax rate is expected to
increase in 2008 (see Note 3).

NS’
consolidated federal income tax returns for 2004 and 2005 are being audited by
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
 

The IRS completed its examination of the 2002 and 2003 consolidated
federal income tax returns during the third quarter of 2006 and NS has appealed
certain adjustments proposed by the IRS.
 

The results of the examination had a negligible effect on the effective
tax rate.

FINANCIAL
CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash provided by operating activities,

NS' principal source of liquidity,
was $2.3 billion in 2007, compared with $2.2 billion in 2006 and $2.1
billion in 2005.
 
The improvement in
2007 resulted from favorable changes in wor
ki
ng
capital as well as the modest improvement in income from railway operations.
 
In 2006, higher income from railway
operations was partially offset by higher income tax payments.
 
NS had a wor
ki
ng
capital deficit of $273 million at Dec. 31, 2007, compared with wor
ki
ng capital of $307 million at Dec. 31, 2006.
 
The change was largely the result of reduced
cash and short-term investments that were used to repurchase stock.
 
NS expects that cash on hand combined
with cash flow provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet its
ongoing obligations.
 
NS’
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances totaled $206 million
and $918 million at
Dec. 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Contractual obligations

at Dec. 31, 2007, comprised
of NS' long-term debt (including capital leases) (see Note 7), operating
leases (see Note 8), agreements with CRC (see Note 4), unconditional purchase
obligations (see Note 17), long-term advances from Conrail (see Note 4)
and unrecognized tax benefits (see Note 3) were as follows:

Cash used for investing activities

was $1 billion in 2007,
compared with $684 million in 2006 and $1.8 billion in 2005.
 
The increase in 2007 primarily reflected
lower net proceeds from short-term investment sales and purchases and increased
property additions.
 
The decrease in
2006 reflected higher proceeds from short-term investment sales, principally to
fund share repurchases reflected in financing activities, offset in part by the
$100 million investment in Meridian Speedway LLC (MSLLC) (see discussion below)
and increased property additions.

Property
additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category.

For 2008, NS has budgeted
$1.43 billion for capital expenditures.
 

The anticipated spending includes $613 million for rail, crosstie,
ballast and bridge programs, and $339 million is provided for infrastructure
and expansion investments, including increased mainline capacity, track
upgrades and expansions to accommodate new customers or traffic and large
network public/private partnership investments such as the Heartland Corridor
and Chicago CREATE programs (see discussion below).
 
Norfolk

Southern expects to spend approximately $143 million on intermodal
terminals and equipment to add capacity to the intermodal network, increased
access and capacity for coal and merchandise traffic, and bulk transfer
facilities.
 
Planned equipment
spending of $264 million provides $119 million for locomotives, including the
purchase of 15 new units and continued spending on improvements to the
locomotive fleet.
 
Approximately
$145 million will be spent on freight cars, including the acquisition of 1,330
new higher capacity coal cars as part of a multi-year program to replace the
existing coal car fleet, the purchase of 321 freight cars upon their lease
expiration, 163 multi-level automobile racks and improvements to
multi-level racks.
Norfolk

Southern also expects to spend $66 million related to computers, systems
and information technology.
 
NS
expects to make all of its capital expenditures with internally generated
funds.

The Meridian Speedway is a 320 mile rail line
between
Meridian
,
Mississippi

and
Shreveport
,
Louisiana
..
 
On May 1, 2006, NS and Kansas City
Southern (KCS) formed a joint venture (MSLLC) pursuant to which NS expects to
contribute $300 million in cash, substantially all of which will be used
for capital improvements over a period of approximately three years, in
exchange for a 30% interest in the joint venture.
 
To date, NS has contributed
$240 million.
 
At the formation
of MSLLC, KCS contributed the Meridian Speedway.
 
NS is recognizing its pro rata share of
the joint venture’s earnings or loss as required under the equity method
of accounting.
 
NS’ total
investment in MSLLC is supported by the fair value of the rail line as well as
intangible assets obtained through the transaction.
 
The joint venture is expected to
increase capacity and improve service over the Meridian Speedway into the
Southeast.

The Heartland Corridor is a package of proposed
clearance improvements and other facilities that will create a seamless
high-capacity intermodal route across
Virginia

and
West Virginia
 to
Midwest

markets.
 
During 2006, with respect
to the tunnel clearance component of the Heartland Corridor, NS and the states
of
Ohio
,
West Virginia

and
Virginia

each entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Federal Highway
Administration that governs the release of up to $95 million in authorized
federal funding.
 
In 2006, NS also
entered into agreements with two states governing the use of up to $11 million
in state funding for the Heartland Corridor rail double-stack clearance
project.
 
NS expects to spend about
$60 million in connection with this project.
 
NS began work on the Heartland Corridor tunnel
clearances in October 2007 and the entire project is expected to be completed
by 2010.

The Chicago Region
Environmental and Transportation Efficiency (CREATE) project is a
public-private partnership to reduce rail and highway congestion and add
freight and passenger capacity in the metropolitan
Chicago
 area.
 
NS and other railroads have agreed to
participate in CREATE.
 
A portion of
the public funding has been approved and the parties have developed a list of
projects to be included in Phase I of the project.
 
A total of $100 million in public
funding has been secured for Phase I and the railroads have contributed an
additional $100 million.
 
The
railroads expect to complete Phase I over the next three years.
 
As currently planned, the total project
is estimated to cost $1.5 billion with city, state and federal
support.
 
If additional public
funding is secured, the railroads are expected to contribute a total of
$232 million towards the entire project with NS’ share slated to be
$34 million.

Cash
used for financing activities

was $1.6 billion in 2007, compared with $1.3 billion in 2006 and $456 million
in 2005.
 
The increases reflected
higher share repurchases as a part of NS’ ongoing share repurchase
program (see Note 13), as well as higher debt repayments and increased dividend
payments.
 
Financing activities in
2007 include $250 million of proceeds from NS’ receivable securitization
facility (see Note 7).

Share repurchases totaled $1.2 billion in 2007
and $964 million in 2006 for the purchase and retirement of 23.6 million
shares and 21.7 million shares, respectively, of common stock as part of
NS’ ongoing share repurchase program.
 
In March 2007, NS’
Board of Directors amended NS’ share repurchase program by increasing the
authorized amount of share repurchases from 50 million to 75 million
shares and shortening the authorized period from 2015 to 2010.
 
The timing and volume of purchases is
guided by management’s assessment of market conditions and other
pertinent facts.
 
To date, almost
all of the purchases under the program have been made with internally generated
cash.
 
However, future funding
sources are expected to include proceeds from the issuance of debt, including
the use of the receivable securitization program (see Note 7).
 
Dependent on economic and market
conditions, NS expects to purchase and retire a similar amount of shares in
2008.

NS has in place and available a $1 billion,
five-year credit agreement expiring in 2012, which provides for borrowings at
prevailing rates and includes financial covenants.
 
There were no amounts outstanding under this
facility at Dec. 31, 2007, and NS is in compliance with all of the financial
covenants.
 
NS also has in place two
shelf registration statements on Form S-3 filed with the SEC in March 2001 and September
2004 under which up to $700 million of additional debt or equity securities
could be issued
(see
Note 7).

Loo
ki
ng
forward, NS expects to refinance maturing debt over the next several years and
modestly increase current debt levels.
 

Overall, NS’ goal is to maintain a capital structure with
appropriate leverage to support NS’ business strategy and provide
flexibility through business cycles.

APPLICATION
OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with
U.S.
 generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
 
These estimates and assumptions may
require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and
future events are likely to occur that may require management to change
them.
 
Accordingly, management
regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical
experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that
management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
 
Management regularly discusses the
development, selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates
with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.
 
There have been no significant changes to the
Application of Critical Accounting Estimates disclosure contained in NS’
Form 10‑K as of Dec. 31, 2007, with the exception of the adoption of
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” which is discussed
below in “New Accounting Pronouncements” and in Note 3.

Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits

Accounting
for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make
several estimates and assumptions (see Note 10).
 
These include the expected rate of
return from investment of the plans' assets, projected increases in medical
costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected
earnings and mortality.
 
In addition,
the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment
because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value.
 
Management makes these estimates based
on the company's historical experience and other information that it deems
pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock
market performance).
 
Management utilizes
an independent consulting actuarial firm’s studies to assist it in
selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities.

NS' net pension benefit, which is included in
“Compensation and benefits” on its Consolidated Statements of Income,
was $40 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2007.
 
In recording this amount, NS assumed a
long-term investment rate of return of 9%.
 

Investment experience of the pension fund over the past 10-, 15- and
20-year periods has been a rate of return in excess of 10% and supports the
current rate of return assumption.
 

A one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would
result in a $19 million change to the pension credit and, as a result, an
equal change in “Compensation and benefits” expense.
 
Changes that are reasonably likely to
occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings and
mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on NS' net pension
benefit or net pension asset in the future.
 
The net pension asset is recorded at its
net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest
rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments.
 
In 2007, NS utilized an analysis in
which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement
benefit plans were matched with a yield curve based on an appropriate universe
of high-quality corporate bonds.
 
NS
used the results of the yield curve to select the discount rate that matches
the payment stream of the benefits in these plans.
 
Previously, NS referred to Moody’s
seasoned Aa corporate bond yields and the changes in such yields in
establishing the discount rate.

NS' net cost for other postretirement benefits,
which is also included in “Compensation and benefits,” was $76 million
for the year ended Dec. 31, 2007.
 

In recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other
postretirement benefits, which is included in “Other postretirement benefits”
as disclosed in Note 10,

management estimated future increases in health-care
costs.
 
These assumptions, along
with the effect of a one percentage point change in them, are described in Note
10.

Properties
and Depreciation

Most
of NS' total assets are comprised of long-lived railway properties (see Note 5).
 
As disclosed in Note 1, NS'
properties are depreciated using group depreciation.
 
Rail is depreciated primarily on the
basis of use measured by gross-ton miles.
 

Other properties are depreciated generally using the straight-line
method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives.
 
NS reviews the carrying amount of
properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such
carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash
flows.
 
Assets that are deemed
impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying
amount or fair value.

NS'
depreciation expense is based on management's assumptions concerning service
lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be
received upon their retirement.
 
In
developing these assumptions, NS’ management utilizes periodic
depreciation studies that are performed by an outside firm of consulting
engineers.
 
These studies analyze
NS' historical patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any
expected change in operation or maintenance practices.
 
NS' recent experience with these studies
has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate
its properties, these changes have not caused a significant effect to its
annual depreciation expense.
 
The
studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation
is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study.
 
Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized
as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the
affected class of property.
 
NS' depreciation
expense for the year ended Dec. 31, 2007, amounted to $775 million.
 
NS' weighted-average depreciation rates
for 2007 are disclosed in Note 5; a one-tenth percentage point increase (or
decrease) in these rates would have resulted in a $27 million increase (or
decrease) to NS' depreciation expense.

Personal
Injury, Environmental and Legal Liabilities

NS'
expense for casualties and other claims, included in “Materials and
other,” amounted to $171 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2007.
 
Most of this expense was composed of NS'
accrual related to personal injury liabilities.
 
Job-related personal injury and
occupational claims are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to
railroads.
 
FELA’s fault-based
tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as
compared with a no-fault worker’s compensation system.
 
The variability inherent in this system
could result in actual costs being very different from the liability
recorded.
 
In all cases, NS records
a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and
estimable.

To
aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to
accrue during the year, NS’ management utilizes studies prepared by an
independent consulting actuarial firm.
 

For employee personal injury cases, the actuarial firm studies NS'
historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, ta
ki
ng into account relevant outside influences.
 
An estimate of the ultimate amount of
the liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims, is
based on the results of this analysis.
 

For occupational injury claims, the actuarial firm studies NS’
history of claim filings, severity, payments and other relevant facts.
 
Additionally, the estimate of the
ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims
that have been incurred but not reported by projecting NS’ experience
into the future as far as can be reasonably determined.
 
NS has recorded this actuarially
determined liability.
 
The liability
is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case
reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in
the periodic studies.
 
Accordingly,
there could be significant changes in the liability, which NS would recognize
when such a change became known.
 

The most recent actuarial study, completed in the fourth quarter of 2007,
resulted in a decrease to NS' personal injury liability during the fourth
quarter.
 
While the liability
recorded is
support
ed by the most
recent study, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate liability could be
higher or lower.

NS
is subject to various jurisdictions' environmental laws and regulations.
 
It is NS' policy to record a liability
where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably
(see Note 17).
 
Claims, if any,
against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS, are
reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets and are not netted against the associated NS liability.
 
Environmental engineers regularly
participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any
necessary adjustments to liability estimates.
 
NS also has established an Environmental
Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its
environmental policy.

Operating
expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $16 million in
2007, $19 million in 2006 and $16 million in 2005, and capital expenditures
totaled approximately $7 million in 2007, $6 million in 2006 and $9 million
in 2005.
 
Capital expenditures in
2008 are expected to be comparable to those in 2007.

NS'
Consolidated Balance Sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in
the amount of $46 million at Dec. 31, 2007, and $54 million at Dec.
31, 2006 (of which $12 million was accounted for as a current liability at
Dec. 31, 2007 and 2006).
 
At Dec.
31, 2007, the liability represented NS' estimate of the probable cleanup and
remediation costs based on available information at 155 identified
locations.
 
On that date, 13 sites
accounted for $25 million of the liability, and no individual site was
considered to be material.
 
NS
anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years;
however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period.

At 32
locations, one or more NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of
other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability
for cleanup costs.

With respect to known environmental sites (whether
identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of
NS' ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate
for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying
costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new
cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and
full extent of contamination and each potential participant's share of any
estimated loss (and that participant's ability to bear it), and evolving statutory
and regulatory standards governing liability.
 
NS estimates its environmental
remediation liability on a site-by-site basis, using assumptions and judgments
that management deems appropriate for each site.
 
As a result, it is not practical to
quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and
judgments.
 
NS has consistently
applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities.

Based on an assessment of known facts and
circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters,
either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse
effect on NS' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Norfolk
 Southern and certain
subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating
principally to railroad operations.
 

When management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is
accrued through a charge to expenses.
 

While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits
and claims is dependent on future developments, in management's opinion the
recorded liability, if any, is adequate to cover the future payment of such
liability and claims.
 
However, the
final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with
certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional
accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular
year or quarter.
 
Any adjustments to
recorded liabilities will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such
adjustments are known.

Income
Taxes

NS'
net long-term deferred tax liability totaled $6.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2007 (see
Note 3).
 
This liability is
estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in
the financial statements.
 
After
application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is
required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the
corporate income tax
returns
..
 
For state income and other taxes,
judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various
jurisdictions.
 
A valuation
allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not
that its deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 
NS had a $10 million valuation
allowance on $685 million of deferred tax assets as of Dec. 31, 2007,
reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized.

In addition, NS has a
recorded liability for its estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return.
 

Judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state
tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to
the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will realized upon settlement
with the taxing authority.
 

Management believes this liability for uncertain tax positions to be
adequate.
 
Income tax expense is
adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes
available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded.
 
For every one half percent change in the
2007 effective rate net income would have changed by $11 million.

OTHER
MATTERS

Labor
Agreements

Approximately 26,000, or about 85%, of NS' railroad
employees are covered by labor agreements with various labor unions.
 
These agreements remain in effect until
changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act (RLA).
 
NS largely bargains in concert with
other major railroads.
 
Moratorium
provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and the unions may
propose changes.
 
The most recent
bargaining round began in late 2004.
 

Since that time, the railroads have finalized agreements that extend
through 2009 with all of the major rail unions except the United Transportation
Union (UTU) and the International Association of Machinists (IAM).
 
A tentative agreement has been reached
with the UTU that is subject to ratification by employees.

NS previously reached separate agreements
with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) and the
American Train Dispatchers Association (ATDA) through 2009.
 
Thus, only the health and welfare
provisions from the national agreements will apply to NS’ locomotive
engineers and ATDA-represented dispatchers.
 
NS recently reached a tentative
agreement with BLET that would have further extended its contract with that
union through 2014.
 
However, that
agreement was not ratified by employees.

A tentative national agreement with IAM was
not ratified by employees.
 
Negotiations
with IAM are being mediated by the National Mediation Board (NMB), a federal
agency.
 
The status quo is preserved
during mediation (that is, the union may not strike and management may not
change the labor agreements) while the NMB assists the parties in their efforts
to reach agreement.
  
If the
NMB were to terminate mediation, it would, at that time, propose that the
parties arbitrate their differences.
 

A strike could occur 30 days thereafter if the parties did not
accept arbitration.
 
However, the
President of the
United
  States of America
 could then appoint an
Emergency Board which would delay any strike for a further 60 days while the
Board made recommendations and the parties engaged in further
negotiations.
 
The outcome of the
negotiations cannot be determined at this time.

Market
Risks and Hedging Activities

NS
has used derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in
its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates.

In
2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel
consumption.
 
The intent of the
program was to assist in the management of NS' aggregate risk exposure to fuel
price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS' operating margins and
profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments.
 
No new hedges have been entered into
since May of 2004, and the last remaining contracts were settled in the second
quarter of 2006, bringing an end to the benefits from the program.
 
Locomotive diesel fuel costs represented
14% of NS' operating expenses for 2006 and 11% for 2005.

NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating-rate debt instruments and by
entering into interest-rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix
within its debt portfolio.

At Dec. 31, 2007, NS' debt subject to interest rate
fluctuations totaled $413 million.
 

A 1% point increase in interest rates would increase NS' total
annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $4 million.
 
Management considers it unlikely that
interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in
a material adverse effect on NS' financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

Some of NS' capital leases, which carry an average
fixed rate of 7%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using
interest rate swap agreements.
 
On
Dec. 31, 2007, the average pay rate under these agreements was 5%, and the
average receive rate was 7%.
 
During
2007 and 2006, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $1 million
and $1 million
,
respectively
..
 
A portion of the lease obligations is
payable in Japanese yen.
 
NS
eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease
with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen-denominated obligation.
 
Most of these deposits are held by
foreign banks, primarily Japanese.
 

As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to
Japan
..
 
Counterparties to the interest rate
swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions
believed by management to be creditworthy.

New
Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value
Measurements.
 
This statement,
effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after Nov. 15,
2007, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements.
 
NS will adopt the
statement in the first quarter of 2008 and expects it will not have a material
effect on NS’ consolidated financial statements.

FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, “Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” issued in June 2006, clarifies
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s
financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes.”
 
FIN 48
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
 
Under the guidelines of FIN 48, an
entity should recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it
determines that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained
on examination.
 
NS adopted this
Interpretation in the first quarter of 2007 (see Notes 1 and 3).

Inflation

In
preparing financial statements,
U.S.

generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost
that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of
property.
 
NS, a capital-intensive
company, has

most
of its capital invested in such assets.
 

The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related
depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported
on the basis of historical cost.

Proposed Legislation and Regulations on Safety and
Transportation of Hazardous Materials

Regulations proposed by the
Department of Homeland Security in late 2006 would mandate that railroads adopt
chain of custody and security measures.
 

If enacted, such regulations could cause service degradation and higher
costs for the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard materials.  In
addition, certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning
hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders.  Some legislators
have contemplated pre-notification requirements for hazardous material
shipments.  If promulgated, such ordinances could require the re-routing
of hazardous materials shipments, with the potential for significant additional
costs and network inefficiencies.
 
Accordingly,
NS will oppose efforts to impose unwarranted regulation in this area.

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

This
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations contains forward-loo
ki
ng
statements that may be identified by the use of words like
“believe,” “expect,” “anticipate” and
“project.” Forward-loo
ki
ng
statements reflect management's good-faith evaluation of information currently
available.
 
However, such statements
are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external
variables over which management has little or no control, including:
 
domestic and international economic
conditions; interest rates; the business environment in industries that produce
and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the
transportation industry; the operations of carriers with which NS interchanges;
acts of terrorism or war; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular
diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages;
legislative and regulatory developments; results of litigation; changes in
securities and capital markets; disruptions to NS’ technology
infrastructure, including computer systems; and natural events such as severe
weather, hurricanes and floods.
 
For
a discussion of significant risk factors applicable to NS, see Part I, Item 1A
“Risk Factors.”
 
Forward-loo
ki

upon as, a guarantee of future performance or results, nor will they
necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any
such performance or results will be achieved.
 
As a result, actual outcomes and results
may differ materially from those expressed in forward-loo

To
the Stockholders

Norfolk
 Southern Corporation

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting.
 
In order to
ensure that the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting is
effective, management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently
for its financial reporting as of Dec. 31, 2007.
 
This assessment was based on criteria
for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
 

Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the Corporation
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of Dec. 31,
2007.

KPMG
LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the
Corporation's financial statements and issued an attestation report on the
Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of Dec. 31, 2007.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Norfolk
 Southern Corporation:

We have audited Norfolk
Southern Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Norfolk Southern
Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Report of Management.
 
Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(
United States
).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
 
Our audit also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Norfolk
Southern Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control –
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Norfolk Southern
Corporation as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, and our
report dated February 15, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Norfolk
 Southern Corporation:

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Norfolk Southern Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have
audited the financial statement schedule as listed in Item 15(A)2. These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(
United States
).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Norfolk Southern Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

As discussed in note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, Norfolk Southern Corporation adopted
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,

effective
January 1, 2007, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised
2004),

Share-Based Payment,

effective
January 1, 2006, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,

effective December 31, 2006.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), Norfolk Southern Corporation’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control – Integrated Framework

, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 15,
2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

The
following Notes are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

1.
 
Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Description
of Business

Norfolk
Southern Corporation is a Virginia-based holding company engaged principally in
the rail transportation business, operating approximately 21,000 route miles
primarily in the East and
Midwest
..
 
These consolidated financial statements
include Norfolk Southern Corporation (
Norfolk

Southern) and its majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries (collectively,
NS).
 
Norfolk
 Southern's major subsidiary is
Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR).
 

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

NSR
and its railroad subsidiaries transport raw materials, intermediate products
and finished goods classified in the following market groups (percent of total
railway operating revenues in 2007): coal (25%); intermodal (20%); chemicals (13%);
metals/construction (12%); agriculture/consumer products/government (11%); automotive
(10%); and paper/clay/forest products (9%).
 
Although most of NS’ customers are
domestic, ultimate points of origination or destination for some of the
products transported (particularly coal bound for export and some intermodal
containers) may be outside the
United
  States
..
 

Approximately 85% of NS' railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining
agreements with various labor unions.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with
U.S.
 generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
 
Management periodically reviews its
estimates, including those related to the recoverability and useful lives of
assets, as well as liabilities for litigation, environmental remediation,
casualty claims, income taxes, and pension and other postretirement
benefits.
 
Changes in facts and
circumstances may result in revised estimates.

Revenue
Recognition

Transportation revenue is recognized proportionally
as a shipment moves from origin to destination and related expenses are
recognized as incurred.
 
Refunds
(which are primarily volume-based incentives) are recorded as a reduction to
revenues on the basis of management's best estimate of projected liability,
which is based on historical activity, current traffic counts and the
expectation of future activity.
 
NS
regularly monitors its contract refund liability, and historically, the
estimates have not differed significantly from the amounts ultimately
refunded.
 
Switching, demurrage and
other incidental service revenues are recognized when the services are
performed.

Derivatives

NS
does not engage in the trading of derivatives.
 
NS uses derivative financial instruments
to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and in the management
of its mix of fixed and floating-rate debt.
 
Management has determined that these
derivative instruments qualify as either fair-value or cash-flow hedges, having
values that highly correlate with the underlying hedged exposures, and has
designated such instruments as hedging

transactions.
 
Income and expense related to the
derivative financial instruments are recorded in the same category as generated
by the underlying asset or liability.
 

Credit risk related to the derivative financial instruments is
considered to be minimal and is managed by requiring high credit standards for
counterparties and periodic settlements (see Note 16).

Stock-Based
Compensation

NS
has stock-based employee compensation plans, which are more fully described in
Note 11.
 
Through Dec. 31, 2005,
NS applied the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of APB
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (APB
Opinion 25), and related interpretations in accounting for these plans
(See “Required Accounting Changes,” below).

The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if
NS had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (SFAS 123), to stock-based employee compensation:

Required Accounting Changes

Effective Jan. 1, 2007, NS adopted Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” which clarifies accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial
statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes.”
 
FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return.
 

Under the guidelines of FIN 48, an entity should recognize the financial
statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely
than not that the position will be sustained on examination (see Note 3).

Effective Dec. 31, 2006, NS
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158,
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans” (see Note 10).

Effective January 1, 2006, NS
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
“Share-Based Payment,” [SFAS 123(R)].
 
This statement applies to awards
granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled after the

effective date as well as awards
that are unvested at the effective date and includes, among other things, the requirement
to expense the fair value of stock options.
 
The standard also requires that awards
to be settled in cash be measured at fair value at each reporting date until ultimate
settlement.
 
NS adopted SFAS 123(R)
using the modified prospective method, which requires application of the
standard to all awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled on or after
January 1, 2006, and to all awards for which the requisite service has not been
rendered as of such date.
 
In
accordance with the modified prospective approach, prior period financial
statements have not been restated to reflect the impact of SFAS 123(R).
 
As compared to amounts that would have
been recognized under APB Opinion 25, the adoption of SFAS 123(R) resulted in
$27
 
million of additional compensation expense for 2006,
including the immediate expensing of 2006 grants made to retirement-eligible
employees, which reduced net income by $20 million, or 5 cents per basic and
diluted share.
 
Under SFAS 123(R), all new
awards granted to retirement eligible employees must be expensed
immediately.
 
Under APB Opinion No.
25 and related interpretations, such awards were amortized over the stated
service period.
 
Such awards were
treated similarly under SFAS 123 in the pro forma amounts disclosed in the
preceding table.

Cash
Equivalents

“Cash
equivalents” are highly liquid investments purchased three months or less
from maturity.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

NS'
allowance for doubtful accounts was $5 million at Dec. 31, 2007 and 2006.
 
To determine its allowance for doubtful
accounts, NS evaluates historical loss experience (which has not been
significant), the characteristics of current accounts, as well as general
economic conditions and trends.

Materials
and Supplies

“Materials
and supplies,” consisting mainly of fuel oil and items for maintenance of
property and equipment, are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
 
The cost of materials and supplies
expected to be used in capital additions or improvements is included in
“Properties.”

Investments

Debt securities classified as
“held-to-maturity” are reported at amortized cost and marketable
equity and debt securities classified as “trading” or “available-for-sale”
are recorded at fair value.
 

Unrealized after-tax gains and losses for investments designated as
“available-for-sale,” are recognized in “Accumulated other
comprehensive loss.”

Investments
where NS has the ability to exercise significant influence over but does not
control the entity are accounted for using the equity method in accordance with
APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock.”

Properties

“Properties”
are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using group
depreciation.
 
Rail is depreciated
primarily on the basis of use measured by gross ton-miles.
 
Other properties are depreciated
generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service
or lease lives.
 
Depletion of
natural resources (see Note 2) is based on units of production.
 
Depreciation in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows includes depreciation and depletion.
 
NS capitalizes interest on major capital
projects during the period of their construction.
 
Expenditures, including those on leased
assets that extend an asset's useful life or increase its utility, are
capitalized.
 
Costs related to
repairs and maintenance activities that do not extend an asset’s useful
life or increase its utility are expensed when such repairs are performed.
 
When properties other than land and
nonrail assets are

sold
or retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost of the assets, net of
sale proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain
or loss is recognized through income.
 

Gains and losses on disposal of land and nonrail assets are included in
“Other income - net” (see Note 2) since such income is not a
product of NS’ railroad operations.

NS
reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable
based on future undiscounted cash flows.
 

Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded
at the lower of carrying amount or fair value.

Reclassifications

Certain
comparative prior year amounts presented in “Railway operating
expenses” have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.
 
Amounts previously
presented as “Diesel fuel” (used in locomotives) have been combined
with other fuel and related costs and are now presented as
“Fuel.”
 
Additionally,
certain other groupings of costs within “Railway operating
expenses” have been changed.

NS has a 40.5% interest in a limited
liability company that owned and operated facilities that produced synthetic
fuel from coal.
 
In addition, in
2007 NS purchased two facilities that produced synthetic fuel from coal.
 
The production of synthetic fuel resulted
in tax credits as well as expenses related to the investments.
 
The expenses are included in “Expenses
related to synthetic fuel investments” above.

“Other
current assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes prepaid
interest of $58 million at Dec. 31, 2007, and $50 million at Dec. 31,

In August 2007,
Illinois
 enacted tax
legislation that modifies the way in which transportation companies apportion
their taxable income to the state.
 

The change resulted in an increase in NS’ deferred income tax
liability in the third quarter, as required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which
increased deferred tax expense by $19 million.

In
June 2005,
Ohio

enacted tax legislation that phases out its Corporate Franchise Tax, which was
generally based on federal taxable income, and phases in a new gross receipts
tax called the Commercial Activity Tax, which is based on current year sales
and rentals.
 
The phased elimination
of the Corporate Franchise Tax resulted in a reduction in NS’ deferred
income tax liability, as required by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which, as
noted above, decreased deferred tax expense by $96 million.

Deferred
Tax Assets and Liabilities

Certain
items are reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax
purposes.
 
Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recorded in recognition of these differences.
 
The tax effects of temporary differences
that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred
tax liabilities are as follows:

(6,444)

Except
for amounts for which a valuation allowance has been provided, management
believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations
will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax
assets.
 
The valuation allowance at
the end of each year relates to subsidiary state income tax net operating
losses that may not be utilized prior to their expiration.
 
The total valuation allowance increased
$1 million in 2007, and decreased $1 million in 2006 and $3 million
in 2005.

Uncertain Tax Positions

As a result of the
implementation of FIN 48 on Jan. 1, 2007 (see Note 1), NS recognized a $10
million increase to stockholders’ equity, $2 million of which related to
investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
 
A reconciliation of the beginning and
ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows ($ in millions):

Balance
  at December 31, 2007

$


Included in the balance of
unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2007, are potential benefits of $56 million
that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.
 
Unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted in
the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or
the final outcome differs from the amount recorded.

NS expects that the total
amount of unrecognized tax benefits at Dec. 31, 2007, will decrease by between
$30 million and $35 million in 2008 due to tax positions for which
there was an uncertainty about the timing of deductibility in earlier years but
deductibility may become certain by the close of 2008.
 
NS’ consolidated federal income
tax returns for 2004 and 2005 are being audited by the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS).
 
NS anticipates that the IRS
will complete its examination of the 2004 and 2005 years within the next twelve
months.
 
It is reasonably possible
that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change due to the completion
of the IRS examination of the 2004 and 2005 years, but an estimate of the
change cannot be made.
 
The IRS
completed its examination of the 2002 and 2003 consolidated federal income tax
returns during the third quarter of 2006 and NS appealed certain adjustments
proposed by the IRS.
 
State income
tax returns generally are subject to examination for a period of three to four
years after filing of the return.
 

In addition, NS is generally obligated to report changes in taxable
income arising from federal income tax examinations to the states within a
period of up to two years from the date the federal examination is final.
 
NS has various state income tax returns
either under examination, administrative appeals, or litigation.
 
It is reasonably possible that the
amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in 2008 as a result of the
lapse of state statutes of limitations, but the amount is not expected to be
significant.
 
NS does not expect
that any of the above potential changes in unrecognized tax benefits will have
a material effect on NS’ financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

Interest related to
unrecognized tax benefits, which is included in “Other income – net,”
amounted to $12 million of expense in 2007 and income of $2 million in
2006 and $12 million in 2005.
 
Penalties
related to tax matters are included in “Provision for income taxes”
and totaled zero in each of 2007, 2006 and 2005.
 
NS has recorded a liability of $28
million at Dec. 31, 2007, and $17 million at Jan. 1, 2007, for the payment of
interest on unrecognized tax benefits.
 

NS has no liability recorded at Dec. 31, 2007, and Jan. 1, 2007, for the
payment of penalties on unrecognized tax benefits.

LLC, a joint venture formed with
Kansas
  City
 Southern in 2006.

Investment
in Conrail

Through a limited liability company,
Norfolk
 Southern and CSX Corporation (CSX)
jointly own Conrail Inc. (Conrail), whose primary subsidiary is Consolidated
Rail Corporation (CRC).
 
NS has a
58% economic and 50% voting interest in the jointly owned entity, and CSX has
the remainder of the economic and voting interests.
 
NS is applying the equity method of
accounting to its remaining investment in Conrail in accordance with APB
Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock.”
 
NS is
amortizing the excess of the purchase price over Conrail’s net equity
using the principles of purchase accounting, based primarily on the estimated
useful lives of Conrail’s depreciable property and equipment, including
the related deferred tax effect of the differences in tax accounting bases for
such assets, as all of the purchase price at acquisition was allocable to
Conrail’s tangible assets and liabilities.
 
At Dec. 31, 2007, the difference between
NS’ investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail’s underlying net
equity was $555 million.

CRC
owns and operates certain properties (the Shared Assets Areas) for the joint
and exclusive benefit of NSR and CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT).
 
The costs of operating the Shared Assets
Areas are borne by NSR and CSXT based on usage.
 
In addition, NSR and CSXT pay CRC a fee
for access to the Shared Assets Areas.
 

"Purchased services and rents" includes expenses for amounts
due to CRC for operation of the Shared Assets Areas of $126 million in 2007 and
2006, and $129 million in 2005.
 

Future
minimum lease payments due to CRC under the Shared Assets Areas agreements are
as follows: $28 million in each of 2008 through 2012 and $317 million
thereafter.
 
NS provides certain
general and administrative support functions to Conrail, the fees for which are
billed in accordance with several service-provider arrangements and amount to
approximately $7 million annually.

“Accounts payable” includes $78 million
at Dec. 31, 2007, and $68 million at Dec. 31, 2006, due to Conrail for the
operation of the Shared Assets Areas.
 

In addition, “Other liabilities” includes $133 million at
Dec. 31, 2007 and 2006 for long-term advances from Conrail, maturing 2035,
entered into in 2005 that bear interest at an average
rate of 4.4%.

In
November 2007, NS entered into a $500 million receivables securitization
facility under which NSR sells substantially all of its eligible third-party
receivables to an NS subsidiary, which in turn may transfer beneficial
interests in the receivables to various commercial paper vehicles.
 
Amounts received under the facility are
accounted for as borrowings.
 
The
facility has a 364-day term; however, NS intends to refinance these borrowings
by issuing long-term debt, which is supported by its $1 billion credit
agreement (see below).
 
Accordingly,
amounts outstanding are included in the line item “Long-term debt”
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
 

At Dec. 31, 2007, the amount of receivables included in
“Accounts receivable – net” serving as collateral for these
borrowings was $778 million.

In
May 2005, NS issued $717 million of unsecured notes ($350 million at 5.64% due
2029 and $367 million at 5.59% due 2025) and paid $218 million of premium
in exchange for $717 million of its previously issued unsecured notes ($350
million at 7.8% due 2027, $200 million at 7.25% due 2031, and $167 million at
9.0% due 2021).
 
The $218 million
cash premium payment is reflected as a reduction of debt in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet and Statement of Cash Flows and is included in “Discounts
and premiums, net.”
 
The
premium is being amortized as additional interest expense over the terms of the
new debt, resulting in effective interest rates of 8.7% for the 2029 notes and
9.0% for the 2025 notes.

“Discounts and premiums, net” at Dec.
31, 2007 and 2006, includes $126 million and $130 million,
respectively, related to $314 million face amount of 9.75% notes due in
2020 and $138 million face amount of 7.875% notes due 2043, which is being
amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the terms of the notes,
resulting in effective interest rates of 6.0% and 6.2%, respectively.

The
railroad equipment obligations and the capitalized leases are secured by liens
on the underlying equipment.
 

Certain lease obligations require the maintenance of yen-denominated
deposits, which are pledged to the lessor to satisfy yen-denominated lease
payments.
 
These deposits are included
in “Other assets” on the balance sheet and totaled $80 million
at Dec. 31, 2007, and $85 million at Dec. 31, 2006.

Shelf
Registration

NS has
on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission two Form S-3 shelf
registration statements, under which up to $700 million of additional debt
or equity securities could be issued.

Credit
Agreement, Debt Covenants and Commercial Paper

NS has
in place a five-year $1 billion credit facility expiring in 2012.
 
Any borrowings under the credit
agreement are contingent on the continuing effectiveness of certain representations
and warranties made at the inception of the agreement.
 
NS is subject to various financial
covenants with respect to its debt and under its credit agreement, including a
maximum leverage ratio restriction, certain restrictions on the issuance of
further debt by NS or its subsidiaries and the consolidation, merger or sale of
substantially all of NS’ assets.
 

At Dec. 31, 2007, NS was in compliance with all financial covenants.

NS
has the ability to issue commercial paper
support
ed
by its $1 billion credit agreement.
 

At Dec. 31, 2007, and Dec. 31, 2006, NS had no outstanding commercial
paper or borrowings under the credit agreement.

Lease Commitments

NS is committed under long-term lease agree­ments,
which expire on various dates through 2067, for equipment, lines of road and
other property.

Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits

Norfolk
 Southern and certain subsidiaries have both funded
and unfunded defined benefit pension plans covering principally salaried
employees.
 
Norfolk
 Southern and certain subsidiaries
also provide specified health care and death benefits to eligible retired
employees and their dependents.
 

Under the present plans, which may be amended or terminated at NS'
option, a defined percentage of health care expenses is covered, reduced by any
deductibles, co-payments, Medicare payments and, in some cases, coverage
provided under other group insurance policies.

Required Accounting Change

As of Dec. 31, 2006, NS
adopted SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” (SFAS 158).
 
This statement requires an employer to
recognize in its statement of financial position the overfunded or underfunded
status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans measured as the
difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit
obligation.
 
Employers must also
recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the
actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs, credits and transition
costs that arise during the period.
 
As a result of adopting this standard, NS
reduced its pension asset by $217 million and increased its pension and
postretirement liabilities by $258 million in its Consolidated Balance
Sheet, with a corresponding reduction to stockholders’ equity of $292 million
(net of tax) reflected as an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss.
 
In addition, NS recognized a $2 million
reduction to stockholders’ equity related to its proportionate share of
Conrail’s adoption of SFAS 158.
 

The adoption of SFAS 158 has no impact on years prior to 2006 and has no
effect on the calculation of expenses for pensions and post-retirement
benefits.

Pension
Assumptions

Pension and other postretirement benefit costs are
determined based on actuarial valuations that reflect appropriate assumptions
as of the measurement date, ordinarily the beginning of each year.
 
The funded status of the plans is
determined using appropriate assumptions as of each year end.
 
A summary of the major assumptions
follows:

To
determine the discount rate in 2007, NS utilized an analysis in which the
projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans
were matched with a yield curve based on an appropriate universe of
high-quality corporate bonds.
 
NS
used the results of the yield curve to select the discount rate that matches
the payment stream of the benefits in these plans.
 
Previously, NS referred to Moody’s
seasoned Aa corporate bond yields and the changes in such yields in establishing
the discount rate.

Health
Care Cost Trend Assumptions

For
measurement purposes at Dec. 31, 2007, increases in the per capita cost of
covered health care benefits were assumed to be 9% for 2007 and 8.5% for 2008.
 
It is assumed the rate will decrease
gradually to an ultimate rate of 5% for 2012 and remain at that level
thereafter.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements.
 
To illustrate, a one-percentage-point
change in the assumed health care cost trend would have the following effects:

Asset Management

Eleven
investment firms manage NS’ defined benefit pension plan’s assets
under investment guidelines approved by the Board of Directors.
 
Investments are restricted to domestic
fixed income securities, international fixed income securities, domestic and
international equity investments and unleveraged exchange-traded options and
financial futures.
 
Limitations
restrict investment concentration and use of certain derivative
instruments.
 
The target asset
allocation for equity is 75% of the pension plan’s assets.
 
Fixed income investments must have an
average rating of “AA” or better and all fixed income securities
must be rated “A” or better except bond index funds.
 
Equity investments must be in liquid
securities listed on national exchanges.
 

No investment is permitted in the securities of Norfolk Southern
Corporation or its subsidiaries (except through commingled pension trust
funds).
 
Investment managers’
returns
 are expected to meet or exceed selected
market indices by prescribed margins.

NS’
pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at Dec. 31, 2007 and 2006, by
asset category, were as follows:

The
postretirement benefit plan assets consist primarily of trust-owned variable
life insurance policies with an asset allocation at Dec. 31, 2007, of 65% in
equity securities and 35% in debt securities compared with 67% in equity
securities and 33% in debt securities at Dec. 31, 2006.
 
The target asset allocation for equity
is between 50% and 75% of the plan’s assets.

The plans’ assumed
future
returns
 are based principally
on the asset allocation and on the historic
returns

for the plans’ asset classes determined from both actual plan
returns
 and, over longer time periods, market
returns
 for those asset classes.

Contributions and Estimated Future Benefit Payments

In 2008, NS expects to
contribute approximately $9 million to its unfunded pension plans for payments
to pensioners and $48 million to its other postretirement benefit plans for
retiree health benefits.

Benefit payments, which
reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid
as follows:

The
other postretirement benefit payments include an estimated annual reduction due
to the Medicare Part D Subsidy of about $6 million.

Other Postretirement Coverage

Under collective bargaining
agreements, NS and certain subsidiaries participate in a multi-employer benefit
plan, which provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance
benefits to eligible union employees.
 

Premiums under this plan are expensed as incurred and amounted to $27 million
in 2007 and $26 million in 2006 and 2005.

Section
401(k) Plans

Norfolk
 Southern and certain
subsidiaries provide Section 401(k) savings plans for employees.
 
Under the plans, NS matches a portion of
employee contributions, subject to applicable limitations.
 
NS' expenses under these plans were $14 million
in 2007 and 2006, and $13 million in 2005.

11.
 
Stock-Based Compensation

Under
the stockholder-approved Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), a committee of
nonemployee directors of the Board or the chief executive officer (if delegated
such authority by the committee) may grant stock options, stock appreciation
rights (SARs), restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance shares
and performance share units (PSUs), up to a maximum of 88,025,000 shares of
Norfolk Southern Common Stock (Common Stock).
 
Of these shares, 5,000,000 were approved
by the Board for issuance to non-officer participants; as a broad-based
issuance, stockholder approval was not required.
 
In May 2005, the stockholders approved
an amended LTIP which provided that 8,500,000 shares of stock previously
approved for issuance under LTIP could be granted as restricted shares,
restricted stock unit shares or performance shares.
 
Under the Board-approved Thoroughbred
Stock Option Plan (TSOP), the committee may grant stock options up to a maximum
of 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock; as a broad-based stock option plan,
stockholder approval of TSOP was not required.
 
NS uses newly issued shares to satisfy
any exercises and awards under LTIP and TSOP.

The
LTIP also permits the payment – on a current or a deferred basis and in cash
or in stock – of dividend equivalents on shares of Common Stock covered
by options, PSUs or restricted stock units in an amount commensurate with
dividends paid on Common Stock.
 
Tax
absorption payments also are authorized for any awards under LTIP in amounts
estimated to equal the federal and state income taxes applicable to shares of
Common Stock issued subject to a share retention agreement.

During the first quarter of 2007, a committee of
nonemployee directors of NS’ Board granted stock options, restricted
stock units and PSUs pursuant to the LTIP and granted stock options pursuant to
the TSOP.
 
Receipt of an award under
LTIP was made contingent upon the awardee’s execution of a non-compete
agreement, and all awards under LTIP were made subject to forfeiture in the
event the awardee “engages in competing employment” for a period of
time following retirement.

Accounting
Method

As disclosed in Note 1, prior to the adoption of
SFAS 123(R), NS applied APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in accounting
for awards made under the plans.
 

Accordingly, grants of PSUs, restricted shares, restricted share units,
dividend equivalents, tax absorption payments and SARs resulted in charges to
net income, while grants of stock options had no effect on net income.
 
Under SFAS 123(R), all awards will
result in charges to net income while dividend equivalents are charged to retained
earnings.
 
Related compensation
costs were $96 million in 2007, $129 million in 2006 and $75 million
in 2005.
 
The total tax effect
recognized in income in relation to stock-based compensation was a benefit of $32 million
in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $27 million in 2005.

Stock Options

Options
may be granted for a term not to exceed 10 years and are subject to a vesting
period of at least one year.
 
Option
exercise prices are at not less than the fair market value of Common Stock on
the effective date of the grant.
 
In the first quarter of 2007,
1,203,300 options were granted under the LTIP and 251,000 options were granted
under the TSOP.
 
In each case, the
grant price was $49.555, which was the fair market value of Common Stock on the
date of grant, and the options have a term of ten years but may not be
exercised prior to the third

anniversary
of the date of grant.
 
Holders of the
options granted under LTIP who remain employed by NS receive cash dividend
equivalent payments for five years commensurate with dividends paid on Common
Stock.

In the first quarter of 2006, 1,188,700 options were
granted under the LTIP and 238,000 options were granted under the TSOP.
 
In each case, the grant price was
$49.425, which was the fair market value of Common Stock on the date of grant,
and the options have a term of ten years but may not be exercised prior to the
first anniversary of the date of grant.

The fair value of each option award in 2007 and 2006
was measured on the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation
model.
 
Expected volatilities are
based on implied volatilities from traded options on Common Stock and
historical volatility of Common Stock.
 

NS uses historical data to estimate option exercises and employee
terminations within the valuation model.
 

The average expected option life is derived from the output of the
valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are
expected to be outstanding.
 
The
average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
effect at the time of grant.
 
For
options granted that include dividend equivalent payments, a dividend yield of
zero was used.
 
For purposes of pro
forma information required under SFAS 123, the fair value of the option awards
in 2005 was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
 
The assumptions for 2007, 2006 and 2005 are
shown in the following table:

The grant date fair value of the 2007 TSOP grant was

yield of 1.5% was used because no dividend equivalents are paid on these
options and the average expected option term was 6.5 years.

Prior
to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), NS presented tax benefits generated from tax
deductions in excess of compensation costs recognized for share-based awards
(excess tax benefits) as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows.
 
Beginning in 2006, SFAS
123(R) requires excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash
flows.
 
Accordingly, “Common
stock issued – net” in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
for the years ended Dec. 31, 2007 and 2006, included $57 million and
$85 million of such tax benefits, respectively.

In
November of 2005, the Board of Directors of NS changed the vesting periods on
options granted in January 2005 from three years to one year in order to reduce
future compensation expense.
 
At the
time, each of these options had an intrinsic value of approximately $9 and the
modification resulted in less than $1 million of compensation expense.

Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units

Restricted share and
restricted stock unit grants were zero and 321,450, respectively, in 2007, with
a grant-date fair value of $50.01 and a 5-year restriction period, and were 332,150
and 332,150, respectively, in 2006, with a grant-date fair value of $49.60 and
a three-year restriction period, and were 576,240 and 384,160, respectively, in
2005, with a grant-date fair value of $34.10 and a five-year restriction
period.
 
Restricted stock units
granted in 2007 will be settled through issuance of shares of Common
Stock.
 
The restricted stock unit
grants include cash dividend equivalent payments during the restriction period
commensurate with dividends paid on Common Stock.

That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
approximately 2.1 years.
 
The
total fair value of the restricted shares vested and restricted stock units
paid in cash during the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $22 million,
$40 million and $2

The total related tax benefit realized was $3 million in 2007 and
$6 million in 2006.

Performance Share Units

PSUs provide for awards based
on achievement of certain predetermined corporate performance goals (total
shareholder return, return on average invested capital and operating ratio) at
the end of a three-year cycle.
 
PSU

grants and average grant-date

One-half
of any PSUs earned will be paid in the form of shares of Common Stock with the
other half to be paid in cash.

Stock Purchase Program

In March 2007, NS’ Board of Directors amended
NS’ share repurchase program and increased the authorized amount of share
repurchases from 50 million to 75 million shares and shortened the
authorized period from 2015 to 2010.
 

The timing and volume of purchases is guided by management’s
assessment of market conditions and other pertinent facts.
 
Near-term purchases under the program
are expected to be made with internally generated cash; however, future funding
sources could include proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes or the
increase of long-term debt.
 
NS
purchased and retired 23.6 million shares and 21.7 million shares of its
common stock under this program in 2007 and 2006, respectively, at a cost of $1.2 billion
and $964 million, respectively.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The
fair values of “Cash and cash equivalents,” “Short-term
investments,” “Accounts receivable” and “Accounts
payable” approximate carrying values because of the short maturity of
these financial instruments.
 
The fair
value of corporate-owned life insurance approximates carrying value.
 
The carrying amounts and estimated fair
values for the remaining financial instruments, excluding derivatives and investments
accounted for under the equity method in accordance with APB Opinion
No. 18, consisted of the following at Dec. 31:

The fair values of debt were estimated
based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flows using current interest
rates for debt with similar terms, company rating and remaining maturity.

Carrying amounts of marketable securities reflect
unrealized holding gains of zero on Dec. 31, 2007, and $1 million on Dec. 31,
2006.
 
Sales of
“available-for-sale” securities were immaterial for the years ended
Dec. 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005; most short-term investments were redeemed at
maturity.

16.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments

All
derivatives are recognized in the financial statements as either assets or
liabilities and are measured at fair value.
 
Changes in fair value are recorded as
adjustments to the assets or liabilities being hedged in “Other
comprehensive loss,” or in current earnings, depending on whether the
derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting, the type of hedge
transaction represented and the effectiveness of the hedge.

NS has used derivative
financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs
and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
 
NS does not engage in the trading of
derivatives.
 
Management has
determined that its derivative financial instruments qualify as either
fair-value or cash-flow hedges, having values that highly correlate with the
underlying hedged exposures, and has designated such instruments as hedging
transactions.
 
Credit risk related
to the derivative financial instruments is considered to be minimal and is
managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic
settlements.

Diesel Fuel Hedging

From 2001 until May 2004, NS entered into contracts
that hedged a portion of its diesel fuel consumption.
 
The intent of the program was to assist
in the management of NS' aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations,
which can significantly affect NS' operating margins and profitability, through
the use of one or more types of derivative instruments.
 
The
goal of this hedging strategy was to reduce the variability of fuel costs over
an extended period of time while minimizing the incremental cost of hedging.
The program provided that NS would not enter into any fuel hedges with a
duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS' average
monthly fuel consumption would be hedged for any month within any 36-month period.
 
After ta
ki
ng
into account the effect of the hedging, diesel fuel costs represented 14% and 11%
of NS’ operating expenses for the years ended Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.
 
The last remaining
contracts were settled in the second quarter of 2006, bringing an end to this
program.
 
NS' fuel hedging activity
resulted in decreases in diesel fuel expenses

of $20 million in 2006 and $148 million in
2005.
 
Ineffectiveness, or the
extent to which changes in the fair value of the heating oil contracts do not
offset changes in the fair values of the expected diesel fuel transactions, was
a $1 million expense in 2006 and a $5 million expense in 2005.

Interest
Rate Hedging

NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating-rate debt instruments, and by
entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix
within its debt portfolio.
 
NS had $59
million and $83 million, or about 1%, of its fixed rate debt portfolio hedged
as of Dec. 31, 2007, and Dec. 31, 2006, respectively, using interest
rate swaps that qualify for and are designated as fair-value hedge
transactions.
 
NS’ interest
rate hedging activity resulted in decreases in interest expenses of $1 million
for 2007 and 2006, and $2 million for 2005.
 
These swaps have been effective in
hedging the changes in fair value of the related debt arising from changes in
interest rates and there has been no impact on earnings resulting from
ineffectiveness associated with these derivative transactions.

Fair
Values

Fair
values of interest rate swaps at Dec. 31, 2007, and Dec. 31, 2006, were
determined based upon the present value of expected future cash flows
discounted at the appropriate implied spot rate from the spot rate yield
curve.
 
Fair value adjustments are
noncash transactions and, accordingly, are excluded from the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.
 
The total
net asset position of NS’ outstanding derivative financial instruments
was comprised of a gross fair value asset position of $1 million at both
Dec. 31, 2007, and Dec. 31, 2006.

Commitments and Contingencies

Lawsuits

Norfolk
 Southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in
numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad
operations.
 
When management
concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to
earnings.
 
While the ultimate amount
of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on
future developments, in management's opinion, the recorded liability is
adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims.
 
However, the final outcome of any of
these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable
or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be
significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.
 
Any adjustments to the recorded
liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such
adjustments are known.

Casualty Claims

Casualty claims include
employee personal injury and occupational claims as well as third-party claims,
all exclusive of legal costs.
 
To
aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to
accrue during the year, NS’ management utilizes studies prepared by an
independent consulting actuarial firm.
 

Job-related accidental injury and occupational claims are subject to the
Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to
railroads.
 
FELA’s fault-based
system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared
with a no-fault workers’ compensation system.
 
The variability inherent in this system
could result in actual costs being very different from the liability
recorded.
 
While the ultimate amount
of claims incurred is dependent on future developments, in management’s
opinion, the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payments of
claims and is
support
ed by the most
recent actuarial study.
 
In all
cases, NS records a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both
probable and estimable.

In 2005, NS recorded a
liability related to the
Jan.
 6, 2005
 derailment in
Graniteville
,

SC.
 
The liability, which includes a current
and long-term portion, represents NS’ best estimate based on
current facts and circumstances.
 

The estimate includes amounts related to business property damage and
other economic losses, personal injury and individual property damage
claims as well as third-party response costs.
 
NS’ commercial insurance policies
are expected to cover substantially all expenses related to this derailment
above NS’ self-insured retention, including NS’ response costs and
legal fees.
 
Accordingly, the
Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect a current and long-term receivable for
estimated recoveries from NS’ insurance carriers.
 
While it is reasonable to expect that
the liability for covered losses could differ from the amount recorded, such a
change would be offset by a corresponding change in the insurance
receivable.
 
As a result, NS does
not believe that it is reasonably likely that its net loss (the difference
between the liability and future recoveries) will be materially different than
the loss recorded in 2005.
 
NS
expects at this time that insurance coverage is adequate to cover potential
claims and settlements above its self-insurance retention.
 
Expenses in 2005 included
$41 million related to this incident, representing NS’ retention
under its insurance policies and other uninsured costs.

Employee personal injury claims

– The largest component of casualties and other
claims expense is employee personal injury costs.
 
The actuarial firm engaged by NS
provides quarterly studies to aid in valuing its employee personal injury
liability and estimating its employee personal injury expense.
 
The actuarial firm studies NS’
historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, ta
ki
ng into account relevant outside influences.
 
The actuary uses the results of these
analyses to estimate the ultimate amount of the liability, which includes
amounts for incurred but unasserted claims.
 
NS adjusts its liability quarterly based
upon management’s assessment and the results of the study.
 
The estimate of loss liabilities is
subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events
such as jury decisions, court interpretations or legislative changes and as
such the actual loss may vary from the amount recorded.

Occupational claims

– Occupational claims (including asbestosis and
other respiratory diseases, as well as repetitive motion) are often not caused
by a specific accident or event but rather result from a claimed exposure over
time.
 
Many such claims are being
asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been
employed in the rail industry for decades.
 

The actuarial firm provides an estimate of the occupational claims
liability based upon NS’ history of claim filings, severity, payments and
other pertinent facts.
 
The
liability is dependent upon management’s judgments made as to the
specific case reserves as well as judgments of the consulting actuarial
firm in the periodic studies.
 
The
actuarial firm’s estimate of ultimate loss includes a provision for those
claims that have been incurred but not reported.
 
This provision is derived by analyzing
industry data and projecting NS’ experience into the future as far as can
be reasonably determined.
 
NS adjusts
its liability quarterly based upon management’s assessment and the
results of the study.
 
However, it
is possible that the recorded liability may not be adequate to cover the future
payment of claims.
 
Adjustments
to the recorded liability are reflected in operating expenses in the
periods in which such adjustments become known.

Third-party claims

– NS records a liability for third-party claims
including those for highway crossing accidents, trespasser and other injuries,
automobile liability, property damage and lading damage.
 
The actuarial firm assists with the
calculation of potential liability for third-party claims, except lading
damage, based upon NS’ experience including number and timing of
incidents, amount of payments, settlement rates, number of open claims and
legal defenses.
 
The actuarial
estimate includes a provision for claims that have been incurred but have not
yet been reported.
 
Each quarter NS
adjusts its liability based upon management’s assessment and the results
of the study.
 
Given the inherent
uncertainty in regard to the ultimate outcome of third-party claims, it is
possible that future settlement costs may differ from the estimated liability
recorded.

Environmental Matters

NS
is subject to various jurisdictions' environmental laws and regulations.
 
It is NS' policy to record a liability
where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated
reasonably.
 
Claims, if any, against

third
parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as
receivables (when collection is probable) on the balance sheet and are not
netted against the associated NS liability.
 
Environmental engineers regularly
participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any
necessary adjustments to liability estimates.
 
NS also has an Environmental Policy
Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its
environmental policy.

NS'
Consolidated Balance Sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in
the amount of $46 million at Dec. 31, 2007, and $54 million at Dec.
31, 2006 (of which $12 million was accounted for as a current liability at
Dec. 31, 2007 and 2006).
 
At
Dec. 31, 2007, the liability represented NS' estimate of the probable
cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 155 known
locations compared with 172 locations at Dec. 31, 2006.
 
On that date, 13 sites accounted for $25
million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be
material.
 
NS anticipates that much
of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be
paid out over a longer period.

At 32 locations, one or more NS subsidiaries,
usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as
potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or
similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which
often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs.

With respect to known environmental sites (whether
identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of
NS' ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate
for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying
costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of
new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature
and full extent of contamination and each potential participant's share of any
estimated loss (and that participant's ability to bear it), and evolving
statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.

The risk of incurring environmental liability
– for acts and omissions, past, present and future - is inherent in the
railroad business.
 
Some of the
commodities in NS' traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous
materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently
to minimize.
 
In addition, several
NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which
is leased and operated by others, or held for sale.
 
Because environmental problems may exist
on these properties that are latent or undisclosed, there can be no assurance
that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one
or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated
reliably at this time.
 
Moreover,
lawsuits and claims involving these and potentially other unidentified
environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time.
 
The resulting liabilities could have a
significant effect on financial position, results of operations or liquidity in
a particular year or quarter.

However, based on its assessment of the facts and
circumstances now known, management believes that it has recorded the
probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which NS is
aware.
 
Further, management believes
that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the
aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS' financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

Insurance

NS obtains on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries
insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party
property damages.
 
NS is currently self-insured
up to $25 million and above $1 billion per occurrence for bodily injury and
property damage to third parties and up to $25 million and above $175 million
per occurrence for property owned by NS or in NS’ care, custody or
control.

Purchase
Commitments

At Dec. 31, 2007, NSR had outstanding purchase
commitments of approximately $298 million primarily for coal hoppers,
locomotives, RoadRailer® trailers, and track material in connection with
its capital programs through 2009.

Change-In-Control
Arrangements

Norfolk
 Southern has compensation agreements with
officers and certain key employees that become operative only upon a change in
control of
Norfolk

Southern, as defined in those agreements.
 

The agreements provide generally for payments based on compensation at
the time of a covered individual's involuntary or other specified termination
and for certain other benefits.

Guarantees

In
a number of instances, NS and its subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify lenders
for additional costs they may bear as a result of certain changes in laws or
regulations applicable to their loans.
 

Such changes may include impositions or modifications with respect to
taxes, duties, reserves, liquidity, capital adequacy, special deposits, and
similar requirements relating to extensions of credit by, deposits with, or the
assets or liabilities of such lenders.
 

The nature and timing of changes in laws or regulations applicable to
NS' financings are inherently unpredictable, and therefore NS' exposure in
connection with the foregoing indemnifications cannot be quantified.
 
No liability has been recorded related
to these indemnifications.
 
In the
case of one type of equipment financing, NSR's Japanese leveraged leases, NSR
may terminate the leases and ancillary agreements if such a change-in-law
indemnity is triggered.
 
Such a
termination would require NSR to make early termination payments that would not
be expected to have a material adverse effect on NS' financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

NS
has indemnified parties in a number of transactions for
U.S.
 income tax withholding imposed as a result
of changes in
U.S.

tax law.
 
In all cases, NS has the
right to unwind the related transaction if the withholding cannot be avoided in
the future.
 
Because these
indemnities would be triggered and are dependent upon a change in the tax law,
the maximum exposure is not quantifiable.
 

Management does not believe that it is likely that it will be required
to make any payments under these indemnities.

As
of Dec. 31, 2007, certain
Norfolk

Southern subsidiaries are contingently liable as guarantors with respect to $8 million
of indebtedness of an entity in which they have an ownership interest, the
Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis, due in 2019.
 
Four other railroads are also jointly
and severally liable as guarantors for this indebtedness.
 
No liability has been recorded related
to this guaranty.

Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

Norfolk
Southern’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the
assistance of management, evaluated the effectiveness of NS' disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a‑15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”)) as of Dec. 31, 2007.
 
Based on such evaluation, such officers
have concluded that, as of Dec. 31, 2007, NS' disclosure controls and
procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in NS’ reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

The management of
Norfolk
 Southern is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting.
 
Norfolk
Southern’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that pertain to its ability to record, process,
summarize and report reliable financial data.
 
Management recognizes that there are
inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the
circumvention or overriding of internal control.
 
Accordingly, even effective internal
control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation.
 
Further, because of changes in
conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may
vary over time.

In order to ensure that
Norfolk
 Southern’s
internal control over financial reporting is effective, management regularly
assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as
of Dec. 31, 2007.
 
This assessment
was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial
reporting set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

.
 

Based on our assessment, management has concluded that
Norfolk
 Southern maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of Dec. 31, 2007.

The Board of Directors,
acting through its Audit Committee, is responsible for the oversight of
Norfolk

financial reporting, and Norfolk Southern’s independent registered public
accounting firm has issued an attestation report on Norfolk Southern’s
internal controls over financial reporting as of Dec. 31, 2007.

Norfolk

Southern Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan
(“LTIP”)

Established on June 28, 1983,
and approved by stockholders at their Annual Meeting held on May 10, 1984, LTIP
was adopted to promote the success of
Norfolk

Southern by providing an opportunity for non-employee directors, officers and
other key employees to acquire a proprietary interest in the Corporation.
 
On Jan. 23, 2001, the Board of Directors
further amended LTIP and approved the issuance of an additional 5,000,000
shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock under LTIP to participants who
are not officers of
Norfolk

Southern.  The issuance of these shares was broadly-based, and stockholder
approval of these shares was not required.  Accordingly, this portion of
LTIP is included in the number of securities available for future issuance for
plans not approved by stockholders.  Also on Jan. 23, 2001, the Board
amended LTIP, which amendment was approved by shareholders on May 10, 2001,
that included the reservation for issuance of an additional 30,000,000 shares
of authorized but unissued Norfolk Southern Common Stock.

Pursuant to another amendment
approved by stockholders on May 12, 2005, not more than 8,500,000 of the shares
remaining available for issuance under LTIP may be awarded as restricted
shares, performance shares or restricted stock unit shares.
 
Cash payments of restricted stock units,
stock appreciation rights and performance share units will not be applied
against the maximum number of shares issuable under LTIP.
 
Any shares of

Common Stock subject to
options, performance share units or restricted stock units which are not issued
as Common Stock will again be available for award under LTIP after the
expiration or forfeiture of an award.

Non-employee
directors, officers and other key employees residing in the
United States
 or
Canada
 are eligible for selection
to receive LTIP awards.
 
Under LTIP,
the Compensation Committee (Committee) may grant incentive stock options,
nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares,
restricted stock units and performance share units.
 
In addition, dividend equivalents may be
awarded for options, restricted stock units and performance share units. The
Committee may make awards under LTIP subject to forfeiture under certain
circumstances and may establish such other terms and conditions for the awards
as provided in LTIP.

For options, the option price
per share will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of
Norfolk
 Southern's Common
Stock on the effective date the option is granted.  All options are
subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and the term of the option
will not exceed ten years.  LTIP specifically prohibits option repricing
without stockholder approval, except for capital adjustments.

Performance share units
entitle a recipient to receive performance-based compensation at the end of a
three-year performance cycle based on
Norfolk

Southern’s performance during that three-year period.  For the 2007
performance share unit awards, corporate performance will be measured using
three equally weighted standards established by the Committee: (1) three-year
average return on average capital invested, (2) three-year average operating
ratio and (3) three-year total return to stockholders as compared with the
average total return on all stocks comprising the S&P 500 composite stock
price index.  Performance share units may be payable in either shares of
Norfolk Southern Common Stock or cash.

Restricted
stock units are payable in cash or in shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock
at the end of a restriction period of not less than 36 months and not more than
60 months.
 
During the restriction
period, the holder of the restricted stock units has no beneficial ownership
interest in the Norfolk Southern Common Stock represented by the restricted
stock units and has no right to vote the shares represented by the units or to
receive dividends (except for dividend equivalent rights that may be awarded
with respect to the restricted stock units).
 
The Committee at its discretion may waive
the restriction period.

Norfolk

Southern Corporation
Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan

The
Board adopted the Norfolk Southern Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan
(“TSOP”) on Jan. 26, 1999, to promote the success of Norfolk
Southern by providing an opportunity for nonagreement employees to acquire a
proprietary interest in Norfolk Southern and thereby to provide an additional
incentive to nonagreement employees to devote their maximum efforts and s
ki
lls to the advancement, betterment, and prosperity
of Norfolk Southern and its stockholders.
 

TSOP has not been and is not required to have been approved by
stockholders.
 
There are 6,000,000 shares
of authorized but unissued Common Stock reserved for issuance under TSOP.

Active full-time nonagreement employees residing in
the
United States
 or
Canada

are eligible for selection to receive TSOP awards.
 
Under TSOP, the Committee may grant
nonqualified stock options subject to such terms and conditions as
provided in TSOP.

The
option price will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of
Norfolk
 Southern's Common
Stock on the effective date the options are granted.
 
All options are subject to a vesting
period of at least one year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten
years.
 
Options awarded in 2007 are
subject to a three-year vesting period.
 

TSOP specifically prohibits option repricing without stockholder
approval, except for capital adjustments.

Norfolk

Southern Corporation
Directors' Restricted Stock Plan

The
Norfolk Southern Corporation Directors' Restricted Stock Plan
(“Plan”) was adopted on
Jan. 1, 1994
, and is designed to increase ownership of
Norfolk Southern Common Stock by its non-employee directors so as to further
align their ownership interest in
Norfolk

Southern with that of stockholders.
 

The Plan has not been and is not required to have been approved by
stockholders.
 
Currently, a maximum
of 66,000 shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock may be granted under the
Plan.
 
To make grants to eligible
directors,
Norfolk
 Southern purchases, through
one or more subsidiary companies, the number of shares required in open-market
transactions at prevailing market prices, or makes such grants from Norfolk
Southern Common Stock already owned by one or more of
Norfolk
 Southern's subsidiary companies.

Only
non-employee directors who are not and never have been employees of
Norfolk
 Southern are
eligible to participate in the Plan.
 

Upon becoming a director, each eligible director receives a one-time
grant of 3,000 restricted shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock.
 
No individual member of the Board
exercises discretion concerning the eligibility of any director or the number
of shares granted.

The
restriction period applicable to restricted shares granted under the Plan begins
on the date of the grant and ends on the earlier of the recipient’s death
or six months after the recipient ceases to be a director by reason of
disability or retirement.
 
During
the restriction period shares may not be sold, pledged or otherwise
encumbered.
 
Directors will forfeit
the restricted shares if they cease to serve as a director of
Norfolk
 Southern for reasons other than their
disability, retirement or death.
